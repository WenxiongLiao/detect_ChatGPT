"PA AND LATERAL CHEST, [**2102-4-16**] 
OMPARISON:  [**2102-4-14**]. 
FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Airspace consolidation in the left lower lobe has worsened and is concerning for an evolving pneumonia.  Subtle hazy ground-glass opacity lateral to right hilum could reflect an additional site of infection.  Bronchial wall thickening is mild and suggest coexisting airways infection or inflammation.  Small pleural effusions are present bilaterally, left greater than right. 
IMPRESSION:  Evolving pneumonia in left lower lobe as well as possible new site of infection in right perihilar region.  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 35223**] was telephoned with these findings on [**2102-4-16**] at 10 a.m.",0

Right greater than left perihilar opacities are seen, (may relate to volume overload, although a superimposed atypical pneumonia or less likely asymmetric interstitial edema).  The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.

IMPRESSION: 1.  Small right pleural effusion, better demonstrated on abdominal ultrasound. 2.

The tip of the newly placed left internal jugular line extends beyond the course of the left brachiocephalic vein. No evidence of pneumothorax or change in mediastinal caliber was noted. The previously observed small left pleural effusion has increased in size and has been fluctuating. Vascular caliber in the region of the azygos vein appears enlarged, indicating increased central venous pressure. This finding may explain the deposition of additional edema in the region of the possible right upper lobe pneumonia. Furthermore, the left lower lobe consolidation appears to be worsening.

The endotracheal tube is correctly positioned, and the nasogastric tube can be seen passing into the stomach. Mild cardiomegaly has also increased.

COMPARISON:  CT chest from earlier the same day at 14:29 hours.  
AP UPRIGHT CHEST:  The heart size is likely normal but obscured by trace effusion. TECHNIQUE: AP upright chest radiograph.

FINDINGS: The heart size appears obscured by a trace effusion, making assessment of normal cardiac size difficult. The lungs are clear and there are no focal consolidations, pneumothorax, or pleural masses. No evidence of major vascular abnormalities or bony abnormalities is noted. The osseous structures and surrounding soft tissues appear unremarkable.

Comparison is made with the prior study dated [**2121-10-7**]. There are multiple tubes and catheters in place, including a left chest tube, with no significant positional changes noted compared to the previous examination. The heart appears normal in size without any signs of vascular congestion or consolidations. Due to the supine positioning, the assessment for pneumothorax (PTX) or effusion is suboptimal. However, there is minimal change observed from the semi-erect examination conducted one day ago, which suggests a small PTX on the left side. Overall, there is no demonstrable short interval change, ruling out pneumonia or congestive heart failure (CHF). No PTX is identified on this delayed graft function evaluation when compared to the prior study dated [**2121-10-7**].",1

The patient's clinical history includes a prior history of grade III intraventricular hemorrhage with ventriculomegaly, with the current imaging study being performed for follow-up evaluation. The examination reveals interval development of a patchy opacity in the left lower lung zone, indicative of air space disease. There is also obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, which may be partially attributed to a left pleural effusion.

"INDICATION:  Thymoma, presenting with new cough.   Assess for infiltrates.  
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from [**2165-10-3**]. The chest radiograph reveals a large anterior mediastinal mass, measuring approximately 9 x 8 cm in diameter. The mass demonstrates homogenous density with lobulated margins. There is no evidence of infiltrates, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The heart size is normal, and the pulmonary vasculature appears unremarkable. The bony structures are intact without evidence of fractures or lytic lesions. 

IMPRESSION: The chest radiograph findings are consistent with a large anterior mediastinal mass, highly suspicious for thymoma. Additional imaging studies such as CT or MRI may be recommended to further characterize the mass and evaluate for local invasion or metastases. Further workup, including biopsy or excision, may be indicated for definitive diagnosis. The new cough may be attributed to the mass effect of the thymoma, although other etiologies should also be considered. Clinical correlation and follow-up are recommended.",1
"EXAMINATION:  Portable abdomen.  
INDICATION:  Abdominal distension. The portable abdominal film reveals marked abdominal distension. The bowel gas pattern is moderately dilated, suggestive of bowel obstruction.

"INDICATION:  [**Location (un) 6813**] syndrome.  
COMPARISON:  No previous studies. The current study was compared to a previous study done earlier the same day. Interstitial markings are still prominent, indicating the presence of interstitial lung disease. There is increased density in the retrocardiac area, suggesting atelectasis and/or consolidation. Additionally, there is blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus, which is consistent with pleural fluid accumulation. The heart and mediastinal structures appear unchanged. The feeding tube remains misplaced in the region of the lower esophagus, with its tip projected in the lower cervical esophagus. A PICC line is also present on the right side, as seen in the previous study. No significant additional findings are noted.
