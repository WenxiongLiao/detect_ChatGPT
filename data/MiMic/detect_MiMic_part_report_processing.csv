"PA AND LATERAL CHEST: [**2155-3-13**]. 
INDICATION:  Cough and hypernatremia. 
Comparison: CXR [**2155-3-12**]. 
The heart is mildly enlarged.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  The thoracic aorta is diffusely calcified and unfolded.  There is minimal bibasilar atelectasis.  The posterior CP angles are blunted representing either tiny bilateral pleural effusions or pleural scarring.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  There is minimal right apical pleural scarring. the pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Again seen, is a compression fracture of the 8th vertebra of uncertain chronicity.  There is minimal loss of height of the T4 vertebra which may represent some mild compression as well. 
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia."
"CLINICAL INDICATION: Congestive heart failure. 
An intra-aortic balloon pump is present, in a relatively low position, terminating slightly more than 6 cm below the superior aspect of the aortic knob. A Swan-Ganz catheter is slightly distal in location, terminating just beyond the left hilar contour. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable in the interval. There is vascular engorgement, perihilar haziness, and a bilateral interstitial pattern. Also noted are partially layering pleural effusions on this semi-erect study. 
Overall, compared to previous study, the pleural effusions and congestive heart failure pattern appear worse. 
IMPRESSION: 1. Low position of intra-aortic balloon pump and slightly distal position of Swan-Ganz catheter, as detailed above. 2. Slight progession of congestive heart failure pattern with associated development of bilateral pleural effusions."
"PRE-OPERATIVE PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY, [**2174-8-11**] AT 18:51 HOURS 
HISTORY:  Mitral regurgitation, pre-operative for mitral valve repair. 
COMPARISON:  None. 
FINDINGS:  There is a right pleural effusion with a component extending within the major fissure resulting in hazy opacification of the right lung base on AP view.  There is associated atelectasis.  No definite consolidation is noted although evaluation of this region is limited.  Elsewhere, there is no pneumonia.  The mediastinum is unremarkable.  The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits for size.  There is no pneumothorax.  The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION:  Right pleural effusion with associated basilar atelectasis.  No definite superimposed consolidation is seen.  Preliminary report was provided by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]."
"HISTORY:  61-year-old female with end-stage liver and renal disease with probable diffuse pneumonia. 
Comparison is made to prior radiographs dated [**2-27**] and [**2113-3-3**] and prior CT dated [**2113-2-28**]. 
SINGLE UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH 
Since most recent radiograph, there appears to be mild improvement to the moderate pulmonary edema and patchy opacities likely representing multifocal pneumonia.  Bilateral pleural effusions and left lower lobe atelectasis are stable in appearance.  Right and left central venous catheters are unchanged and tip of Dobbhoff tube is now noted to be within the distal duodenum or jejunum. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Interval improvement to moderate pulmonary edema and multifocal pneumonia. 
2.  Stable appearance to bilateral pleural effusions and dense retrocardiac opacity."
"INDICATION:  Labile blood pressure and rising creatinine. 
RENAL ULTRASOUND:  Both kidneys are small with the right kidney measuring 9.7 cm, and the left kidney measuring 8.9 cm.  No renal masses, hydronephrosis, renal calculi are present.  Limited color and Doppler son[**Name (NI) **] evaluation was performed, as the patient was unable to cooperatively suspend respiration. Arterial waveforms obtained within the right and left kidneys demonstrate normal acceleration times and systolic upstrokes, and the waveforms were symmetric bilaterally. 
IMPRESSION:  Limited evaluation as the patient was unable to appropriately suspend respiration.  Arterial waveforms obtained demonstrate bilaterally symmetric waveforms with normal upstrokes and acceleration times, without specific evidence for renal artery stenosis."
"INDICATIONS:  Decreased breath sounds in the right base. 
PA AND LATERAL CHEST:  Comparison is made to [**2121-6-9**].  Heart remains mildly enlarged.  There is an increasing right effusion with associated increased opacity in the right lower lobe, which could be due to atelectasis or pneumonia.  There is engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature, consistent with CHF.  There is widening of the right apical pleural margin, seen adjacent to a surgical staple line.  The amount of widening is unchanged. 
IMPRESSION:  Increasing right pleural effusion.  Worsening right lower lobe opacity due to atelectasis or pneumonia.  Continued mild fluid overload/CHF."
"INDICATION:  86-year-old male with Wegener's granulomatosis, referred for followup of right pleural effusion. 
COMPARISON:  [**2123-11-30**]. 
PA AND LATERAL CHEST: 
Large right pleural effusion is unchanged in size.  There is associated right basilar atelectasis/scarring, also stable.  Healed right rib fractures are noted.  On the left, there is persistent apical pleural thickening and apical scarring.  Linear opacities projecting over the lower lobe are also compatible with scarring, unchanged.  There is no left pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are difficult to assess, but appear unchanged.  Vascular stent is seen in the left axillary/subclavian region. 
IMPRESSION:  Unchanged right pleural effusion.  Stable multifocal scarring and left apical pleural thickening."
"INDICATION:  Fever and dyspnea. 
PORTABLE CHEST:  Comparison is made to film from 2 days earlier. 
The study is limited by motion artifact.  Right and left central venous catheters are without obvious change.  Midline structures are stable.  No definite acute change is seen on the right.  On the left, however, there is a new large area of increased density in the left retrocardiac area with silhouetting of the hemidiaphragm and blunting of the left lateral costophrenic angle.  This probably reflects left pleural effusion and associated atelectasis; pneumonia cannot be excluded. 
IMPRESSION: 1)  Study limited by motion artifact. 2)  New pleuro-parenchymal abnormalities at the left base as described."
"CHEST: 
INDICATION: S/P CABG surgery. Chest tube removed. Patient desaturating. R/O CHF. 
FINDINGS: A single AP upright view. Comparison study dated [**2188-10-26**]. There appears to have been some increase in cardiac size, mainly left ventricular. S/P CABG surgery again noted. The pulmonary vessels show some upper zone redistribution, new since the previous study. There is slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle. Minor linear atelectasis is noted in the basal segments of the left lower lobe behind the heart. Elsewhere, the lungs are clear. 
IMPRESSION: The findings suggest that the patient is developing some left ventricular failure since the previous postoperative study. Further follow up images are recommended to assess progress. Clavicle fracture again noted."
"INDICATION:  Septic shock, left subclavian line placement, evaluate for position. 
COMPARISON:  [**2114-12-5**]. 
CHEST, AP:  There is interval removal of the Swan-Ganz catheter.  No pneumothorax is visualized.  A left-sided subclavian vein central line is now visualized with its tip in the proximal superior vena cava.  Patchy atelectasis is seen in the right lung base.  There is marked tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Upper zone redistribution of pulmonary vasculature is also identified.  Patchy opacities are seen bilaterally. 
IMPRESSION:  Patchy bilateral opacities indicating atelectasis and postop aspiration pneumonia."

CLINICAL INDICATION: Dyspnea on exertion. 
Comparison is made to studies of [**2125-4-13**] and [**2125-4-14**]. 
FINDINGS: There is cardiomegaly with prominence of the left ventricle.  The mediastinum is prominent, stable from the previous exams and consistent with adenopathy seen on the CT examination.  There are bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.  The effusion on the right is large and fluid is seen tracking laterally along the lung and also into the minor fissure.  There is no redistribution of the pulmonary vasculature.  A dense consolidation is seen in the posterior left base.  The aorta is unfolded and calcified.  Median sternotomy wires are unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax. 
IMPRESSION: Worsening bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left. Interval development of CHF.  Consolidation within the posterior left base could represent additional pneumonia."

TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright portable radiograph of the chest. 
COMPARISONS:  Multiple chest radiographs, most recently [**2168-1-20**]. 
FINDINGS:  Cavitated consolidation in the left upper lung is overall unchanged.  Right basal bullous changes with more conspicuous thickened walls than expected based on recent CT findings. It is uncertain if this is due to surrounding fluid or secondary infectious process. Atelectasis and effusion is present at the left base. Tracheostomy tube is in appropriate position.  Left subclavian line terminates in the proximal SVC.  Enteric tube courses into the stomach and out of view. 
IMPRESSION: 1. Unchanged left upper lung cavitated consolidation. 2. Bullous changes in the right lung base with possible surrounding infection. 3. Unchanged small left pleural effusion."

COMPARISON:  [**2172-1-13**] chest radiograph at 02:26 a.m. 
CHEST RADIOGRAPH(PORTABLE AP): The nasogastric tube ends in the right lower lobe bronchus. Endotracheal tube ends 7 cm above the carina.    Supraclavicular central venous catheter ends in the low superior vena cava.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Bilateral pulmonary edema has resolved in the short interval.  The cardiac silhouette is normal.  The thoracic aorta is generally enlarged and calcified but unchanged. 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Malpositioned, endobronchial nasogastric tube.  Findings were reported by phone at 11:55 a.m. by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19792**] to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2688**] on [**2172-1-13**]. 
2.  Interval resolution of bilateral pulmonary edema."
"CHEST: 
INDICATION: End stage renal disease with volume overload. Left IJ central line for dialysis. Hypothermia. Check status. 
FINDINGS: A single AP supine image is provided. Comparison study dated [**2138-10-25**]. There is again evidence of marked cardiac enlargement involving all [**Doctor Last Name 4121**]. This is associated with changes in the lungs consistent with some left heart failure. In addition, there is again evidence of left lower lobe collapse/consolidation behind the heart. The positions of the ETT, the NG line, the right IJ central line and the left subclavian line all remain satisfactory. Some midline skin staples are noted over the upper abdomen. 
IMPRESSION: No significant change in the appearances of the enlarged heart and associated left heart failure. The atelectasis/consolidation in the left lower lobe is unchanged."

COMPARISON:  [**2116-5-20**]. 
SUPINE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A right-sided internal jugular double lumen central venous catheter, endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and left-sided internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter are in unchanged position.  The left-sided Swan- Ganz catheter tip appears to be in the right interlobar artery. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is increased pulmonary edema when compared to the prior examination. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Increasing pulmonary edema. 2.  Right Swan-Ganz catheter in right interlobar artery, unchanged compared to the prior examination. 
Findings were discussed with the house staff officer, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12000**] at 9:10 p.m."
"PORTABLE CHEST: 
CLINICAL INDICATION:   ARDS and septic shock. 
An endotracheal tube has been advanced in the interval and is now terminating within 2 cm of the carina.  Other lines and tubes are in satisfactory position.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  Bilateral pulmonary opacities show overall interval improvement compared to the previous study with residual hazy areas of increased opacity as well as some more confluent opacification at the lung bases particularly in the left retrocardiac region. There are probable bilateral pleural effusions. 
IMPRESSION: 
1)  Low position of endotracheal tube, as communicated to the clinical service caring for the patient. 2)  Improving pulmonary opacities."
"MEDICAL HISTORY:  63-year-old, evaluate for CHF. 
COMPARISON: [**2130-11-23**]. 
PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Again seen are median sternotomy wires. The patient has a history of CABG.  Low lung volumes.  Heart size demonstrates stable cardiomegaly.  A right pneumothorax remains which has decreased in size compared to the prior radiograph.  Bilateral calcified pleural plaques are seen in keeping with prior asbestosis exposure.  Lungs are stable compared to the prior radiograph.  Osseous structures are unremarkable.  Note is made of a Swan-Ganz catheter introducer sheath tip lying in the SVC. 
IMPRESSION: 
1)  Stable cardiomegaly. 
2)  Resolving right apical pneumothorax. 
3)  Low lung volumes.  No change from previous radiograph."
"CHEST, SINGLE VIEW ON [**10-1**]. 
HISTORY:  Rhonchi on exam. 
FINDINGS:  There are no old films available for comparison.  The heart is moderately enlarged.  It is difficult to assess the right hilar region due to overlying cardiac and mediastinal structures.  It is unclear if it is slightly enlarged or if there is volume loss or adenopathy in this region.  There are vague nodular densities noted throughout both lungs. 
IMPRESSION:  Nodular opacities in both lungs and prominent right hilar region. No old films available for comparison.  It would be helpful to have a CT scan to further evaluate these findings, old films and more history cannot be obtained.  These findings were called to the house staff at the time of dictating this report."
"INDICATION:  59-year-old man with known HIV, elevated LFTs with bilirubin. Perform ERCP to rule out ampullary stenosis and AIDS cholangiopathy. 
ERCP:  8 fluoroscopic spot images obtained in the ERCP suite without the presence of radiologist were submitted for review.  These demonstrate normal course and caliber of common bile duct, common hepatic duct, right and left hepatic ducts, biliary radicles and cystic duct.  No intraluminal filling defects or extrinsic compression was seen. 
IMPRESSION:  Normal biliary tree without evidence of intraluminal filling defects or external compression."
"INDICATION:  59-year-old female status post right nephrectomy. Assess lung infiltration. 
COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to [**2192-6-5**] 
TECHNIQUE:  AP upright single view of the chest. 
FINDINGS:  There is a right IJ central line with the tip likely in the right atrium as before.  There is interval removal of right-sided chest tube.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax in this radiograph.  There are again noted bibasilar patchy opacities, which are not significantly changed when compared to prior study.  There is a question of a hiatal hernia. There are skin staples overlying the right flank. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  No evidence of pneumothorax. 2.  Bibasilar patchy opacities are not changed when compared to prior study. They most likely represent atelectasis rather than pneumonia."
"CT OF THE HEAD DONE ON [**2112-5-12**]. 
CLINICAL INDICATION:  Craniotomy, evaluate interval changes. 
TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast CT of the head with 5-mm axial images are obtained. 
COMPARISON:  [**2112-3-3**]. 
SCAN FINDINGS:  There is as before, a right frontal craniotomy with a large area of decreased density throughout the right frontal and parietal lobes consistent with developing encephalomalacia, as before.  There is some hyperdensity within the right frontal sulci which may represent mineralization, as before, stable. These findings are consistent with a large right frontoparietal infarct. There is ex vacuo dilatation of the right lateral ventricle.  The remaining brain parenchyma demonstrates no evidence of acute infarction, hemorrhage, or mass lesion. 
IMPRESSION: 
Stable chronic large right frontoparietal infarction.  Intervl cranioplasty."
"CLINICAL HISTORY:  54-year-old male with end stage renal disease with shortness of breath and hypoxia.  Please evaluate for change from prior or presence of new infiltrates.

IMPRESSION:  No significant change from prior examination dated [**2187-8-9**]."
"INDICATION:  Tachypnea and large left effusion, check ETT placement. 
AP SUPINE CHEST:  Compared to AP upright chest of 10 hours prior.  There has been interval intubation, with the tip of the endotracheal tube approximately 6.5 cm above the carina.  There is a left pleural draining catheter, with persisiting left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  There remains a small right pleural effusion.  The remaining right lung field is clear.  Again identified is a right-sided PICC line with its tip in the brachiocephalic vein and a percutaneous biliary draining catheter. 
IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory ETT placement. S/P pleural drainage catheter with persisting large effusion, not significantly changed allowing for differences in technique."
"INDICATION:  Leg swelling. 
TECHNIQUE:  Standard duplex son[**Name (NI) 948**] of both limbs was performed. 
REPORT: 
RIGHT SIDE:  There is normal compressibility, augmentation and respiratory variation of the deep veins of the right leg.  Some mild edema is identified. No other focal abnormalities are identified and there is no evidence of thrombosis. 
LEFT SIDE:  Normal augmentation, compressibility and respiratory variation in the deep veins of the left side are seen.  There is quite marked subcutaneous edema of the left side.  There is a duplicated right saphenous vein.  No evidence of thrombosis. 
CONCLUSION: 1.  Bilateral leg edema. 2.  No evidence of deep venous thrombosis on either side. 3.  Duplicated vein left side."
"CHEST: 
INDICATION:  Anterocutaneous fistula.  Line placement. 
IMPRESSION:  The tip of the right jugular Swan-Ganz catheter is in the right main PA.  Increased moderate congestive heart failure with cardiomegaly and bilateral pleural effusion.  Bibasilar patchy atelectasis. 
COMMENT:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest is reviewed, and compared with previous study of yesterday.  The tip of the new right jugular Swan-Ganz catheter is identified in the right main PA.  No evidence of pneumothorax is identified. 
There is increased moderate congestive heart failure with cardiomegaly and increased bilateral pleural effusion.  There is also increase in bibasilar patchy atelectasis. 
The tip of the endotracheal tube is identified 3 cm above the carina.  A feeding tube courses towards the stomach.  There is continued tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  The left jugular IV catheter is in place."
"INDICATION: Evaluate for ligamentous injury, attempted hanging. 
TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1, T2, STIR images were performed of the cervical spine. 
FINDINGS:  The cervical vertebral bodies are normal in height, signal intensity and alignment. The intervertbral disc spaces are normal.  The cervical spinal cord demonstrates normal signal intensities.  There is mild thickening of the ligamentum flavum at the T3 vertebral level.  This is a nontraumatic finding, related to degenerative change.  There is no abnormal signal intensity in the posterior paraspinal soft tissues.  The spinous processes appear normal. 
IMPRESSION: There are no areas of abnormal signal intensity to suggest edema.  The spinal cord appears normal.  The cervical vertebral bodies appear normal.  No acute traumatic process is identified involving the cervical spine."
"PORTABLE CHEST: 
Compared to [**4-20**]. 
INDICATION: Pulmonary embolism and pneumonia. 
The heart is mildly enlarged, and there is vascular engorgement and perihilar haziness as well as peribronchial cuffing. New in the interval is hazy increased opacity in the right mid and lower lung zone as well as additional patchy areas of opacity in the retrocardiac region and a linear opacity in the left mid lung zone. 
Calcified structure overlying the left upper hemithorax is noted and corresponds to an area of abnormality in the posterior chest wall on recent chest CTA. 
IMPRESSION: 1) Congestive heart failure with perihilar edema. 
2) Probable right pleural effusion. 
3) Patchy and linear mid and lower lung zone opacities, which could be related to the history of pulmonary embolism with areas of atelectasis and/or infarction."
"HISTORY:  Left PICC placement. 
COMPARISON:  [**2106-7-27**]. 
CHEST:  AP semi-upright portable view.  The new left PICC terminates at the junction of the superior vena cava and the right atrium.  The nasogastric tube has been advanced, terminating in the region of the gastric antrum.  Lung volumes are larger than on [**7-27**], but the left hemithorax remains hazy, consistent with a pleural effusion.  There is no pulmonary edema or consolidation. 
PICC position was reported to intravenous therapy nurse [**Doctor First Name 147**] at 3:30 p.m. on [**2106-7-30**]. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Satisfactory PICC position. 2.  Left pleural effusion.                                                                       DFDkq"
"CLINICAL HISTORY:  Prior history of grade III intraventricular hemorrhage with ventriculomegaly.  Follow-up. 
Comparison is made with the previous examination of [**11-21**].  Again there is bilateral germinal matrix and intraventricular hemorrhage with some evidence for evolution since the previous examination.  No new hemorrhage is identified and no parenchymal hemorrhage or ischemic change is seen.  The lateral and third ventricles are dilated, slightly larger than on the previous examination.  Color Doppler interrogation of the anterior cerebral artery at the genu, however ranges between .73 and .83 and with compression of the anterior fontanelle does not increase and ranges between .72 and .88. 
IMPRESSION:  Progressive evolution of the bilateral germinal matrix and intraventricular hemorrhage with associated ventriculomegaly.  No change in the resistive indeces at this time to suggest worsening intracranial compliance."
"INDICATION:  Colitis. Bibasilar rales. 
COMPARISONS: [**2100-11-23**] 
CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  Again seen is a dual lumen catheter with tip in the SVC. The heart size is within normal limits.  There are diffuse patchy bilateral interstitial infiltrates.  Compared to the previous exam, some of areas have worsened in the interval such as in the left mid lung zone and in the right lower lobes.  again seen are several compression deformities of the thoracic spine. 
ABDOMEN, TWO VIEWS:  There is a normal bowel gas pattern.  Residual contrast material is seen in the descending colon. There is no free intraperitoneal air. Clips are seen in the mid abdomen and epigastric regions. 
IMPRESSION:  Diffuse, patchy interstitial opacities consistent with atypical pneumonia. Some areas are slightly worse than previous exam from 3 days prior. Normal abdominal film."
"INDICATION:  Fall with residual neck pain. 
TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the cervical spine. 
COMPARISONS:  Cervical spine radiographs on [**2137-10-10**]. 
FINDINGS:  C1 through T2 are visualized on lateral view.  There is no fracture or malalignment of the cervical spine.  There is no prevertebral soft tissue edema.  Mild degenerative changes are again noted at C5-C6 unchanged from [**2137-10-10**].  Fusion hardware at the thoracic spine is partially visualized.  The airway and lung apices are within normal limits. 
IMPRESSION:  Mild cervical DJD, unchanged from [**2137-10-10**]. 
The results of this study were relayed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 703**] [**Name (STitle) 14258**] to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1562**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 24424**] by phone at 4:13 p.m. on [**2141-3-9**].                                                                       MJMgb"
"INDICATION:  Preop film for MVR/CABG. 
PORTABLE CHEST:  Comparison made to film of one day earlier. 
There is limited evaluation of cardiac and mediastinal contours due to technique, rotation and adjacent parenchymal abnormality. 
There is ongoing CHF, with primarily diffuse interstitial edema. Aeration does appear slightly worsened today, although this could be due, at least in part, to less good inspiratory effort.  There is worsened aeration at the left base as well, with new silhouetting of the diaphragm and left lateral CP angle, suggesting new or increased left pleural effusion.  Superimposed pneumonia at the left base cannot be excluded. 
IMPRESSION: 1)  Ongoing CHF, which appears slightly worsened today (vs less inspiratory effort). 2)  Worsened aeration at the left base with evidence of new or increased left pleural effusion."
"INDICATION:  Right-sided scapular pain. 
THREE VIEWS OF THE RIGHT SCAPULA:  Tis an oblique fracture of the superior portion of the lateral edge of the scapula which does not extend to the glenohumeral articular surface.  There is no displacement of fracture fragments.  The glenohumeral joint is intact with no fractures of the humeral head.  The clavicle and AC joint are unremarkable.  There is no dislocation noted of the humeral head.  No rib fractures are noted. 
IMPRESSION:  Fracture of the superior lateral portion of the scapula not involving the glenohumeral articular surface.  These findings were communicated to the patient's clinicians."
"HISTORY:  Increased respiratory distress. ? pulmonary edema. 
Single portable chest radiograph is compared to a prior study dated [**2136-12-5**]. There has been interval removal of the ET tube and NG tube.  The right IJ line is unchanged.  There is increasing alveolar opacity involving the right lower lobe as well as the left apex, probably representing worsening infectious process (probably bacterial).  There is blunting of both costophrenic angles. The cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Clips within the right upper lung zone probably represent a previous lobectomy. 
IMPRESSION:  Increasing alveolar opacity involving left upper and right lower lobes probably representing worsening pneumonia.  There is bilateral pleural effusion."
"AP CHEST 8:03 A.M. ON [**1-28**] 
HISTORY:  Papillary muscle rupture. 
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**1-27**]: 
Lung volumes are lower than at 6:58 p.m. on [**1-27**], and mediastinal veins are more dilated but there is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or postoperative enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Swan-Ganz catheter tip projects over the right descending pulmonary artery. ET tube is in standard placement and a pair of midline drain is in place, but the nasogastric tube ends above the gastroesophageal junction explaining a distended stomach. 
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1474**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5203**] was paged to report these findings, at the time of dictation."
"HISTORY:  Septic arthritis status post hardware removal. 
Three radiographs of the right knee are submitted. 
Assessment for joint effusion is limited by positioning.  No fracture is evident.  Joint spaces are unremarkable on nonweightbearing views.  Regional soft tissues are unremarkable.  No periarticular erosions are identified. Osseous remodeling of the inferior pole of the patella may represent the sequela of remote trauma. 
IMPRESSION: 
Limited study secondary to patient positioning. 
Probable remote trauma of the patella. 
If available, comparison with previous radiographs would help to better assess for interval change."
"INDICATION:  Subdural hematoma post drainage. 
COMPARISON:  [**2161-2-14**]. 
TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT. 
FINDINGS:  The drain has been removed from the subdural collection on the left.  There remains a thin rim of hypodense fluid about the left cerebrum and 2-3 mm of shift of normally midline structures toward the right.  The subdural hematoma involving the tentorium is less apparent on today's examination.  The ventricles are again prominent.  The [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation is preserved.  Pneumocephalus has resolved. 
Craniotomy site is identified and there is soft tissue prominence at the region of surgical intervention on the scalp. 
IMPRESSION:  Persistent left sided thin rim of hypodense subdural collection. Decrease in conspicuity of tentorial subdural hematoma.  Resolved pneumocephalus."
"AP CHEST 12:50 P.M. ON [**5-20**] 
HISTORY:  Left chest tube removed. 
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**5-19**] and [**5-20**] at 6:30 a.m.: 
Tiny left apical pneumothorax is unchanged and little if any appreciable left pleural effusion is present following removal of the left pleural tube.  Right perihilar consolidation persists probably pneumonia.  Some of the variability in mediastinal and right hilar widening is due to vascular engorgement, but there is also lymph node enlargement and fat deposition demonstrated by previous chest CT scans.  The lower portion of the cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged but unchanged.  Small right pleural effusion may be present, stable. Previous pulmonary edema is largely cleared."
"AP PORTABLE CHEST, [**2164-10-21**] at 1544 HOURS 
HISTORY:  Chest pressure and palpitations for past several days.  Noted to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response on EKG. 
COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated [**2164-8-17**]. 
FINDINGS:  The study is somewhat compromised secondary to AP portable technique and rotation.  Within that limitation, no consolidation or edema is evident.  The extensive postsurgical changes throughout the mediastinum and sternum again noted and stable.  The cardiac silhouette is borderline enlarged but stable.  No effusion or pneumothorax is noted.  The osseous structures are grossly unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION:  No acute pulmonary process.  In particular, no evidence for heart failure."
"INDICATION:  51-year-old man with cirrhosis and TIPS.  Clinically, somewhat improved after TIPS revision. 
COMPARISON:  [**2175-8-30**]. 
FINDINGS:  A TIPS stent is visualized, with wall-to-wall color flow and velocities ranging from 55 cm/sec to 98 cm/sec. 
Appropriate flow and waveforms were obtained within the right hepatic artery, and main hepatic artery.  No flow is visible within the left portal vein, and flow could not be definitively obtained from the right portal vein. Incidentally noted is some sludge within the gallbladder. 
IMPRESSION:  Wall-to-wall color flow within the TIPS, with increased velocities since the prior study, likely related to recent intervention."
"HISTORY: 42-year-old man with ascites and Hep C.  Please assess endotracheal tube position. 
PORTABLE AP CHEST AT 8:00 P.M.: 
COMPARISON:  Comparison made to prior study of [**2178-12-2**]. 
FINDINGS: When compared to the prior study, the patient has been intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube is at the level of the aortic arch.  There is no change in the position of the NG tube or the right internal central venous catheter.  Retrocardiac density is present which may represent infiltrate or aspiration. 
IMPRESSION: ETT tip at level of aortic arch. No pneumothorax. Retrocardiac density may be aspiration or infiltrate."
"CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Motor cycle accident. 
CONTRAST NECK CT WITH MULTIPLANAR REFORMATTED IMAGES: 
FINDINGS:  There are multiple fractures involving the lateral mass of C7 on the left side.  There is involvement of the transverse process, the left side of the lamina, the pars interarticularis of the facet region and the foramen transversarium. There is a fracture of the posterior aspect of the right second rib.  There is extensive subcutaneous emphysema.  There is no evidence of malignment. 
IMPRESSION:  Fracture of the lateral mass of C7 on the left with involvement of the foramen transversarium.  This is a potentially unstable fracture. Fracture of the posterior aspect of the second rib on the right.  Subcutaneous emphysema noted and incidental note is made of a small right apical pneumothorax."
"HISTORY:  Severe tracheal stenosis 3 cm below vocal cords, now intubated, assess tube placement. 
CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW. 
The patient is status post sternotomy, with prosthetic valve.  An NG tube is present, extending beneath diaphragm overlying the gastric body.  An ET tube is present -- the tip lies at the level of the thoracic inlet, high in relation to the carina (approximately 8 cm above the carina).  The lungs are grossly clear, without CHF, focal infiltrate, or effusion. 
IMPRESSION: 
ET tube tip high at thoracic inlet and should be advanced.  Findings paged to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 694**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 14361**] at 10:25 p.m. on the night of the exam."
"Comparison is made with examination performed on [**8-8**] in this child with history of intraventricular hemorrhage with parenchymal extension. 
There has been little overall change. There is no substantial ventriculomegaly. There is increasing organization of the intraventricular clot on the right. The smaller intraventricular clot on the left is also well organized. Once again noted is the large intraparenchymal hemorrhage on the right side. I believe there is a smaller intraparenchymal hemorrhage on the left side. This is not as clearly seen on prior exam though I do believe it is present. 
IMPRESSION: Relatively stable exam with organizing intraventricular hemorrhage without substantial ventriculomegaly and bilateral intraparenchymal extension."
"INDICATION:  Intubated for respiratory failure likely due to an infectious process. 
SINGLE VIEW CHEST:  Comparison is made to the prior study dated [**2170-3-25**].  The endotracheal tube appears to be in appropriate position.  The left subclavian line again terminates at the level of the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein.  This study is limited by low lung volumes.  However, there appears to be increased opacity in the left retrocardiac region which may relate to pleural fluid and atelectasis.  There is also a probable right- sided pleural effusion. 
IMPRESSION:  Limited study.  Probable bilateral pleural effusions."
"INDICATION:  67-year-old man with neutropenic fever, right total hip arthroplasty.  Evaluate for effusion and destruction. 
COMPARISONS:  None. 
FINDINGS:  Four views of the right hip were obtained.  The patient is status post right total hip arthroplasty.  Hardware is in place without signs of complications.  No periprosthesis lucency or fracture is identified.  No dislocation is seen.  Single AP view of the left hip demonstrates degenerative changes with joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis.  Foley catheter and retained barium in right lower abdomen are noted.  A non-obstructive bowel gas pattern overlies the sacrum, obscuring complete evaluation. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  No evidence of joint effusion. 2.  Right total hip arthroplasty without hardware complications. 3.  Left hip degenerative changes."
"REASON FOR EXAM: Status post CABG eval CVA. 
Study is an I-minus head CT. 
FINDINGS: There is a right frontal-temporal-parietal-occipital lobe hypodensity consistent with CVA with involvement of the insula but sparing of the [**Doctor First Name 6926**] ganglia. There is a focus of high density in the temporal [**Doctor Last Name 39**] raising the possibility of hemorrhage or calcified choroid plexus. There is possibility of clotted atrial vein of the temporal lobe. There is 9 mm right- to-left subfalcine midline shift. Overall there is no significant change with comparison of previous study from day prior. 
IMPRESSION: Large right frontal-temporal-parietal-occipital lobe CVA with midline shift. No significant change from study done on prior day."
"INDICATION:  66-year-old woman postop day 7 for excision of pelvic mass. Assess for ileus. 
COMPARISON:  None. 
FINDINGS:  Supine and erect view of the abdomen demonstrate a nonspecific bowel gas pattern without obstruction or ileus.  No free air or pneumatosis is present.  No ureteral stents are visualized.  Multiple surgical clips overlie the abdomen and pelvis.  Degenerative changes are present of the lower lumbar spine. 
IMPRESSION:  Nonspecific bowel gas pattern without evidence of ileus or obstruction."
"INDICATION:  18-year-old with facial fractures, pneumocephalus.  Please evaluate for progression. 
COMPARISON:  CT of head of [**2190-3-3**], and [**2190-3-2**]. 
TECHNIQUE:  CT of the head without IV contrast. 
FINDINGS:  Lentiform fluid collections in the right and left frontal regions are unchanged in size.  Pneumocephalus within these fluid collections also has not significantly changed.  However, there is development of some frontal contusion and intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right subfrontal region.  No new areas of contusion or hemorrhage are identified.  Multiple facial fractures and opacification of multiple sinuses is unchanged. 
IMPRESSION: 
1)  Developing right subfrontal contusion. 
2)  Stable appearance of frontal epidural fluid collections. 
3)  Unchanged amount of pneumocephalus."
"RIGHT ELBOW, THREE VIEWS. 
INDICATION:  55-year-old man status post trauma. 
FINDINGS:  Comparison to [**2150-8-16**].  No definite acute fracture or dislocation is seen.  However, a linear lucency is seen along the lateral aspect of the radial head, non-specific.  No joint effusion is noted.  Diffuse soft tissue swelling about the elbow is seen.  An intravenous line is seen in the antecubital fossa.  Previously described densities are not seen on the current study, suggesting that they were outside of the patient. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Focal lucency of the radial head is seen only on one view and may be artifactual.  Consider further evaluation with CT to evaluate. 2.  Diffuse soft tissue swelling about the elbow."
"INDICATION:  84-year-old woman with known intracranial hemorrhage and mental status changes.  Evaluate for progression of hemorrhage. 
COMPARISON:  Examination on [**2120-10-12**]. 
FINDINGS:  Overall, there has been no significant change from the prior examination. 
Again, there is a left frontal intraparenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhage as well as a right parietooccipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage with subarachnoid blood in the quadrigeminal endplate cistern and the ambient cisterns.  There is no new hemorrhage.  There is mild mass effect upon the left lateral ventricle with minimal rightward midline shift.  The brain parenchymal signal is unchanged. 
IMPRESSION:  No change in the intraparenchymal hemorrhages in the left frontal and right parietooccipital regions.  No new areas of subarachnoid blood.  The previously mentioned areas of subarachnoid blood have continued to evolve."
"REASON: TIA. 
FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation is performed in both carotid arteries. Minimal plaque is identified bilaterally. 
On the right peak systolic velocities are 63, 64, 84 in the ICA, CCA and ECA respectively. The ICA to CCA ratio is 1.2. This is consistent with a less than 40% stenosis. 
On the left peak systolic velocities are 74, 49, 63 in the ICA, CCA, and ECA respectively. The ICA to CCA ratio is 1.5. This is consistent with a less than 40% stenosis. 
There is antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries. 
IMPRESSION: Minimal plaque with bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis."
"AP CHEST, 12:47 P.M., [**2116-1-20**] 
HISTORY:  Elevated white count and respiratory alkalosis.  Suspect pulmonary edema. 
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**2117-1-14**] through [**2117-1-18**]: 
Symmetric bilateral perihilar opacifications in the mid and upper lung zones has improved since [**2117-1-17**] and previous moderate right pleural effusion has decreased substantially.  The comparative changes are due to improved cardiac function.  Reviewing prior chest radiographs, this admission suggests a preceding left lung pneumonia.  Whether there is any contribution of fat embolism syndrome to the edema, it would depend upon the time course of therapy for the patient's long bone fractures. 
Right jugular line ends in the mid SVC.  No pneumothorax."
"PROCEDURE:  AP portable chest 
INDICATION:  S/P chest tube removal. Evaluate change in pneumothorax. 
Comparison is made to a prior examination of the same day at 17:45 hours. 
FINDINGS:  A left subclavian central venous line and NG tube are seen in unchanged position.  There has been interval removal of one of the two left- sided chest tubes.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Left basilar atelectasis with small left effusion, and right pleural effusion with a small area of right basilar atelectasis are again seen, unchanged.  The cardiomediastinal borders are unchanged. 
IMPRESSION:  Interval removal of one of two left-sided chest tubes with no pneumothorax identified."
"INDICATION: This is a newborn baby girl who had the fetal diagnosis of situs inversus. 
FINDINGS:  A single portable view of the chest and abdomen was obtained.  I have no prior films available for comparison.  The NG tube tip appears to be in the superior portion of a right-sided stomach.  Air is seen within bowel loops that are exclusively right-sided.  It is difficult to discern the outline of the liver. 
The heart size and axis is within range of normal limits.  Neither lung is fully expanded, but both appear clear.  Twelve ossified repairs are present and there are no vertebral or rib abnormalities seen. 
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal abdominal situs with the stomach clearly being right- sided."
"INDICATION:  70-year-old female with 1 week of dyspnea now with hypotension. 
COMPARISONS:  Comparison is made to AP chest radiograph from [**2139-7-15**]. 
TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  A single portable AP view of the chest was reviewed. Cardiomegaly is stable.  Interval increase in pulmonary vasculature prominence with associated bilateral pleural effusions is concerning for worsening congestive heart failure.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Stable retrocardiac consolidation is seen and may reflect atelectasis and/or pneumonia.  There is no interval change in a right lower lobe ill-defined patchy opacity, which may reflect a developing pneumonia. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Interval increase in pulmonary vascular congestion with associated bilateral pleural effusions, indicating worsening CHF. 2.  Stable right lower lobe opacity, which could be developing pneumonia. 3.  Stable moderate cardiomegaly. 4.  Unchanged left lower lobe consolidation."
"HISTORY:  Left upper lobe lobectomy. 
PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate interval removal of the left-sided chest tube seen on chest radiographs obtained earlier the same day. There is a small apical left-sided pneumothorax.  There is persistent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and gaseous distention of the stomach.  No effusion is identified on the lateral projection.  No consolidation is evident.  Increased lung volumes and linear interstitial opacities represent COPD, unchanged.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous. 
IMPRESSION: 
Interval removal of left-sided chest tube with new, small, left apical pneumothorax.  No shift of the midline structures. 
COPD, unchanged."
"REASON FOR THE EXAMINATION:  This is a 60-year-old woman with congestive heart failure and volume overload. The request is to evaluate for DVT in her left leg stump. 
COMPARISON:  No relevant priors are available. 
FINDINGS:  Limited examination due to patient's body habitus.  Duplex evaluation was performed on the left lower extremity veins.  There is normal compression and augmentation of the common femoral, proximal femoral, mid femoral, distal femoral and popliteal veins.  There is normal phasicity of the common femoral vein bilaterally. 
IMPRESSION:  Very limited examination.  No evidence of left lower extremity deep vein thrombosis."
"INDICATION:  CVL placement. 
COMPARISONS:  Comparison is made to radiograph performed in the same day approximately 12 hours earlier. 
TECHNIQUE:  AP semi-upright single view of the chest. 
FINDINGS:  There is a left IJ dialysis catheter with the tip in the right atrium.  There is interval removal of the Swan-Ganz catheter and interval placement of a right IJ central line with the tip in the SVC.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours remain unchanged.  There is persistent opacity in the right hilum and left retrocardiac region which are similar to the prior study. NG tube has been removed. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Interval placement of a right IJ central line with the tip in the mid SVC. 2.  Unchanged bilateral lung parenchymal opacities."
"INDICATION:  Retroperitoneal bleed with right internal jugular Cordis line placement. 
COMPARISON:  None. 
UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates at the SVC/right atrial junction.  There are low lung volumes. The heart size is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contour is unremarkable. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis, but infection cannot be completely excluded. There is a small right pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is identified. There are no acute osseous abnormalities. 
IMPRESSION:  Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminating at the SVC/right atrial junction.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Patchy opacities in lung bases may reflect atelectasis.  Small right pleural effusion."
"CLINICAL INDICATION: Intubation. GI bleed. 
There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube, terminating approximately 5.1 cm above the carina. Allowing for low lung volumes, cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits. There is some crowding of the pulmonary vessels but there are no focal areas of consolidation. No pneumothorax is evident. 
A double contour of the right hemidiaphragm is noted and is likely due to projection. This is not typical for free intraperitoneal air. 
IMPRESSION: 1. Endotracheal tube terminates 5 cm above the carina. 2. Double density of the right hemidiahragm, likely projectional. If there is clinical suspicion for free intraperitoneal air, a fully upright chest radiograph or a left lateral decubitus abdomen view would be helpful to fully exclude this possibility."
"HISTORY:  64-year-old female with ethanol cirrhosis, evaluate for focal liver lesion. 
COMPARISON:  Abdominal ultrasound [**2153-4-2**] and multiple priors. 
ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND:  The liver is quite echogenic, heterogeneous in appearance, related to patient's known cirrhosis.  There is a stable cyst adjacent to the gallbladder fossa measuring 1.6 x 1.9 x 2.0 cm.  The gallbladder itself is contracted and stone-filled, with posterior acoustic shadowing indicative of cholelithiasis.  The main portal vein is patent, with antegrade flow.  There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, and the common bile duct measures 4 mm. 
There is no ascites.  The spleen measures 11.6 cm and is normal in size. 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Cirrhosis, with heterogeneous, echogenic liver. 2.  Stable cyst adjacent to gallbladder fossa. 3.  Cholelithiasis."
"INDICATION: Prematurity. 
FINDINGS: Single frontal portable view of the chest and abdomen was performed. There are several uniformly distended gas filled loops of bowel throughout the abdomen. Overall distention is slightly greater than would be expected normally. We do, however, seem to see gas all the way to the rectum. This may represent an ileus; please correlate clinically. There is an NG tube, whose distal tip projects over the expected location of the stomach. Hazy opacification throughout both lungs suggests Surfactant deficiency. There is probably more focal atelectasis in the retrocardiac region. 
IMPRESSION: Mild to moderately dilated uniformly distended gas filled loops of bowel throughout the abdomen. The gas seems to extend to the rectum. Clinical significance of this finding is unknown and should be correlated clinically."
"INDICATION:  Status post cath with sepsis. 
COMPARISON:  Radiograph dated [**2169-3-30**]. 
AP SUPINE VIEW OF THE CHEST:  There is interval placement of a right-sided subclavian line terminating in the right atrium.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  There is pulmonary vascular congestion with upper zone redistribution, which may be partially postural in nature.  No areas of confluent consolidation are identified.  No definite pleural effusion.  No evidence of pneumothorax on this supine view of the chest. 
IMPRESSION: 1)  Right subclavian line terminating in the right atrium.  Subsequent followup study that was available at the time of interpretation of this study demonstrates interval retraction into the SVC.  No evidence of pneumothorax on this supine view of the chest. 2)  Pulmonary vascular congestion that may be partially postural in nature, consistent with mild or early CHF."
"EXAM:  CT of the head. 
CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Status post biopsy. 
TECHNIQUE:  Axial images of the head were obtained without contrast. 
FINDINGS:  Since the previous CT examination obtained on the same day on [**2116-1-24**] at 3 p.m., patient has undergone biopsy with air is seen in the frontal region.  Contrast is visualized in the vascular system.  There is partial obliteration of the quadrigeminal cistern identified with some edema seen in the partially visualized left cerebellar hemisphere.  No hemorrhage is seen in the right frontal region. 
IMPRESSION:  Examination performed post-biopsy/third ventriculostomy.  Air is seen in the frontal region and in the right frontal lobe.  No hemorrhage identified.  Partially visualized is edema and enhancing lesion in the left cerebellar hemisphere."
"TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view. 
INDICATION:  Status post trauma with left-sided diaphragmatic rupture. Left-sided chest tube now removed.  Followup examination. 
FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest obtained with the patient in supine position is analyzed in direct comparison with a similar previous study obtained 8 hours earlier.  The patient remains intubated.  Position of NG tube and left subclavian approach central venous line also unchanged.  The left-sided chest tube has now been removed and the lung remains expanded without evidence of pneumothorax.  No new parenchymal infiltrates have developed. 
IMPRESSION:  Uncomplicated removal of chest tube."

There is interval removal of the right-sided PICC.  Port-A-Cath is in stable position.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. 
IMPRESSION:  Plate like atelectasis in left mid lung zone, and subtle, streaky opacity at the left lower lung zone best appreciated on the AP view, that may localize to the lingula. This may represent atelectasis or early pneumonic infiltrate."
"HISTORY:  Respiratory failure. 
A single portable radiograph of the chest excludes the right lateral hemithorax.  Left-sided pleural effusion is worse when compared to [**2154-11-16**]. A radiopaque catheter projects over the left lower hemithorax.  It is unclear if this is external to the patient.  There may be a small right-sided effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The patient is again seen to be status post median sternotomy.  Diffuse increased airspace opacities and prominence of the pulmonary vasculature persists. 
IMPRESSION: 
Persistent mild CHF.  Left-sided effusion and retrocardiac opacity, unchanged. 
Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and left-sided PICC all in place. Radiopaque catheter projecting over the left lower hemithorax is new.  It is unclear if this is external to the patient."
"INDICATION: History of aspiration for enteral feeding. 
An 8 French feeding tube was passed into the left naris and under fluoroscopic guidance was passed through the stomach into the third portion of the duodenum. Confirmation of position was obtained by multiple spot films as well as spot films after a small injection of Conray into the gut lumen. The tube was fixed into place; there were no complications. 
IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated postpyloric feeding tube placement under fluoroscopic guidance."
"INDICATION:  Status post emergent repair of AAA. 
COMPARISON:  Series of radiographs, most recent dated [**2158-10-1**]. 
FINDINGS:  ET tube terminates approximately 2.5 cm above the carina.  A right subclavian line is at the level of distal SVC.  Nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm and out of view.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Bilateral pleural effusions, small, left greater than right.  There is unchanged left retrocardiac density.  There are increased interstitial pulmonary markings bilaterally, with perihilar haziness, suggestive of increasing failure/fluid overload.

2)  Mild splenomegaly. 
3)  Minimal pelvic free fluid."
"INDICATION:  75-year-old woman, evaluate line placement. 
COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph of approximately three hours earlier. 
PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST AT 10:55 A.M.:  A right central venous line is seen, however, respiratory motion limits the accurate identification of the catheter tip.  The catheter tip appears to extent to the level of the cavoatrial junction.  There is no pneumothorax. Again seen is a left lower lobe consolidation.  Widened mediastinum due to cardiomegaly and tortuous aorta is unchanged. No pneumothorax. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Respiratory motion limiting accurate identification of the catheter tip. The tip appears to project at the level of the cavoatrial junction. 2.  Redemonstration of left lower lobe pneumonia."
"INDICATION:  Pre-operative, aortic valve replacement. 
TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest without comparisons. 
FINDINGS:  There is borderline enlargement of the heart.  Within the right lower lung zone, there is a 4 mm, rounded and well-demarcated opacity. Additionally, on the lateral view there is a 1 cm opacity overlying the anterior portion of the approximately T10 vertebral body.  No other pulmonary opacities, pleural effusions, or pneumothorax.  Degenerative change within the spine is noted. 
IMPRESSION: 1)  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease. 2)  Borderline cardiomegaly without evidence of failure. 3)  Two pulmonary opacities are identified.

"AP CHEST, 1:26 P.M. ON [**6-24**] 
HISTORY:  55-year-old woman with a history of prior pneumonia.  Evaluate for interval change. 
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**6-20**] through 5: 
Right basal consolidation continues to clear, now almost radiographically undetectable.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  Heart is normal size.  Persistent effacement of the aortopulmonic window since the end of [**Month (only) 6512**] be a normal anatomic variant, or could be due to adenopathy in that location, even though I see no indication of adenopathy elsewhere in the mediastinum.  Neither is there any pleural abnormality.  Tracheostomy tube is in standard placement. Feeding tube ends in the upper stomach.  Left PIC line tip projects at the origin of the SVC."
"PA AND LATERAL CHEST, [**10-2**] 
HISTORY:  CABG.  Right chest tube removed.  Evaluate for pneumothorax. 
IMPRESSION:  Right apical pneumothorax is tiny.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are present and left lower lobe atelectasis has improved.  The small region of right suprahilar consolidation seen earlier on the day is projected more inferiorly on the frontal view behind the right hilus, but the lateral view shows that it is in the superior segment of the right lower lobe and not appreciably changed.  Followup is advised. 
Cardiomediastinal silhouette has a normal postoperative appearance.  Right jugular line ends just above the junction of brachiocephalic veins."
"HISTORY:  Shortness of breath. 
Single portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates abnormal interstitial opacity involving both lungs with mild sparing of the right mid lung.  Trachea is midline and demonstrates a ""saber sheath"" configuration.  No effusion is detected.  A left-sided PICC line is present with its tip in the SVC.  No pneumothorax.  There is increased airspace opacity superimposed on the abnormal interstitial pattern. 
IMPRESSION: 
Abnormal opacity involving both lungs with relative sparing of the right mid lung.  The findings are better assessed on subsequent CT examination. Diagnostic considerations include both pneumonia and/or pulmonary edema. 
Left-sided PICC line with its tip in the SVC."
"INDICATION:  40-year-old female status post MVC with intermittent right upper lobe collapse. 
Comparison is made to serial chest radiographs from [**2120-5-7**], to the most recent of [**2120-5-14**]. 
FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal.  There is stable widening of the mediastinum.  Endotracheal tube, right apical chest tube and a left-sided central venous line are identified in standard positions.  A Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view.  Moderate right lower lobe atelectasis with associated moderate right pleural effusion is unchanged. There is improved left basilar atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is identified. 
IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change in moderate pulmonary edema and right lower lobe atelectasis.  No evidence of pneumothorax."
"PORTABLE CHEST, [**2178-9-14**] COMPARED TO PREVIOUS STUDY OF ONE DAY EARLIER. 
CLINICAL INDICATION: Motorcycle crash. Intubation. 
An endotracheal tube remains in satisfactory position. A right-sided chest tube, central venous catheter and nasogastric tube also remain in place, unchanged in position. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable in the interval. 
Multifocal lung parenchymal opacities persist, located centrally within the right upper lobe, right middle lobe and right lower lobe, as well as in the left perihilar region. When compared to the recent study, this is not considered significantly changed. 
There is probably a small right pleural effusion present. Right-sided rib fractures are noted. 
IMPRESSION: Multifocal lung parenchyma opacities, which may represent pulmonary contusion in this patient with history of trauma. An infectious process is also possible in the appropriate clinical setting."

"HISTORY: 27 and 3/7th week premature infant, now 1 month old. R/O PVL. Study is compared with the prior examination of [**2199-11-13**]. 
FINDINGS: Images in sagittal and coronal planes through the anterior fontanelle demonstrate normal cerebral parenchyma without evidence of periventricular leukomalacia or other abnormality. The lateral ventricles are mildly prominent, unchanged since the prior study. The third ventricle is normal. No evidence of intraventricular hemorrhage is seen. Mastoid views demonstrate normal appearing posterior fossa with normal fourth ventricle. The study focuses on the parenchymal and ventricular anatomy, however, no gross extra-axial fluid collection is appreciated. Comparison with the prior examination shows essentially no interval change. 
IMPRESSION: Findings remain within normal limits and are unchanged since the prior examination."

HISTORY:  Repositioning NG tube. 
A single supine view of the abdomen.  A nasogastric tube is present with its tip in the region of the body of the stomach.  A sidehole is not identified. The diaphragm is not entirely included on the film.  The bowel gas pattern is unremarkable.  Soft tissues are unremarkable.  Multiple surgical staples are projected across the upper abdomen.  A single radiopaque tube projected across the right upper quadrant is consistent with a drain.  There is a mild levoscoliosis with accompanying degenerative arthritic change. 
IMPRESSION:  Nasogastric tube terminates in the region of the stomach."
"INDICATION:  Motorcycle accident, insertion of endotracheal and nasogastric tubes. 
FINDINGS:  Comparison to a radiograph performed seven hours ago indicates that the tip of the endotracheal tube remains 6 cm above the carina and could be advanced by approximately 2 cm.  The tip of the nasogastric tube is projected over the gastroesophageal junction and should also be advanced by approximately 5 cm.  The heart and lungs appear normal. Calcified mediastinal adenopathy, multilevel degenerative joint disease of the thoracic spine are stable findings. 
IMPRESSION:  The endotracheal tube should be advanced by approximately 2-3 cm. The nasogastric tube should be advanced approximately 5 cm.  Otherwise stable appearance."
"INDICATION: Shortness of breath. 
CHEST, 1 VIEW: Compared to [**2119-3-9**], the ETT, NG tube and post pyloric feeding tube remain in satisfactory position. The feeding tube is coiled overlying the neck although it is unclear if this is external to the patient. A left IJ central venous catheter again terminates in the mid SVC. No pneumothorax. 
The heart size remains within normal limits. The right pleural effusion has increased in size. No definite left pleural effusion is identified. Right middle and lower lobe collapse is unchanged. Left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity is also stable.

CHEST, AP SUPINE:  Endotracheal tube terminates 3.6 cm from the carina, and a nasogastric tube terminates just beyond the gastroesophageal junction.  A large right pneumothorax is present, with air dissecting into the chest wall. Widening of the intercostal spaces is concerning for tension.  The left lung is clear.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum has a wide appearance, which could reflect tortuous aorta versus vascular injury. Multiple rib fractures right posterior chest cage are not displaced. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Large right pneumothorax, with probable tension.  This was paged to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 10510**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 65227**] on [**2116-5-4**] at 7:13 a.m. 2.  Prominent mediastinal contour may represent aortic tortuosity versus traumatic hematoma. 3.  Multiple nondisplaced right posterior rib fractures."
"CHEST RADIOGRAPH 
INDICATION:  Assess for infiltrates, status post Bentall procedure. 
TECHNIQUE:  Supine portable chest view was read in comparison with multiple prior radiographs with the most recent from [**2104-5-18**]. 
FINDINGS: 
Since [**2104-5-18**], bilateral lung opacities likely from moderate pulmonary edema has improved.  Right lower lung opacity due to combination of atelectasis and effusion is minimally improved.  Another opacity in the left upper chest due to known loculated effusion is partially obscured by an overlying artifactual opacity and its assessment was limited.  Increased retrocardiac density reflecting left lower lung atelectasis is overall unchanged.  There is evidence of prior median sternotomy and sternal sutures are intact.  Monitoring and supporting devices are in standard position and unchanged since prior study. 
IMPRESSION: 
Since [**2104-5-18**], mild pulmonary edema has improved.  Bibasilar opacities likely from combination of effusion and atelectasis have minimally improved."
"INDICATIONS:    40 y/o with diabetes and presumed sepsis, unknown source. 
COMPARISONS:  None. 
The nasogastric tube is coiled within the stomach.  The lung volumes are low and there is patchy air space opacity at both lung bases which may represent patchy atelectasis or pneumonia or aspiration. Clinical correlation is advised.  No pneumothorax is evident.  Overall, the heart appears to be within normal limits and the mediastinal contours are within normal limits for portable AP study.  No acute bony abnormality is appreciated on this single film. 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Bilateral patchy air space opacities which could reflect pneumonia, aspiration, or patchy atelectasis.  Followup imaging should be considered. Clinical correlation is advised.  Low lung volumes."

COMPARISONS:  Comparison is made to [**2195-8-23**]. 
TECHNIQUE:  Supine and upright views of the abdomen. 
FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of free air.  Again noted are bilateral pleural effusions as described in the chest radiograph.  There is a G-tube within presumably within the stomach.  The patient is status post posterior spinal fusion of the lumbar spine, which appears unchanged when compared to the prior study.  There is air in the colon and throughout the GI tract in a non-specific distribution.  There is no evidence of small small-bowel obstruction or free air.  Skeletal structures are grossly unchanged. There are surgical clips in the pelvis. 
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of small bowel obstruction or free air."
"INDICATION:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with constipation. 
COMPARISON:  None. 
UPRIGHT AND SUPINE VIEWS OF THE ABDOMEN AT 12 P.M.:  There are multiple nondistended air-filled loops of small and large bowel.  A moderate amount of fecal material fills the colon to the cecum.  Air is present within the rectum. There is no evidence of obstruction or ileus.  There is no evidence of free air under the diaphragm.

"HISTORY: Coarse breath sounds and increased secretions. 
FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST: Comparison is made to [**2201-4-22**] and [**2201-5-7**]. The patient is status post sternotomy. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. The lung volumes are low. Allowing for low lung volumes, there is no definite CHF. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. In addition, there is increased density posteriorly on the lateral view, likely in the right lower lobe given volume loss at the right base on the frontal view. 
IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly with small bilateral effusions but no overt CHF. Lower lobe consolidation, likely on the right. Recommend a followup after therapy to ensure resolution."
"INDICATION:  Chest tube placement. 
SINGLE VIEW CHEST:  Comparison is made of prior radiograph dated the same day at 9:25AM.  The ET tube terminates 5 cm from the carina.  There is a right IJ sheath in place with the tip seen at the upper SVC no pneumothorax is present.  Note is made of kinking at the insertion site.  There is a left-sided chest tube.  There are bilateral pleural effusions right greater than left.  There is a persistent retrocardiac opacity which is likely atelectasis in this post- op patient.  The NG tube is seen to course to the stomach but the tip is not included on the present radiograph. 
IMPRESSION:  1)  Left-sided chest tube placement; persistent bilateral pleural effusions right greater than left. 2)  Retrocardiac opacity likely atelectasis in this post-op patient."
"CHEST, SINGLE AP FILM 
History of seizure and intubation. 
Endotracheal tube is 5 cm above carina.  NG tube extends below diaphragm. Right jugular CV line is in the region of the distal SVC.  Chest is rotated to the left.  Lying full supine rotated film.  Heart size is borderline to slightly enlarged.  There is opacity of the left base obscuring the left hemidiaphragm consistent with consolidation/aspiration.  Associated small effusion cannot be ruled out on this single supine view.  In addition, linear and subsegmental atelectases are present in the right lower zone.  No pneumothorax. 
IMPRESSION: 
Left basilar opacity consistent with aspiration/consolidation.  Right lower zone atelectasis.  No pneumothorax."
"PORTABLE CHEST: 
Compared to previous study of 1 day earlier. 
INDICATION: S/P mitral valve surgery. 
Since the previous study, the patient has been extubated. Chest tubes, mediastinal drain, and Swan-Ganz catheter remain in place. The left chest tube has a low position but is unchanged. The heart remains enlarged. The pulmonary vasculature demonstrates upper zone redistribution but there has been interval slight decrease in degree of perihilar haziness. A few scattered interstitial opacities persist. There is worsening retrocardiac opacity on the left. A small left pleural effusion is new in the interval. 
IMPRESSION: 1) Slight improvement in degree of congestive heart failure. 
2) Worsening left retrocardiac opacity, most likely due to atelectasis. Aspiration is an additional consideration."
"HISTORY:  Chest tube, poor gas exchange. 
Compared to study dated [**2123-1-8**], lines and tubes remain in place.  A left apical pneumothorax is not substantially different.  Subcutaneous emphysema is again noted and air tracks along the left hemidiaphragm has been noted previously.  Compared to prior film there is slight increase in density in the left mid lung field and could represent a developing air space process.  No other interval changes are demonstrated.  Continued follow up is recommended. 
IMPRESSION: 1. Stable left apical pneumothorax. Slight increase in density of left mid lung which should be followed up to evaluate for possible evolving air space process. 2. Subcutaneous emphysema."
"INDICATION:  Post-CABG. 
COMPARISON:  Preoperative chest radiograph available from [**2163-4-26**]. 
FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Multiple intact sternal wires and mediastinal clips denote recent cardiac surgery.  A right-sided PICC terminates at the upper SVC.  Since [**2163-4-26**], there has been interval placement of an ET tube terminating 3.3 cm above the carina, a Swan-Ganz catheter terminating at the ventricular outflow tract, an orogastric tube terminating within the stomach, and appropriately positioned abdominal drains and bilateral thoracostomy tubes.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis is present. Mild pulmonary edema has improved. 
IMPRESSION:  Appropriate position of multiple post-surgical support lines.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion."
"INDICATION:  Respiratory failure and GI bleed. 
COMPARISONS: [**2116-8-28**] at 5:44 
FINDINGS:  Compared to prior study there is now a nasogastric tube with tip coiled in the stomach.  Swan ganz catheter is seen with tip in main pulmonary outflow tract. The endotracheal tube is just above the carina (1.5 cm)  and should be pulled back 3 cm.   The right introducer sheath remains in place. 
There is no pneumothorax.  Shallow level of inspiration is again observed. Current study seems to show slight increase in opacity in the right chest likely due to worsening fluid status.  However, technical differences could account for some of these apparent changes. 
IMPRESSION: 
Endotracheal tube should be pulled back 3 cm as it is just above the carina. 
Limited study, however, I do suspect some worsening in fluid status."
"INDICATION:  Fever to 103 on dialysis with a new Perma-Cath, evaluate for effusions or infiltrates. 
COMPARISON:  [**2160-3-23**]. 
AP UPRIGHT AND LATERAL CHEST:  A tunneled dialysis catheter line is seen with its tip unchanged in position.  Bilateral chest tubes are present entering in the upper mid abdomen with their tips directed towards their respective costophrenic angles.  Again there are sternal wires.  The left internal jugular catheter and a central chest tube have been removed.  The cardiac size is unchanged.  Again there are patchy opacities throughout both lung zones which have improved since the prior study.  There are minimal effusions. 
IMPRESSION:  Improved appearance to the pulmonary parenchyma with minimal pleural effusions."
"INDICATION:  Left cerebellar and intraventricular hemorrhage with continued somnolence.  Evaluate status of hemorrhage. 
TECHNIQUE:   Axial non-contrast CT scans of the brain were obtained. 
Comparison is made to the CT and MRI examinations of [**2172-7-21**]. 
FINDINGS:  As noted on the MRI examination, right frontal ventricular catheter has been placed.  The ventricles are not dilated.  There is no change in the appearance of the left cerebellar hemorrhage or intraventricular component of the blood.  Scattered areas of hypodensity are noted in the basal ganglia and white matter, consistent with multiple lacunar infarctions. 
There is no shift of midline structures. 
IMPRESSION: 
Stable appearance of the brain, compared to the studies from [**2172-7-21**]."
"INDICATION:  61-year-old man status post right nephrectomy with right chest tube to water, please assess for interval change of pneumothorax. 
COMPARISON:  [**2189-4-26**] 12:31 and 13:46. 
SINGLE PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Again seen is a right-sided chest tube.  There is an apparent small right apical pneumothorax.  An orogastric tube with a side hole projects below the diaphragm.  Heart size is top normal for technique.  There is an left basilar atelectasis.  There is no large effusion.  Air is seen under the right hemidiaphragm in this status post right nephrectomy patient. 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Right apical chest tube in place with associated small right apical pneumothorax. 
2.  Left basilar opacification likely atelectasis."
"MRI SCAN OF THE CERVICAL SPINE 
HISTORY:  58-year-old woman with left-sided weakness following a fall. 
TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1, T2, and STIR images of the cervical spine were obtained, with axial T2 and gradient echo scans. 
COMPARISON STUDY ON PACS ARCHIVE:  CT scan of the cervical spine from [**2184-11-14**]. 
FINDINGS:  Unfortunately, nearly all of the images are moderately to severely degraded by motion artifacts.  Within these significant diagnostic limitations, there is no overt cervical disc or vertebral abnormality.  There is no definite sign for spinal stenosis or overt paraspinal soft tissue abnormality. 
CONCLUSION:  Marginally interpretable study, without overt pathology identified.  Perhaps with premedication, the patient would be better able to tolerate this scan, if still deemed clinically necessary."
"INDICATION:  71-year-old male status post thoracotomy and left lower lobe lobectomy, now requiring assessment for interval change. 
COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiograph from [**2116-9-26**], [**2116-9-25**], [**2116-9-24**], and [**2116-9-23**]. 
FINDINGS:  PA and lateral images of the chest demonstrate interval worsening of left lung opacity.  The entire left hemithorax is now again opacified. Opacification is likely due to a large left pleural fluid collection in the setting of lobectomy versus less likely left lung collapse.  There is persistent significant elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  The right lung is clear.  There is no right pleural effusion.  Cardiac size cannot be assessed due to obscuration by the left hemithorax opacification.  The mediastinum is not shifted. 
IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in the opacification of left hemithorax, likely consistent with large left pleural effusion.  Right lung is clear."
"HISTORY:  Hydrocephalus. 
Assess for ventricular size. 
TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT scan. 
FINDINGS:  Comparison with the prior study of [**2189-1-15**] revealed mild reduction in ventricular size.  A ventricular shunt catheter is seen entering the brain via the right frontal lobe with its tip at the junction of the anterior margin of the septum pellucidum and the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 39**]. 
There is a metallic density in the region of the anterior communicating artery creating considerable streak artifacts, apparently representing the residium of prior coiling procedure. 
Finally, there is mild right frontal lobe encephalomalacic change along the inferior surface of this portion of this brain. 
CONCLUSION:  Mild residual hydrocephalus as noted above.  Status post insertion of ventricular shunt device."
"INDICATION:  Evaluation for pleural effusions. 
TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph was obtained. 
COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to prior radiograph from [**2201-8-30**]. 
FINDINGS:  There are bilateral small pleural effusions, unchanged in comparison to prior radiograph.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears enlarged in comparison to prior radiographs and may be representative of pericardial effusion.  Bilateral interstitial opacities consistent with mild pulmonary edema persist. No pneumothorax. 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  New enlarged cardiac silhouette which may be representative of pericardial effusion. 
2.  Mild pulmonary edema and bilateral small pleural effusions persist."
"HISTORY:  Hernia. 
Two portable radiographs of the abdomen demonstrate a normal bowel gas pattern.  Oral contrast material, stool, and air are seen within a normal caliber colon.  No pneumoperitoneum detected.  The domes of the bilateral hemidiaphragms are excluded.  No upright radiograph is available for correlation.  Degenerative change is seen about the pubic symphysis.  Surgical staples project over the midline of the pelvis.  Radiopaque tubing projects over the right lower quadrant.  The nasogastric tube seen on [**2185-7-25**] has been removed. 
IMPRESSION: 
Normal bowel gas pattern.  Assessment for pneumoperitoneum is limited by supine position, none is detected."
"INDICATION:  Evaluate subclavian line tip. 
COMPARISON:  CXR [**2200-10-16**] and multiple priors. 
FINDINGS:  Crosstable left lateral radiograph of the chest.  Subclavian line is seen with its tip terminating within the mid SVC.  Left-sided chest tube is again identified in comparing with the frontal radiograph from [**10-16**] and other priors it has been a longstanding fissural position.  The most proximal side port is likely just within the rib cage.  Bilateral moderate pleural effusions are again seen.  No pneumothorax identified.  Posterior spinal hardware is again seen. 
IMPRESSION:  Satisfactor position of left subclavian line with tip terminating in the mid SVC. No pneumothorax."
"PORTABLE HEAD ULTRASOUND, [**2156-1-15**]: 
CLINICAL HISTORY:  Infant born at 25 weeks' gestational age.  Now 3 weeks old with a left Grade II IVH.  One week follow-up study. 
FINDINGS:  The current study is compared to prior images dated [**2156-1-6**]. Scans were obtained through the anterior fontanelle as well as via a left mastoid approach.  The cerebral and cerebellar architecture are normal.  Note is once again made of clots in the region of the left thalamocaudate groove and also within the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 39**] of the left lateral ventricle.  There is no significant associated dilatation of the lateral ventricles.  No new hemorrhage is identified and the appearance of the clots is grossly unchanged. 
IMPRESSION:  No significant change compared to the prior study."
"INDICATION:  Evaluate VP shunt. 
TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT. 
COMPARISON EXAMINATION:  [**2151-1-30**]. 
FINDINGS:  Since that examination, there has been no change in the placement of the right frontal ventriculostomy catheter.  As before, the catheter does not appear to reach the ventricular system and terminates adjacent to the anterior falx in the right frontal region.  The size and shape of lateral ventricles are unchanged with prominence of the temporal horns.  There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. 
IMPRESSION:  The right frontal ventriculostomy catheter is unchanged in position, terminating outside of the ventricular system in the medial right frontal lobe.  There is mild prominence of the temporal horns with no worsening of hydrocephalus."
"INDICATION:  Followup pleural effusions, history of right hemicolectomy, respiratory failure, fever, status post thoracentesis. 
Comparison is made to films from [**2159-8-12**] to [**2159-8-20**]. 
PORTABLE SUPINE VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Large bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.  The increased density at both lung bases, left greater than right, could represent atelectasis or consolidation.  Tracheostomy tube, a left subclavian line, and NG tube remain in good position. 
IMPRESSION:  Large bilateral pleural effusions, unchanged."
"HISTORY:  MVR.  Possible pneumothorax. 
Two views.  Comparison with the previous study of [**2111-3-10**].  There is interval increase in a left pleural effusion, which now largely obscures the left heart border.  There is increased density in the retrocardiac area consistent with atelectasis or consolidation as before.  The right costophrenic sulcus is blunted.  The patient is status post median sternotomy and MVR.  The cardiac silhouette appears large.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified.  Mediastinal structures are probably unchanged.  The bony thorax is grossly intact. Degenerative arthritic changes are again demonstrated in the thoracic spine. 
Compared with the earlier study, a left pleural effusion has increased.  No pneumothorax is identified. 
IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in left pleural effusion."
"STUDY:  Abdomen supine and erect views, [**2200-12-20**]. 
HISTORY:  72-year-old male with nephrolithiasis and increasing abdominal pain. 
FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to the prior radiograph from [**2200-12-18**] as well as abdominal CT scan from [**2200-12-15**]. 
There is marked cardiomegaly.  The bowel gas pattern is nonspecific.  There is air seen throughout non-dilated loops of colon.  Stool is seen in the rectum. A few air-filled loops of small bowel are seen.  There is a calcification projecting over the left kidney renal pelvis and may represent small urinary calculi as seen on the prior CT scan.  Vascular calcifications are also identified. 
IMPRESSION: 
No signs of bowel obstruction or free intra-abdominal gas."
"INDICATION:  Mitral valve replacement and chest tube removal, exclude pneumothorax. 
COMPARISON:  Radiographs dated back to the preoperative radiograph of [**2166-4-11**] and most recently [**2166-4-22**]. 
FINDINGS:  The Swan-Ganz catheter, mediastinal drain, nasogastric and endotracheal tubes have been removed, and a right internal jugular vascular sheath remains in place.  The mitral valve apparatus and median sternotomy wires are unchanged in position and appearance. 
The radiograph excludes the lateral costophrenic recess at the right lung. Blunting of the left costodiaphragmatic angle suggests the presence of a small pleural effusion.  Bilateral retrocardiac opacity likely represents bibasal atelectasis.  A small lucency adjacent to the lateral costophrenic recess may represent a tiny hydropneumothorax, not included on the field of view of the prior radiograph. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Possible small left lateral costophrenic recess hydropneumothorax. 2.  Bibasal atelectasis."
"INDICATION:  75-year-old woman with critical aortic stenosis and pneumonia with respiratory distress. 
Portable AP chest is compared with the prior from 11 hours earlier.  The patient is slightly rotated.  Again seen is a right internal jugular central venous catheter terminating at the cavoatrial junction.  Given the difference in patient rotation, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  There is interval worsening of bilateral lung base opacities and right upper lung zone opacities.  There are bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax. The surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are stable.  Clips are seen in the right upper quadrant.

Right hemithorax is again diminished in size with interval improved expansion of right lung. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is unchanged.  The left lung remains clear and there is no evidence of left-sided pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen. 
IMPRESSION: No worsenning effusion or pneumothorax."
"LEFT ANKLE, [**2147-7-4**] 
CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Left ankle deformity, question fracture. 
FINDINGS: 
There is chronic subluxation of the tibiotalar joint with medial tilt of the talus.  There are severe degenerative changes of the tibiotalar joint with osteophyte formation.  There are apparent erosive changes at the distal tibia and at the distal fibula.  It is unclear as to whether this represents the sequela of prior inflammatory arthropathy or septic joint.  There is a moderate joint effusion.  There is spurring about the talus.

Comparison study dated [**6-8**] at 20:53. 
FINDINGS: Again seen is the tip of the endotracheal tube at the level of the thoracic inlet and abutting the left wall of the trachea, unchanged compared to prior study.  There is a nasogastric tube with tip in the stomach. The heart is stable in size.  Again seen is a patchy opacity in the right upper lobe which contains cavitation and air fluid levels and is slightly decreased in size in the interval. Again seen is [**Hospital1 **]-apical pleural thickening. 
IMPRESSION: 1) Slight improvement in right upper lobe necrotizing pneumonia, otherwise no change compared to prior study."
"INDICATION: S/P PICC line placement for TPN 
COMPARISON:  [**2142-6-28**] at 12:05 
PA AND LATERAL RADIOGRAPH:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is some minimal atelectasis at the right lung base.  A right PICC line tip extends to the cavoatrial junction.  The osseous structures are unremarkable.  There are probable small bilateral pleural effusions. 
IMPRESSION: 1)  PICC line tip extending to the cavoatrial junction. 2)  Right lower lobe atelectasis and possible small bilateral pleural effusions."

"RIGHT KNEE 
INDICATION:  Fall with knee effusion. 
COMPARISON:  None. 
RIGHT KNEE, THREE VIEWS:  Nonweightbearing AP and two shoot through lateral views demonstrate no fracture or evidence of bone destruction.  We could not evaluate for the presence of an effusion due to oblique lateral positioning. Dense vascular calcifications are evident.  Tricompartmental osteophytes are noted, one of which projects along the intercondylar notch on the frontal view. 
IMPRESSION:  No fracture detected.  Irregularity of anterior condyle on lateral view most likely relates to an osteohytes. Assessment for effusion is limited due to positioning.

"PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON [**2118-4-16**] - 12:43. 
INDICATION:  GI bleed and congestive heart failure. 
COMPARISON:  [**2118-4-13**] at 8:47. 
FINDINGS:  Compared to the prior study the pulmonary vasculature is less distended and better defined consistent with improvement in fluid status. Some congestive features persist.  There remains blunting at the right lateral costophrenic sulcus consistent with an effusion.  There are no new consolidations.  Some fluid tracks in the minor fissure. 
The heart size is enlarged but less so than that seen on prior. 
Pacemaker wire and tips are intact and properly positioned, respectively.  No pneumothorax. 
IMPRESSION: 
Persistent CHF features but improved vs. prior.  No new infiltrates."
"CHEST AP PORTABLE SINGLE VIEW. 
INDICATION:  Status post esophagogastrectomy, assess for pneumothorax. 
FINDINGS:  Nasal cannula in place.  NG tube passes through pull-through area and reaches below diaphragm.  Right-sided chest tube in place.  The small right-sided apical pneumothorax noted on the previous examination eight hours earlier cannot be identified anymore.  No new parenchymal pulmonary lesions can be identified, nor has an increased congestive pulmonary pattern developed.  Crowded appearance of pulmonary vasculature on the left base is suggestive of some mild atelectasis but no increased parenchymal infiltrates have developed since the next-previous examination.  Density in the stomach pull-through area indicates administration of some barium material. 
IMPRESSION:  Disappearance of small apical pneumothorax on the right side.  No new parenchymal infiltrates or significant CHF."
"HISTORY:  Cognitive decline and difficulty swallowing. 
Contiguous axial images were obtained through the brain.  Imaging was performed before and during intravenous administration of 100 cc of Optiray contrast.  Comparison to a neck CT of [**2147-3-23**]. 
FINDINGS:  Images of the brain demonstrate no evidence of mass, mass effect, edema, hemorrhage, or infarction.  There is no abnormal enhancement after contrast administration.  The brain imaging appears normal.  Again identified is opacification of the right mastoid air cells, unchanged since the study of [**2147-3-23**]. 
CONCLUSION:  The brain appears normal.  Again identified is right mastoid opacification."
"HISTORY:  70-year-old female with scoliosis, evaluate for interval change. 
COMPARISON:  [**2171-5-9**]. 
FINDINGS:  A right chest tube and right IJ central venous catheter are unchanged.  There has been interval extubation, resulting in lower lung volumes and increased conspicuity of mild pulmonary edema.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  A small pneumothorax is seen adjacent to the right hemidiaphragm; there is a small right pleural effusion. Dense retrocardiac opacity is increased compared with prior, compatible with atelectasis. There is a moderate sized air-filled hiatal hernia. 
Thoracolumbar spinal fusion hardware is grossly unchanged.

COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from [**2142-4-26**], dating back to [**2142-2-2**]. CT torso from [**2142-4-25**]. 
FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate that the right pleural effusion, which had been drained on the [**2142-4-26**] radiograph, has returned to the size it was on [**2142-4-25**].  In addition, there is right middle and lower lobe collapse.  There is no shift of mediastinal structures. The visible lung fields are clear.  There is no pneumothorax or left-sided effusion.

HISTORY:  Infrarenal triple AAA repair.  Possible pneumothorax. 
IMPRESSION:  AP supine chest compared to [**2125-9-10**]: 
The lung bases are excluded from the study.  Disparity in radiodensity of the upper lungs is due largely to moderate left pleural effusion and severe emphysema.  An upright view of the entire chest would of course be more reliable in excluding pneumothorax.  Tip of the ET tube at the upper margin of the clavicles is at least 9 cm from the carina, 4 cm above optimum placement. Right atrial and ventricular pacer and defibrillator leads are not fully imaged.  A left ventricular lead is unchanged in its position since at least [**2124-9-7**]. 
Mild edema is probably present in the left lung, though overlying pleural effusion can simulate edema."
"CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON [**2150-2-27**] 
Comparison with previous study from four hours earlier. 
CLINICAL HISTORY:  54-year-old woman with right subclavian central line placed, evaluate line position. 
FINDINGS:  Supine portable chest radiograph is obtained.  Low lung volumes limit evaluation.  Note is made of a new right subclavian central line with tip in the approximate location of the SVC.  Lungs demonstrate no evidence of pneumonia or CHF.  There is crowding of bronchial vasculature at the lung bases bilaterally.  There is no pleural effusion.  Mediastinal and hilar prominence likely relates to technique.  There is no pneumothorax.  Visualized osseous structures are intact. 
IMPRESSION: 
Limited study given supine portable technique. 
New right subclavian central line with tip in good position.  No pneumothorax.                                                                       SESHa"

IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**6-5**], 7:44 p.m.: 
Tip of the intraaortic balloon ends just above the left main bronchus, approximately 6 cm from the apex of the aortic knob.  Previous moderately severe pulmonary edema has improved.  Residual constellation of confluent nodular opacities in the right upper lung could be atypical edema, but should be followed to exclude pneumonia.  Heart size is normal.  ET tube and right internal jugular line are in standard placements and a nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view.  No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion."
"STUDY:  Carotid series complete. 
REASON:  Preop for CABG. 
FINDINGS:  Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid arteries. There is heterogeneous plaque in the proximal ICA bilaterally. 
On the right, peak velocities are 96, 66, and 92 cm/sec in the ICA, CCA, and ECA respectively.  This is consistent with less than 40% stenosis. 
On the left, peak velocities are 86, 80, and 83 cm/sec in the ICA, CCA, and ECA respectively.  This is consistent with less than 40% stenosis. 
There is antegrade flow in the right vertebral artery.  The left vertebral artery was not visualized. 
IMPRESSION:  Bilateral less than 40% ICA stenosis."

A left subclavian central venous catheter and left-sided PICC line remain unchanged.  No pneumothorax.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions. The trachea is midline. 
IMPRESSION: 
Persistent CHF.  Bilateral airspace opacities likely reflect pulmonary edema, although the differential diagnosis does include pneumonia. 
Nasogastric tube with the proximal side port at the GE junction.  The nasogastric tube should be advanced."
"AP CHEST, 2:23 A.M., [**6-12**]. 
HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and pleural effusions. 
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**6-10**] through 5: 
Pulmonary edema has cleared from the left lung and small left pleural effusion has decreased.  Marked right lower lobe volume loss is attributable to extrinsic compression by the gigantic right atrium, which also contributes to persistent right pleural effusion.  There is no reason to suspect a hilar mass, but because of mammoth right atrial enlargement it could be due to tricuspid regurgitation and/or Ebstein anomaly.  ET tube and right jugular line are in standard placements and a nasogastric tube ends in the upper stomach."
"CHEST 
HISTORY:  Removal of left chest tube.  Evaluate for pneumothorax. 
One view.  Comparison with the previous study done [**2165-8-18**].  There is interval improvement in pulmonary vascular congestion.  An ill-defined area of increased density in the upper right lung may represent focal consolidation. There is increased density in the retrocardiac area consistent with atelectasis or consolidation, unchanged.  In addition, there is pleural thickening and/or fluid on the left, as before.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Mediastinal structures are unchanged. 
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumothorax post-chest tube removal.  Interval improvement in pulmonary vascular congestion.  Atelectasis or consolidation at the left base.  Pleural thickening and/or fluid on the left.  Focal area of increased density in the upper right lung which may represent asymmetric edema or developing focal consolidation."

The right kidney measures 9.2 cm and shows cortical thinning but no hydronephrosis.  The left kidney is only partially seen but it too shows no evidence of hydronephrosis. 
The spleen is not enlarged.  The bowel is predominantly pulled posteriorly suggesting that the cause of the ascites is intra-abdominal spread of malignancy.Neither pancreas or aorta could be seen. 
IMPRESSION:  Pancreas and aorta not seen. Extensive ascites that is probably malignant."
"INDICATION:  Bilateral rib fractures and pleural effusions, now with failure. 
PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST:  The right lateral hemithorax is not included on this study.  There is increasing haziness to the lung fields consistent with increasing and now moderate to moderately large bilateral pleural effusions. Pulmonary vasculature is difficult to evaluate but does appear to be somewhat increased with some haziness to the vasculature suggesting at least early interstitial edema.  Heart size is at least moderately increased.  Overall, there appears to be some increasing haziness to the lung fields but comparison between the prior upright and this supine study is somewhat limited.

STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph. 
COMPARISON:  [**2167-6-23**]. 
FINDINGS:  The heart size is within normal limits.  Mediastinal width is likely exaggerated by the patient's rotation to the right as well as an unfolded aorta.  A lucency projecting over the lower mediastinum is most consistent with a hiatal hernia.  The hila are normal appearing bilaterally. There is no large lobar consolidation; the right lower lung shows improved aeration.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The osseous structures are intact.

There is again evidence of airly marked left ventricular enlargement of the heart, associated with upper zone redistribution and blurring of vascular detail at the bases.  The costophrenic angles remain sharp.  The findings are consistent with moderate left ventricular decompensation.  The large rounded calcific density is again noted in th e right upper quadrant, consistent with a biliary calculus. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Satisfactory placement of NG line. 2.  Marked LV enlargement associated with slight LV decompensation."
"HISTORY:  79-year-old female status post intubation, to assess the position of the ET tube. 
TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP radiograph of the chest was performed. Comparison is made with radiograph of [**2132-9-28**] done at 3:24 p.m. 
FINDINGS: 
The ET tube has its tip approximately 39 mm from the carina.  The tip of the NG tube is projected over the stomach.  The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  The lung volumes are low, most likely due to poor inspiratory effort.  There is perihilar haze bilaterally suggestive of pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is an area of added density in the right mid zone, suggesting superimposed infection. 
CONCLUSION: 
Overall, findings are suggestive of mild CHF and possible superimposed infection versus confluent edema in the right mid zone.  Slight improved aeration.  Please follow up to clearance."
"INDICATION:  55-year-old male status post intubation at outside hospital. Recent central line placement.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.

"CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON [**2181-10-15**] 
COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from [**2181-9-20**] and CT from [**2181-9-8**]. 
CLINICAL HISTORY:  Low-grade fever, weakness, on chemotherapy, question pneumonia. 
FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Port noted over the right chest wall with catheter tip extending to the low SVC.  Linear plate-like atelectasis is seen within the lower lung.  While the appearance is more suggestive of atelectasis, the possibility of a subtle pneumonia would be impossible to excluded.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart and mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  Bony structures are intact.  Vascular stents are seen in the upper abdomen seen on the lateral projection. 
IMPRESSION:  Plate-like atelectasis in the lower lungs, cannot excluded a subtle pneumonia.                                                                       SESHa"

INDICATION:  Bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
COMPARISON:  CT head dated [**2175-7-15**] and [**2175-7-17**]. 
TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT. 
FINDINGS:  There is continued interval decreased conspicuity of the previously identified bilateral areas of subarachnoid hemorrhage.  No new areas of intracranial hemorrhage are identified.  Minimal, if any, leftward shift of midline structures remains.  The ventricles, sulci, and cisterns are stable in appearance.  The appearance of the brain parenchyma is unchanged.  Small left scalp hematoma continues to resolve.  The visualized paranasal sinuses and osseous structures are stable. 
IMPRESSION:  Continued decreased conspicuity of bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage with no new areas of hemorrhage or mass effect identified. 
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There is no evidence of midline shift. There is no evidence of mass effect."
"CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST [**2198-1-11**] 
HISTORY:  Acute on chronic subdural hematoma. 
Contiguous axial images were obtained through the brain.  No contrast was administered.  Comparison to a head CT of [**2198-1-10**]. 
FINDINGS:  The overall size of the subdural hematoma appears unchanged.  It has changed density in that the fluid-fluid level detected on the previous study is no longer identified, instead, there appears to be a more uniform distribution of density throughout the collection.  There continues to be mild left to right midline shift and subfalcine herniation.  There is no evidence of new hemorrhage. 
CONCLUSION:  No evidence of enlargement of the subdural hematoma since [**2198-1-10**].  The density appears more uniform than on the prior study."

"PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON [**11-18**] 
HISTORY:  Non-small cell carcinoma, following debridement. 
IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to [**11-16**] and 4: 
The substantial improvement in aeration of the still small left lung achieved between [**11-16**] and [**11-17**] has been maintained.  Left hemidiaphragm is still elevated.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are still present. Vascular congestion in the right lung has worsened since [**11-16**].  The heart is normal size.  Small irregular opacities in the right lung and diffuse interstitial infiltration in the left lung are presumably due to widespread malignancy, the bulk of which is in a left hilar mass."
"INDICATION:  New PICC, assess for PICC location. 
TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright radiograph of the chest. 
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from [**2150-12-26**]. 
FINDINGS:  Right internal jugular catheter has been removed, and right PICC has been placed.  Distal tip is not well seen due to overlap of pacer and pacer defibrillator wires.  Median sternotomy wires noted.  Lung volumes are decreased with mild pulmonary vascular congestion but no focal consolidation. There is a small right pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.  Heart is top normal in size with normal cardiomediastinal silhouette. 
IMPRESSION:  Right PICC tip not well seen.  Further assessment by shallow obliques is recommended. Trace right pleural effusion. 
These findings were discussed with [**Doctor Last Name **] of IV nursing by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 948**] by telephone at 09:45 on [**2150-12-29**]."

"N-G TUBE PLACEMENT UNDER FLUOROSCOPIC GUIDANCE: 
INDICATION:  78 year old male s/p AAA repair.  Needs post pyloric tube for nutrition. 
FINDINGS:  Using fluoroscopic guidance, multiple attempts were made at passing an NGT into the esophagus and stomach.  Due to difficulties of passage related to the patient's tracheostomy balloon cuff, a J-tip stiff Amplatz guidewire was used with an 8 French [**Location (un) 1112**]-[**Doctor First Name 1113**] nasogastric tube. 
The tube was successfully passed into the stomach, through the pylorus, and into position at the Ligament of Treitz.  5 cc of Conray contrast were injected to confirm tube placement.  There were no complications.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 5983**] [**Name (STitle) 2592**] was present and supervised the procedure. 
IMPRESSION:  Successful post pyloric placement of NGT."
"TWO VIEW CHEST, [**2189-2-24**]: Compared to previous study of earlier the same date. 
CLINICAL INDICATION:  S/P thoracentesis. 
There has been interval decrease in size of left pleural effusion.  There is a moderate-sized left pneumothorax present, which is most prominent at the left lung base. An associated fluid level is consistent with a hydropneumothorax. No pneumothorax is seen on the right side.  There is no significant right pleural effusion. 
The cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  There is partial collapse of the left lower lobe and there is discoid atelectasis at the right lung base. 
IMPRESSION:  Decreased left pleural effusion following thoracentesis, but development of moderate-sized pneumothorax."
"HISTORY:  29-year-old female with lupus status post nephrectomies with mitral valve vegetation seen on echocardiogram now with concern for DVT. 
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND:  [**Doctor Last Name 222**]-scale, color, and pulse Doppler son[**Name (NI) 424**] of the bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were performed.  Evaluation of the right common femoral vein was not possible due to presence of an overlying dressing in the right groin.  The remainder of the vessels demonstrate normal compressibility, augmentation, waveform, and color flow without intraluminal echogenic material identified. 
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of DVT in the bilateral lower extremities. Visualization of the right common femoral vein obscured by presence of an overlying dressing."
"INDICATION: 21 year old female status post C-section one week ago. Now presenting with fever and shortness of breath. 
COMPARISONS: No comparisons are available. 
AP UPRIGHT SINGLE VIEW OF THE CHEST: Study is slightly limited by overlying bra. The cardiac silhouette appears to be enlarged but this may be partially due to the low respiratory volumes. There is mild upper zone redistribution and perihilar haziness. There are bibasilar atelectases and bilateral pleural effusions. These findings are probably related to pulmonary vascular congestion. Cannot rule out an underlying infection. 
IMPRESSION: 1. Pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions. 
2. Suggestion of  patchy opacities throughout the lung fields. Cannot rule out an underlying infection."
"HISTORY:  34-year-old male with alcohol ingestion and pneumomediastinum on the outside hospital CT, to assess for degree of pneumomediastinum. 
TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP radiograph of the chest was performed.  The outside chest CT is not available for comparison at the time of dictation. 
FINDINGS: 
There is gas present in the subcutaneous tissues of the neck.  There is a faint suggestion of pneumomediastinum over the left heart border.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette otherwise appears unremarkable.  There is no pneumothorax or focal pulmonary consolidation. 
CONCLUSION: 
The outside chest CT demonstrating pneumomediastinum is not available for comparison at the time of reporting.  Within these limitations there is gas present in the subcutaneous tissues of the neck.  There is a faint linear lucency over the left heart border suggestive of pneumomediastinum.  The lungs are clear."
"INDICATION:  Stroke, status post intubation, evaluate ET tube placement. 
COMPARISON:  [**2110-10-15**]. 
TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable supine chest. 
FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is in place with tip terminating 3.6 cm from the carina.  There is stable cardiomegaly.  The aorta is unfolded and prominently calcified.  There is diffuse hazy opacity over the lung fields bilaterally, suggestive of layering bilateral pleural effusions.  In addition, there is slight prominence of the pulmonary vasculature and scattered peripheral septal lines consistent with mild congestive heart failure.  No focal areas of pulmonary parenchymal consolidation or air bronchograms are identified.  No pneumothorax.  The osseous structures demonstrate osteopenia. 
IMPRESSION: 1)  Status post endotracheal intubation.  Endotracheal tube in satisfactory position. 2)  Cardiomegaly, layering bilateral pleural effusions, and mild congestive heart failure.  No definite evidence of pneumonia, although followup chest x- ray is recommended after treatment to assess resolution."
"AP CHEST AND AP PELVIS, [**2114-10-26**] 
HISTORY:  73-year-old woman, status post fall. 
FINDINGS: 
AP CHEST: There is a large right-sided pleural effusion.  A small left-sided effusion is seen.  An old fracture is seen of the right lateral rib.  No acute rib fractures are seen.  Cardiac silhouette and mediastinum are grossly within normal limits. 
AP PELVIS: The patient is status post bilateral total hip prostheses.  The left-sided prosthesis demonstrates several broken cerclage wires adjacent to the greater trochanter which are unchanged since the [**2112-12-17**] radiograph. There are no signs for hardware complications.  Calcified lesion is seen within the pelvis, likely a calcified fibroid.  Degenerative changes are seen in the lower lumbar spine. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Right-sided pleural effusion which is moderate without acute bony injury seen. 2.  No signs for acute bony injury to the pelvis."
"INDICATION:  68-year-old male status post left thoracotomy and decortication. Evaluate chest tubes. 
Single AP chest radiograph compared to [**2178-5-25**] shows placement of two apical and one basal chest tubes on the left.  There is a tiny left-sided apical pneumothorax and small loculated air collection around the tip of the basal chest tube.  Moderate left chest wall subcutaneous emphysema is present. New left apical and basilar opacities likely represent a combination of atelectasis and post- procedural change. Bilateral pleural effusion persists, small on the left and moderate on the right. The cardiomediastinal contour is stable. ET tube terminates 3.2 cm above the carina. 
IMPRESSION: Tiny left apical pneumothorax."
"CLINICAL INDICATION:  Status post aortic valve replacement, rule out tamponade. 
AP supine portable chest radiograph date [**2192-11-2**] is compared to PA and lateral chest radiograph dated [**2192-10-29**].  The heart size has not increased markedly compared to prior study.  There are bilateral hazy opacities in the bases and effusions cannot be excluded.  There is motion limiting the resolution of the film.  The ET tube is in appropriate position.  A Swan-Ganz catheter terminates just about at the main pulmonary artery.  An NG tube is identified but cannot be followed coursing below the diaphragm due to technique. 
IMPRESSION: 
1) No obvious change in the heart size to indicate tamponade, however, clinical correlation is required. 
2) Lines and tubes positioned as above. 
3) Motion on film limits evaluation of lung parenchyma."
"INDICATION:  Multifocal pneumonia, now with increasing O2 requirements. 
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from [**2129-12-11**]. 
FINDINGS:  A single upright portable chest radiograph was obtained.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are normal.  There is increasing opacification of the right lower lobe, consistent with worsening pneumonia. In the course of reviewing prior imaging, a lesion was identified at the apex of the right lung that could be a nodule or may be secondary to an infectious process.  There is a small right effusion.  Surgical clips are seen over the left hemithorax. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Worsening right lower lobe pneumonia. 2.  Right apical nodule or infection.  Followup of this lesion is recommended. 3.  Small right pleural effusion."
"CLINICAL INDICATION:  Intermittent abdominal pain and nausea. 
There is a relative paucity of bowel gas within the abdomen.  A small amount of non distended air filled colon is noted.  Soft tissue interfaces of the psoas margins are preserved.  There is some prominence of the splenic contour projecting just below the 12th left posterior rib.  The hepatic contour is normal in appearance. 
Degenerative changes are observed within the spine. 
IMPRESSION:  Non obstructed bowel gas pattern.  Relatively paucity of gas within the colon. 
The hemidiaphragms were not included on the radiograph, precluding assessment for free intraperitoneal air.  If there is clinical suspicion for free air, additional upright chest radiograph or left lateral decubitus abdominal view would be recommended."
"INDICATION:  Left PICC positioning. 
COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from [**2126-7-22**]. 
FINDINGS:  A beside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates a new left PICC terminating within the mid portion of the superior vena cava.  Aside from trace left lower lobe atelectasis, the lungs are clear and the hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion and the pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Old right posterior 8th and 9th rib fractures are noted. 
IMPRESSION:  New left PICC terminates in the mid SVC.  Otherwise normal study. 
NOTE:  Findings were communicated to [**Doctor First Name 2182**], the PICC nurse, by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 67**] via telephone on [**2126-7-25**] at 9:15 a.m."
"EXAM:  Portable AP chest [**2135-7-14**].

FINDINGS:  Comparison made to [**2135-1-10**]. 
Enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, with evidence of prior median sternotomy and CABG.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Lungs are clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is a thin rim of lucency beneath the right hemidiaphragm which is nondiagnostic but could potentially represent free intraperitoneal air. 
IMPRESSION:  Possible free intraperitoneal air.  Further evaluation with abdominal left lateral decubitus abdominal radiograph is recommended.  If these are inconclusive, CT could be performed for further evaluation. 
Findings were discussed via telephone with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at 14:15 on [**2135-7-14**]."
"PORTABLE CHEST DATED [**2137-4-15**] 
INDICATION:  Worsening fever. 
Tracheostomy tube and left subclavian vascular catheter remain in standard position.  There has been placement of a right subclavian catheter, which terminates near the expected location of the junction of the superior vena cava and right atrium.  The lung volumes are low.  Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, and there is vascular engorgement and bilateral perihilar haziness.  Additionally, there is a worsening asymmetrical alveolar process throughout the left lung.  Right basilar alveolar opacities are unchanged. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Worsening diffuse alveolar opacities in the left lung and persistent right basilar consolidation.  These findings are likely due to an evolving pneumonia. 2.  Mild perihilar haziness, which may reflect co-existing pulmonary edema from fluid overload."
"HISTORY:  Status post removal of right subclavian line. 
CHEST AP PORTABLE:  Comparison is made to the prior study obtained on [**2117-12-8**].  Again noted is a tracheostomy tube in place.  The left IJ central line appears to terminate in the SVC.  There is removal of left subclavian line.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Again noted is mild pulmonary edema, with consolidation in the right lower lobe and the left lung base, not significantly changed from the prior study.  The heart is of normal size. Also noted are possible bilateral pleural effusion, right slightly greater than left, with associated atelectasis. 
IMPRESSION:  There is interval removal of left-sided subclavian central line. No evidence of pneumothorax.  Bilateral pleural effusion, with associated atelectasis."
"INDICATION:  Status post type A dissection repair.  Evaluate for pneumothorax. 
COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph [**2136-2-1**].  Chest radiograph [**2136-1-31**]. 
FINDINGS:  The large bore right internal jugular central catheter has been exchanged for a smaller central venous catheter.  The tip ends in the low SVC. Mild pulmonary edema has slightly worsened with an increase in size of the left pleural effusion.  The right pleural effusion is stable.  There is no new consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax.  The enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable with a normal postoperative appearance.  Sternal wires are intact. 
IMPRESSION: 1)  New right internal jugular central venous catheter ends in the low SVC. No pneumothorax. 2)  Slightly worse mild pulmonary edema with an increase in size of a moderate left pleural effusion."
"INDICATION:  History of myocardial infarction, CHF, pneumonia, extubated. Please evaluate nasogastric tube placement.

The side hole of the nasogastric tube is above the gastroesophageal junction.  The heart size is stable.  Again seen are coarse bilateral confluent airspace infiltrates with air bronchograms.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
IMPRESSION:  Malpositioned nasogastric tube with the sidehole above the gastroesophageal junction. 
COMMENT: These findings were communicated to the clinical team caring for the patient at 9:00 p.m. on [**2198-3-5**] with the instructions to advance the nasogastric tube approximately 10 cm.  Unchanged diffuse bilateral confluent infiltrates."
"PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY 
INDICATION:  Patient with AFib with rvr.  Evaluation for proper line placement.  The patient has myelodisplasia here for transplant. 
COMPARISON:  [**2191-6-6**]. 
FINDINGS: 
Left subclavian line ends in upper SVC and right subclavian line ends at the lower SVC.  There is no pneumothorax. 
Bilateral lower lung consolidation are new.  Left small pleural effusion is also new if any.  Mediastinal and cardiac contour are within normal limits. There is no pneumothorax. 
CONCLUSION: 
1.  New subclavian lines are in adequate position. 2.  New bibasilar opacities are compatible with an infectious process.  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2337**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] has been verbally contact[**Name (NI) **] for the results."
"INDICATION:  Intracranial hemorrhage status post intubation, evaluate endotracheal tube position. 
TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable supine chest. 
FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is in place with tip terminating approximately 4.3 cm from the carina.  A nasogastric tube extends below the diaphragm with tip terminating below the borders of the radiograph.  The heart size and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Slight prominence of the upper zone pulmonary vasculature likely relates to supine positioning.  There is bibasilar linear opacity consistent with atelectasis, and more dense opacity in the left retrocardiac region with obscuration of the medial aspect of the left hemidiaphragm.  No pneumothorax.  The osseous structures appear unremarkable.

CLINICAL INDICATION:  A 27-year-old with feeding tube placement, check location. 
Comparison to prior study of [**2160-11-16**] at 10:35. 
Portable AP chest film dated [**2160-11-16**] at 11:14 is submitted. 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  The Dobbhoff feeding tube is now coiled within the distal esophagus with the tip positioned in the mid esophagus.  Repositioning is advised.  The patient's nurse, [**Doctor First Name **], was notified of the need for repositioning at 11:50 a.m.  Tracheostomy tube remains in satisfactory position. 
2.  Lung volumes remain low.  Retrocardiac opacity with associated air bronchograms is stable and may reflect partial lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded.  No evidence of pulmonary edema or pleural effusions.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable given portable technique and differences in positioning between studies."
"INDICATION:  Aspiration pneumonitis, evaluate for interval change. 
PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH. 
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, [**2149-2-2**]. 
FINDINGS:  A nasogastric tube courses through the esophagus into the stomach. There remains a large hiatal hernia, which is no longer gas-filled.  Lung volumes are lower than on the previous examination.  There is suggestion of a new opacity in the right upper lung.  Aeration at the right base; however, appears somewhat better compared to the earlier examination.  Prominence of the pulmonary vasculature may be somewhat due to edema, but also reflective of low lung volumes.  Heart size appears stable allowing for lower lung volumes. There is no pneumothorax. 
IMPRESSION: 
Lower lung volumes with possible worsening area of consolidation in the right upper lobe, but improved aeration at the right base."
"HISTORY:  65-year-old male with intraventricular/intraparenchymal hemorrhage. 
COMPARISON:  Head CT without IV contrast from three days prior. 
TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained from the cranial vertex to the foramen magnum without IV contrast. 
HEAD CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is no significant change in appearance of left caudate hemorrhage and related extensive intraventricular hemorrhage. There has been interval resorption of the right frontal parafalcine subarachnoid hemorrhage, with a tiny residual focus remaining.  No new hemorrhage or mass effect is identified.  There is no shift of normally midline structures, or evidence of vascular territorial infarction. 
IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of left caudate hemorrhage and extensive intraventricular hemorrhage."
"HISTORY:  44 year old man status post trauma. 
CT OF HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: 
Comparison made to prior scan from outside hospital. 
There is subcutaneous gas in the left infraorbital region, increased from the prior outside hospital scan, and increased gas in the left orbit.  There is also increased air in the right orbit.  The left sphenoid sinus is now opacified (vs. previously seen air-fluid level), which is consistent with a basilar skull fracture. 
The anterior and posterior wall of the left frontal sinus is also fractured. 
There is a linear occipital fracture on the left extending from the foramen magnum to the lambda.  No subdural hematoma is identified. 
IMPRESSION: 
1) Increased pneumocephalus, as described above. 
2) Fracture through the left frontal sinus. 
3) Left linear occipital fracture.  No subdural hematoma."

IMPRESSION: 1.  New right PICC terminating in region of superior cavoatrial junction.  No pneumothorax. 2.  Unchanged mild cardiomegaly, retrocardiac atelectasis, vascular congestion, mild bilateral pulmonary edema, and small pleural effusions."
"REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of internal jugular line placement. 
Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**2145-8-11**] obtained at 01:57 a.m. The right internal jugular line was inserted in the meantime interval with its tip in the more superior portion of the SVC.  There is no pneumothorax, apical hematoma, or pleural effusion. The heart size is markedly enlarged with markedly increased bilateral perihilar opacities suggesting worsening of pulmonary edema especially giving the rapid development.  There is no sizable right pleural effusion, but left pleural effusion cannot be excluded giving the absence of imaging of the left costophrenic angle. 
IMPRESSION:  New pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax after insertion of satisfactory position right internal jugular line."
"EXAMINATION:  AP chest. 
INDICATION:  Fever, increasing white count. 
Single AP view of the chest is obtained on [**2182-8-2**] at 16:10 hours and is compared with prior radiograph performed on [**2182-5-8**].  The heart is not enlarged.  There is evidence of prior cardiac surgery.  The lung fields show a patchy opacity at the left base, likely in the left lower lobe. Unfortunately, the left lateral portion of the lower chest is not included fully on the current examination.  No other acute change is noted. 
IMPRESSION: 
Patchy increase in density in the left lower lung field may represent early pneumonia given the patient's history.  Since the examination is suboptimal, I would obtain a PA and lateral views of the chest for confirmation.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70591**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] at 5:05 p.m.  He will order a repeat AP view."
"INDICATION:  Remote renal cell carcinoma with right hemispheric lesion concerning for tumor. 
COMPARISON:  None. 
FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  There is a peripheral opacity within the left upper lobe with linear opacity extending to the hilum.  A nodular opacity overlies the left eighth posterior rib.  There is also mild opacity at the left lung base.  No effusion or pneumothorax is appreciated. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Clips are seen within the upper abdomen. 
IMPRESSION:  Left upper lobe peripheral parenchymal opacity and nodular opacity overlying the left eighth posterior rib.  Given the clinical history, further evaluation with a dedicated chest CT is recommended. 
Findings paged to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3709**] on [**2161-6-14**] at 1:50 p.m."
"HISTORY:  Sepsis and DIC.  Prolonged intubation. Continued fevers, on antibiotics.  Please check for Dobhoff tube placement.

The heart and lungs are unchanged from [**2124-3-7**]. 
IMPRESSION:  Dobhoff tube within the stomach."
"CHEST, TWO VIEWS, [**2177-3-31**] 
HISTORY:  49-year-old male with altered mental status, question pneumonia. 
FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam from [**2177-3-15**]. 
The lungs are clear of confluent consolidation.  Costophrenic angles are sharp.  As on prior, there is a calcified density projecting over the anterior right first rib for which apical lordotic views could help further localize within the chest versus within the rib.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable. Multiple air-fluid levels identified in the upper abdomen without free intraperitoneal air. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  No acute intracranial process. 2.  Calcific density projecting over the right third rib for which apical lordotic views may help further characterize. 3.  Multiple air-fluid levels identified below the diaphragm for which clinical correlation is recommended and additional imaging if clinically desired."
"INDICATION:  Pneumothorax. 
COMPARISON:  [**2180-3-25**], and [**2180-3-24**]. 
FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
Accounting for differences in technique, the moderately large right apical pneumothorax is not significantly changed, however the basilar component has moderately increased in size.  The chest tube may have been slightly withdrawn as it now lies at the level of the right sixth posterior rib at the site of prior thoracotomy as opposed to the fifth rib as previously noted.  Opacity at the left lung apex represents known small loculated hydropneumothorax.  Left PICC line is unchanged.  Bibasilar reticular opacities reflect chronic interstitial lung disease and are stable. 
IMPRESSION:  Increasing moderately large right-sided pneumothorax. 
Findings discussed with [**Doctor First Name **] Bardia on [**2180-3-26**], at 11:30 a.m."

"AP CHEST, 11:27 A.M. [**11-30**] 
HISTORY:  Newly placed chest tube. 
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**11-30**] at 4:46 a.m.: 
Following insertion of a left apical pleural tube left pleural effusion has resolved and there is no pneumothorax.  Lung volumes are generally improved, but there is greater consolidation at the right lung base either atelectasis or new pneumonia.  The left basal atelectasis has decreased.  Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  There is no appreciable pneumothorax. Displacement of right fourth rib fracture has increased compared to prior studies.  Clinical correlation advised. 
Right apical drain is still in place. Right jugular line ends in the mid SVC. Tracheostomy tube in standard placement.  There is probably a small volume of right pleural air medially located against the right atrial border."
"PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST OF [**2136-6-24**]. 
INDICATION:  Fever. 
Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size.  Right-sided vascular stents are present, with narrowing of the right brachiocephalic stent.  Air is present within the proximal thoracic esophagus adjacent to the proximal intrathoracic trachea extending to the carina.  Lungs are clear, there are no pleural effusions evident on this single projection. 
COMPARISON:  Scout image from a CT scan of [**2134-2-18**] has become available for comparison.  As compared to that study, there has not been a substantial change in the appearance of the lungs allowing for technical differences between the exams. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Cardiomegaly.  No evidence of pneumonia. 2.  Air within intrathoracic esophagus, a nonspecific finding that can be associated with esophageal dysmotility."
"STUDY:  CT head without contrast. 
INDICATION:  55-year-old male with trauma and fall. 
FINDINGS:  This study is limited secondary to motion artifact.  However, no definite evidence of hemorrhage, mass lesion, shift of normally midline structures, hydrocephalus or evidence of major territorial infarct is apparent.  The major intracranial cisterns are preserved. 
No definite fractures are detected.  Within the left maxillary sinus there is lobular mucosal thickening and a small air fluid level.  No abnormalities are detected within the orbits.

The major vessels appear patent proximally. There are stable areas of low signal in the left frontal and right occipetal/temporal lobes. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Interval resolution of previously noted posterior white matter abnormalities. 2.  Stable prior areas of hemorrhage within the left frontal and right occipital/temporal regions. 3.  Very limited MRA as above."
"INDICATION:  History of fever, evaluate for infiltrate. 
PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY:  No previous studies are available for comparison. Cardiomegaly with left ventricular enlargement is noted.  Study is limited by technique and body habitus, but there appears to be mild prominence of the vascular with some degree of mild CHF.  The superior mediastinum appears slightly widened, which is likely related to prominence of the vascular structures in that area and an ectatic aorta. A small rounded opacity is noted at the right cardiophrenic angle of uncertain etiology, without evaluation with a lateral chest x-ray.  Osseous structures are normal.  No pleural effusions or pneumothoraces are seen. 
IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly with mild CHF.  No evidence of pneumonia.  Further evluation with proper PA & lateral chest x-ray can be obtained of clinically indicated."
"INDICATION:  Gunshot wound, exploratory laparotomy, bilateral chest tubes, and spinal fusion.

IMPRESSION:  Two AP supine views of the abdomen show air and contrast [**Doctor Last Name 1511**] in a dilated segment of small bowel in the right lower abdominal quadrant appearing to  terminate in a larger collection of barium in the right abdomen where one would expect the transverse colon.  The remainder of the abdomen is relatively gasless.  At very least upright studies are needed to outline loops of bowel and determine the extent of distention.  It may be necessary to do either a fistulogram or a contrast study per rectum to delineate the anatomy. One cannot exclude free intraperitoneal air on supine views alone.  The enterostomy tube projects over the left upper quadrant, probably a gastrostomy."

"There are no prior studies available for comparison. 
TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast head CT. 
FINDINGS:  There is no intraparenchymal or extra-axial hemorrhage.  There is no shift of normally midline structures, mass effect or hydrocephalus.  The density values of the brain parenchyma are within normal limits.  Symmetric high attenuation is demonstrated within the vascular structures, which is within normal limits in neonatal age due to a hematocrit effect and fetal hemoglobin.  Soft tissue swelling is noted overlying the vertex most consistent with molding secondary to the vaginal delivery.  There is also slight overlap of the sutures within normal limits.  There are no fractures identified. 
IMPRESSION:  No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect."
"REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Increased cough and fever, repositioning of the right internal jugular line. 
Portable AP chest radiograph compared to previous film done the same date earlier at 15:20 p.m. 
The right internal jugular line tip now is projected at the level of the cavoatrial junction being pushed down for at least 6.6 cm.  There is worsening of bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary edema with additional decrease in the lung volumes.  The heart size is enlarged but unchanged.  There is no evidence of discrete pulmonary masses. 
IMPRESSION: 
1)  Standard position of right internal jugular line. 
2)  Worsening of  pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusion."
"TWO VIEW OF THE CHEST: 
Two view of the chest on [**8-30**] are compared to the study on [**7-30**].  The right-sided catheter is in place, tip in the superior vena cava, unchanged. There are old deformities of the right fifth, sixth, seventh, and eight ribs posteriorly.  The right lung is clear of any active infiltrate. There is bilateral apical pleural thickening and the old changes in the left upper lobe, thought to represent scarring, and there appears to be atelectasis or scarring in the lingula abutting the left cardiac margin.  This appeared to be present on old CT studies.  No obvious effusions are present. 
CONCLUSION:  Chronic changes as described.  No acute abnormality recognized. If desired to evaluate the changes in the lingula adjacent to the left heart border, a repeat CT study would be helpful."
"INDICATIONS:  NASH/schistosomiasis with cirrhosis with prior TIPS.  Assess TIPS patency. 
DOPPLER LIVER ULTRASOUND:  There is a persistent large amount of ascites in the upper abdomen similar to on the [**2192-9-17**] study.  The TIPS is redemonstrated and demonstrates wall-to-wall color flow.  Velocities ranged from 27 cm/sec proximally, 52 cm/sec mid, to 78 cm/sec distally.  Flow rates have decreased since the prior study, particularly in the distal aspect of the stent. Flow velocity within the main portal vein is 35 cm/second.  Study was limited due to large body habitus. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Persistent large amount of ascites surrounding liver. 2. Decrease in TIPS velocities.  Peak velocity in the distal TIPS currently 78 cm/sec (previously 120 cm/sec)."

IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**7-19**]. 
Since [**7-19**], a new right PIC line has been inserted, tip traceable to the low SVC, beyond which the catheter may extend to the anticipated location of the superior cavoatrial junction.  Mild-to-moderate interstitial pulmonary edema has worsened since [**7-19**] and coalescent edema may account for right infrahilar opacification, though followup is advised to exclude developing pneumonia.  Pleural effusion is small on the right, if any.  No pneumothorax. Heart size normal.  Mediastinal vasculature not appreciably engorged."
"HISTORY:  Septic and cardiogenic shock. 
COMPARISON:  [**2179-6-5**].

"INDICATION:  Painful swelling of left neck, left facial nerve palsy. 
There are no comparison studies available. 
TECHNIQUE:  CT OF THE NECK WITH CONTRAST. 
FINDINGS:  There is no soft tissue swelling apparent on CT examination.  The bilateral parotid glands have a higher density than omral, which is a nonspecific finding.  There are no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes seen. Limited views of the brain and lungs demonstrate no abnormalities.  There is evidence of a prior sternotomy with sternal wires present.  There are degenerative changes in the C6/7 vertebrae. The osseous structures are otherwise unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION:  Increased density of bilateral parotid glands, which is a nonspecific finding.  There is no pathologic adenopathy noted."
"HISTORY:  Treated pneumonia. 
One view.  Comparison with [**2183-9-2**].  There is an ill-defined area of increased density in the left infrahilar region which may represent consolidation or fibrotic scarring.  There is minimal streaky density on the right consistent with subsegmental atelectasis or scarring.  The patient is status post median sternotomy.  The heart is normal in size and mediastinal structures are otherwise unremarkable and appears stable.  The bony thorax is grossly intact. Compared with the earlier study the distribution of increased density on the lower left lung appears to have changed somewhat. 
IMPRESSION:  Ill-defined increased density in the left infrahilar region which may represent parenchymal consolidation.  PA and lateral views are recommended for further evaluation."

IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**2168-11-6**] and [**2168-11-7**] at 4:31 p.m.: 
Previous large right pleural effusion has almost resolved suggesting resorption of extravasation rather than hemothorax, which would be expected to clear less quickly.  There is no pneumothorax or mediastinal widening.  Right subclavian line and left transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are in their expected locations, tracheostomy tube is in standard placement and a nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view. There is no pneumothorax or mediastinal widening.  Heart is normal size. Large pulmonary arteries suggest pulmonary arterial hypertension."
"CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE. 
REASON:  Patient status post carotid endarterectomy for follow-up. 
FINDINGS:  Duplex evaluation was performed of both carotid arteries. Significant plaque was identified on the left.  A large area of what appears to be a patch is noted in the right carotid artery. 
On the right peak systolic velocities are 82, 76, 131 in the ICA, CCA, ECA respectively.  The ICA to CCA ratio is 1.  This is consistent with no stenosis. 
On the left peak systolic velocities are 197, 68, 106 in the ICA, CCA, ECA respectively.  The ICA to CCA ratio is 2.8.  This is consistent with a 60 to 69% stenosis. 
There is antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries. 
IMPRESSION:  Significant left-sided plaque with a 60 to 69% carotid stenosis. On the right there is no evidence of stenosis status post endarterectomy."
"INDICATION: Pre-evaluation of counterpulsion.  Evaluate for abdominal aortic aneurysm. 
ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND: The liver demonstrates normal echotexture without focal mass.  There is no intra or extrahepatic ductal dilatation. The gallbladder is normal without evidence of stones.  The portal vein demonstrates normal hepatopetal flow.  There is no hydronephrosis.  The right kidney measures 11.4 cm. The left kidney measures 11.3 cm.  Within the mid portion of the right kidney, there is a 1.5 cm anechoic cyst with a thin septation.  Within the upper pole of the left kidney, there is a 1 cm simple cyst.  The pancreas is not well visualized.  The spleen is not remarkable. The aorta is of normal caliber throughout. 
IMPRESSION:  Normal caliber aorta.  Bilateral renal cysts."
"CHEST, 10:52 P.M. ON [**8-1**] 
CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Increasing oxygen requirement.  OG tube placement. 
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**7-30**] and 12:37 on [**8-1**]: 
Endotracheal tube tip at the carina should be withdrawn 4 cm for standard placement.  OG tube passes into the stomach and out of view.  Left lower lobe collapse and small left pleural effusion unchanged.  Moderate cardiomegaly may have improved slightly.  Pulmonary vascular congestion has improved and pulmonary edema has resolved.  Right apical pleural thickening is longstanding.  Thoracic aorta is generally enlarged, but not acutely changed. No pneumothorax. 
Findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2579**] by telephone at the time of dictation."
"EXAM:  Abdomen obtained [**2161-9-11**]. 
HISTORY:  Status post lung resection with nausea and vomiting, rule out postoperative ileus. 
TECHNIQUE:  AP supine and left lateral decubitus views of the abdomen were obtained. 
FINDINGS: 
Air is identified within non-dilated loops of bowel throughout the abdomen and pelvis.  No suspicious air-fluid levels are identified on the decubitus view. No free intraperitoneal air.  No suspicious calcifications within the abdomen or pelvis. 
There is a significant amount of stool noted throughout the colon. 
Degenerative changes of the lower lumbar spine are noted. 
The distal tip of a chest tube is noted overlying the upper aspect of the film on the right side. 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Non-obstructive bowel gas pattern with a significant amount of stool noted throughout the colon."
"HISTORY:  COPD.  Assess PTX. 
AP bedside chest done supine.  Multiple tubes and catheters, including left chest tube, are unchanged in position since examination 1 day previous.  Heart normal size without vascular congestion or consolidations.  No demonstrable PTX or effusion although these assessments are suboptima due to recumbent positioning.  Allowing for differences in positioning there is little change from semi-erect exam 1 day previous which suggest small PTX on left. 
IMPRESSION:  No demonstrable short interval change.  No pneumonia or CHF. No PTX identified."
"STUDY:  Unilateral lower extremity venous ultrasound right. 
INDICATION:  69-year-old female with COPD exacerbation and right knee and calf pain.  Assess for DVT,  [**Hospital Ward Name 3084**] cyst. 
COMPARISONS:  [**2139-2-15**]. 
FINDINGS:  [**Doctor Last Name 222**] scale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 424**] of the right common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins are performed.  Normal flow, augmentation and compressibility is demonstrated.  Intraluminal thrombus is not identified.  Evaluation son[**Name (NI) 4768**] posterior to the knee demonstrates no [**Hospital Ward Name 3084**] cyst. 
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of DVT in the right lower extremity.  No [**Hospital Ward Name 3084**] cyst."
"Doppler evaluation was performed at rest and exercise. Exercise consists of toe- ups for three minutes. The patient stopped due to pain after three minutes. 
On the right, Doppler tracings are triphasic at all levels from the femoral to the posterior tibial level.  Ankle brachial index is 0.93.  With limited exercise, the ABI drops 0.49 and does not completely recover.  At rest, pulse volume recordings are normal. 
Most Doppler tracings are triphasic at all levels from the femoral to the dorsalis pedis artery.  The ankle brachial index is 0.98.  With exercise, it decreases to 0.79 and the waveform becomes monophasic at the common femoral artery at rest.  At rest, pulse volume recordings are normal. 
IMPRESSION:  Significant aortobiiliac occlusive disease, right greater than left."
"REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the ET tube position. 
Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**2193-6-24**]. 
The ETT tube is forwarded distally  with its tip lying 1.5 cm above the carina, almost 2 cm low than recommended. The NG tube is in a  good position within the stomach.  The right internal jugular line tip is at the level of the distal superior vena cava. 
The right infrahilar atelectasis is more prominent now with inspissating of the right intermedius bronchus.  The left pleural effusion is small.  No evidence of congestive heart failure is present. 
IMPRESSION: 1) 2 cm too low position of the ET tube. 
2)  Right infrahilar atelectasis. 
3)  Small left pleural effusion."
"HISTORY:  Charcot foot.  Assess possible infection. 
These two exams consist of six radiographs of the left foot and left ankle. There is marked disruption of the normal anatomy with subluxation and fragmentation of several mid tarsal bones.  There is destruction of the first TMT joint, more suggestive of neuropathic process than infection.  There is widening of the ankle joint laterally, although the ankle mortise is relatively well maintained.  Generalized soft tissue swelling with soft tissue irregularity and ulcerations on the plantar surface.  Little change from similar study [**2147-5-18**]. 
IMPRESSION:  No short interval change in extensive neuropathic abnormalities mid foot.  No new area of bone destruction."
"INDICATION:  49-year-old man with history of left nephrectomy, please assess for stones, tumors, or hydronephrosis of the right kidney. 
Comparison is made to the CT of the torso done on [**2118-7-19**]. 
The right kidney measures 10.9 cm.  No stone or hydronephrosis is noted within the right kidney.  No abnormal mass is seen within the right kidney.  Bladder appears normal.  There is 11 cc of postvoid residual.  The prostate gland measures 3.6 x 3.1 x 2.1 cm. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  No stones, tumors, or hydronephrosis noted within the right kidney. Status post left nephrectomy. 
2. No significant postvoid residual is detected."
"INDICATION:  Status post pleural effusion, thoracentesis. 
COMPARISON:  [**2131-5-28**] at 5:49. 
CHEST, AP PORTABLE:  This study is limited by exclusion of the right costophrenic angle.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable in appearance.  The slight pulmonary vascular redistribution and hazy layering opacity in the right lung are stable, consistent with a layering pleural effusion.  There has been a marked interval decrease in the left pleural effusion with a small residual.  Compressive atelectasis is noted in the left lower lobe.  There is no pneumothorax.  The soft tissue and osseous structures are unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION: 
1) Marked interval reduction of the left pleural effusion, with small residual and left lower lobe atelectasis. 
2) Persistent layering right pleural effusion."
"INDICATION:  Status post ileostomy takedown.  Now has fever.  Evaluate for possible pneumothorax or infiltrate. 
FINDINGS:  A single AP semi-recumbent image.  Comparison study taken supine on [**2149-1-19**].  The right-sided chest tube remains in good position.  The left subclavian central line tip is also well positioned in the lower SVC.  The ET tube has been removed.  The heart again shows some LV enlargement. The pulmonary vessels are difficult to evaluate in the patient's supine posture. Blurring of vascular detail at the bases raises the question of left heart failure with pulmonary edema. There is also blunting of the left CP angle, suggesting an associated effusion.  There is no evidence of a pneumothorax. 
IMPRESSION:  Probable slight left heart failure.  No pneumothorax.  The ET tube has been removed."
"HISTORY:  Post-op gastric bypass on ventilator.  Post re-exploration. 
Two semi-erect bedside radiographs are limited by this patient's large size. Prominence of the cardiac silhouette and central pulmonary vasculature may reflect positioning and size with no overt CHF.  Patchy opacities in the left base more consistent with atelectasis than consolidation although early pneumonia not excluded.  Right PIC line is poorly visualized in the SVC with right IJ line tip in the distal right brachiocephalic vein.  I doubt the presence of PTX or layering effusions.  Since exam two days ago ([**2134-7-12**]) the ET and NG tubes have been removed with otherwise no change. 
IMPRESSION:  Suboptimal exam.  No acute process."
"AP CHEST, 6:16 P.M. ON [**2-13**] 
HISTORY:  Right-sided port placement.  Multiple attempts on the left side. 
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2199-10-8**]: 
Lung volumes have improved and there is no longer any pulmonary edema.  There may be a small residual right pleural effusion.  Heart size is normal.  Spinal stabilization hardware in place, but not evaluated by this study.  Tip of the new right subclavian infusion port may be obscured by one of the spinal support rod, but the line passes at least as far as the upper SVC.  There is no pneumothorax on either side or any mediastinal widening to suggest bleeding."
"PROCEDURE:  Chest portable AP view on [**2158-12-26**]. 
COMPARISON:  [**2158-12-25**]. 
HISTORY:  67-year-old man with pulmonary edema and fevers for question of pneumonia status post vancomycin and Lasix evaluation for interval change. 
FINDINGS:  There is persistent bilateral pulmonary edema with mild cardiomegaly.  The costophrenic angles are persistently blunted secondary to the presence of pleural effusion and adjacent bibasilar atelectasis.  There is no new localized airspace disease suspicious for pneumonia. 
The osseous structures demonstrate old healing rib fractures involving the right upper ribs.  No osseous lytic lesions suspicious for malignancy. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Persistent pulmonary edema with no focal airspace disease suspicious for pneumonia. 2.  Small-to-moderate bibasal pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis. 3.  Right IJ catheter distal tip is in the mid portion of the SVC."
"HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST 
INDICATION:  84-year-old woman with head trauma two days ago.  Evaluate for intracranial hemorrhage. 
COMPARISON:  Not available. 
FINDINGS:  There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally midline structures.  The lateral ventricles and sulci are prominent, consistent with age-related involutional change.  There are periventricular white matter hypodensities, consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic change.  There is a 3-mm lacune in the left subinsular region.  Calcifications of the vertebral and carotid arteries.  The surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.  There is no fracture.  The imaged paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated, with the exception of small amount of mucosal thickening in the maxillary sinuses bilaterally. 
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.  No fracture."
"INDICATION:  39-year-old female status post intubation.  Evaluate tube placement. 
COMMENTS:  A single AP supine view of the chest was reviewed and compared with PA and lateral chest radiographs from [**2202-1-29**]. 
TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is seen with its tip located 4 cm above the level of the carina.  The tip of a nasogastric tube terminates in the fundus of the stomach.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Minimal patchy bibasilar atelectasis is identified.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear.  No pleural effusions or pneumothoraces are identified.  The pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits. 
IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube located in a standard position.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Minimal bibasilar atelectasis."
"INDICATION:  Tachycardia. 
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY VEINS:  The right common femoral, deep femoral, and popliteal veins as well as the left common femoral, superficial femoral, and greater saphenous, and popliteal veins all demonstrate normal color flow and Doppler waveform with normal compressibility, augmentation, and respiratory variation.  Within the right superficial femoral vein, there is decreased compressability and color flow images show a small area where wall to wall flow cannot be demonstrated.  While there is no occlusive, acute thrombus in the right superficial femoral veins, a subacute or chronic thrombus is demonstrated which inhibits wall to wall flow in this region. 
IMPRESSION:  No acute deep vein thrombosis.  Likely subacute or chronic thrombus inhibiting wall to wall blood flow within the right superficial femoral vein."
"INDICATION:  54-year-old woman status post minimally invasive esophagectomy. 
COMPARISON:  None. 
BARIUM ESOPHAGOGRAM: 
At the level of the esophago-gastric anastamosis, there is an irregular track of contrast from the left lateral wall concerning for a small leak. the contrast appeared to clear spontaneously, and no large contrast collection in the mediastinum was seen on delayed imaging (though a small amount may not be seen). 
Note is made of right chest drain, mediastinal drain and port-a-cath. Some bibasal atelectasis is also seen. 
The majority of administered contrast passed distally. 
IMPRESSION: Small leak at esophago-gastric anastomosis, possibly contained. 
Findings discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 26624**] at 16:27 on [**2133-10-18**]."
"HISTORY:  40-year-old female with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, now presenting with shortness of breath, to assess for cardiopulmonary process. 
TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP radiograph of the chest was performed. Comparison is made with radiograph of [**2107-11-30**]. 
FINDINGS: 
The lungs are of low volume, most likely due to poor inspiratory effort. There is atelectasis present at both lung bases.  There is no evidence to suggest CHF.  There is no evidence to suggest pulmonary consolidation.  There is a right-sided central line with the tip projected in the right atrium.  Linear hyperdenisty in the spine is consistent with ""rugger jersey"" appearance in renal osteodystrophy. CONCLUSION: 
Low lung volumes, likely due to poor inspiratory effort.  Atelectasis is present at both lung bases.  Stable cardiomegaly with no focal consolidation or CHF."
"INDICATION:  History of cirrhosis with TIPS and thoracentesis performed on [**2131-3-10**] complicated by pneumothorax. 
TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs. 
COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, most recently on [**2131-3-26**]. 
FINDINGS:  The right pneumothorax has resolved.  However, there has been continued increase in the pleural effusion which is now large and leaving only the right upper lobe aerated.  There is no shift of mediastinal structures. There is no focal consolidation. The visualized portions of the cardiomediastinal silhouette are within normal limits. 
IMPRESSION:  Large right pleural effusion replacing the prior right pneumothorax seen on [**2131-3-26**].

"HISTORY:  62-year-old female, C5 quadriplegic with questionable bowel obstruction status post small bowel resection for previous obstruction. 
Comparison made to most recent abdominal radiograph dated [**2119-8-17**], and CT examination dated [**2119-8-23**]. 
SUPINE PORTABLE ABDOMINAL RADIOGRAPHS. 
FINDINGS:  Bowel gas pattern is nonobstructive with no abnormally dilated loops of large or small bowel identified.  Trace amount of air is noted within the region of the pelvis.  No evidence of pneumatosis or pneumoperitoneum. Diffuse hazy opacity throughout the abdomen corresponds to previously identified ascites.  Surgical clips and staples are noted within the midline and there is a reidentification of bilateral pleural effusions and lower lobe consolidations and extensive degenerative changes/fusion involving the spine and pelvis. 
IMPRESSION: 
No  abnormally dilated loops of bowel."
"SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST 
REASON FOR EXAM:  37-year-old man with relapsed AML with sudden SOB, question fluid overload. 
Comparison is made with prior study dated [**2101-7-8**]. 
FINDINGS:  Diffuse perivascular haze and vascular engorgement which was not present on [**7-5**] and 14, [**2100**].  This finding is compatible with fluid overload without overt pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal contour is difficult to assess in this single portable view of the chest, but possibly unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax or visible pleural effusion.  Lateral costophrenic angles bilaterally were not included in the film.  Unchanged position of the central venous line. 
IMPRESSION:  Fluid overload."
"INDICATION:  71 year old man with severe mitral regurgitation, s/p mitral valve replacement and chest tube removal. 
COMPARISON:  AP and lateral [**2147-2-11**]. 
AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There is stable cardiomegaly with a slightly unfolded aorta.  The patient is s/p mitral valve replacement.  A new small left pleural effusion with retrocardiac opacification in the left lower lobe is seen.  There is a smaller right pleural effusion.  There is apparent flattening of the diaphragms with suggestion of apical bullae bilaterally. The soft tissue and osseous structures are unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION:  1)  Bilateral small pleural effusions, left greater than right. 2)  Left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity, likely atelectasis in this recently post op patient.  3)  Probable underlying emphysema with possible apical bullae."

HISTORY:  Perirenal hematoma.  Respiratory distress. 
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**9-8**] through 7: 
Tip of the new right internal jugular line passes as far as the mid lower superior vena cava.  Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion, moderate left pleural effusion, unchanged.  Right lower lobe consolidation has progressed, probably worsening atelectasis while left lower lobe collapse is unchanged. No pneumothorax.  ET tube and left transjugular right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are in standard placements.  Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view.  The heart is mildly enlarged and remains leftward shifted.  No pneumothorax."
"INDICATION:  Patient with dyspnea. 
COMPARISONS:  None available. 
FINDINGS: 
Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate normal lung volumes without pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  The hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Heart size is normal.  There is no pulmonary edema.  A 9-mm ovoid density, likely calcified projecting over right lung apex, may represent a calcified granuloma.  Prominent air-filled loops of bowel with air-fluid levels are noted in imaged upper abdomen. 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process. 
2.  A 9-mm opacity projecting over right lung apex may represent calcified granuloma, but other pulmonary nodule not excluded; chest CT would provide better evaluation/characterization. 
3.  Air-filled loops of bowel with air-fluid levels are noted in the imaged upper abdomen, not fully evaluated.  Correlate clinically and consider additional imaging as warranted."
"AP BEDSIDE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:

IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**3-3**]: 
Chin is down, and tip of the ET tube is at the thoracic inlet, between 3 and 4 cm from the carina.  Tip could be advanced 2 cm for optimal placement. Diffuse pulmonary opacification which improved between [**3-3**] and [**3-4**] has subsequently worsened slightly.  Heart is top normal or mildly enlarged, but substantially obscured by adjacent pulmonary abnormality.  Marked fullness in the mediastinal veins suggest a component of volume overload. 
Small pleural effusions are probably present.  No pneumothorax.  Nasogastric tube passes into the mid stomach."
"PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Compared to prior radiograph from [**8-12**], [**2200**], a new left retrocardiac opacity is seen which may represent atelectasis; however, pneumonia cannot be excluded.

"PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON [**10-26**] 
HISTORY:  Obstructive pneumonia.  Squamous cell lung cancer.  Evaluate pleural effusion. 
IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to [**10-19**] through 19: 
Small bilateral pleural effusion is stable.  Mild elevation at the base of the left lung has been slowly developing.  This is explained either by worsening volume loss in the severely consolidated left upper lobe or embarrassment of the phrenic nerve by hilar and mediastinal mass.  New interstitial abnormality developed since [**10-24**] is by virtue of time course edema not lymphangitic spread of tumor.  Within the consolidated and partially atelectatic left upper lobe one can see multiple lung nodules.  Heart size normal."
"INDICATION:  Chest pain.  Evaluate for pneumothorax. 
COMPARISON:  None. 
TECHNIQUE:   Single AP portable upright chest.

There is a focal density in the right mid zone not present on the prior study of [**2188-10-6**] and possibly due to composite vascular and bone density in this region. However, evaluation on a repeat follow up film is recommended to r/o a nodular density. Chemo embolization contrast is present in the liver. 
IMPRESSION: Linear atelectasis at left base. Focal density possibly composite shadowing in right mid zone but for which a repeat PA film is recommended."
"(REVISED) PORTABLE AP UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH 
CLINICAL INDICATION: ST elevations, abdominal pain. Left 
No comparison is available. 
FINDINGS: The heart size is normal.  There is right apical density associated with volume loss of the right lung and tenting of the right hemidiaphragm. This suggests partial collapse of the RUL. There is prominence of the right superior mediastinum which most likely represents vascular structures. The hilar contours are normal. There is opacity at the right lung base.  There are degenerative changes to the thoracic spine. 
IMPRESSION: 1) Right basilar opacity which likely represents atelectasis.  An early infectious process cannot be excluded. 2) supect partial collapse of the RUL. Comparison with old images would be helpful."

Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  There are coalescing alveolar opacities in the right lower lobe which have progressed in the interval. Left lower lobe opacities appear similar allowing for differences in technique. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Worsening opacity in right lower lobe.  Given history of recent bronch, this could be due to lavage fluid but other process is also possible such as aspiration or pneumonia. 
2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions. 
3.  No significant change in left lower lobe opacity allowing for incomplete imaging of the left lung laterally."
"Knee, [**2201-1-18**], with indication of fall.  Instability. 
A well-corticated 7-mm diameter osseous density adjacent to the superior margin of the patella may reflect an accessory ossification center or the sequela of old injury.  Increased ossification is also demonstrated along the patellar surface superiorly.  No acute fracture or dislocation is identified. Mild disc space narrowing is present in the medial compartment of the knee. Soft tissue structures are remarkable for a questionable small suprapatellar effusion.

The lungs otherwise appear clear, and no pleural effusions are evident. 
Degenerative changes are observed within the spine. 
IMPRESSION:  Apparent small nodular opacity at the left base near the hemidiaphragm, possibly due to nipple shadow.  Recommend repeat radiograph with nipple markers for confirmation and to exclude a small nodule at this site.  It is important for the patient to take a strong inspiratory effort at the time of follow up film with nipple markers."
"HISTORY:  intra aortic balloon pump placement. 
FRONTAL CHEST:  Comparison [**2116-9-11**].  There has been interval CABG  with sternal wires and skin staples noted. Intra aortic balloon pump terminates with tip overlying left  5th posterior rib at the level of the aortic knob. PA catheter has its tip in proximal branch of right pulmonary arterial tree. ET tube in satisfactory position. No pneumothorax identified. Cresentric air along left heart border suggesting pneumopericardium.  Bilateral hazy opacities right greater than left is seen overlying the lung fields. Cardiac and mediastinal contours appear stable allowing for differences in technique. No osseous abnormalities detected. 
IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory placement of lines and tubes. Status post CABG with pneumopericardium. Bilateral hazy opacities may represent pulmonary edema or posteriorly layering bilateral pleural effusions."
"PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON [**9-30**] 
HISTORY:  Hemoptysis.  Lung cancer.  New left pleural effusion. 
IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to [**9-29**]: 
Generalized interstitial abnormality and vascular congestion in the lungs have progressed since [**9-29**] is probably edema, alternatively generalized pulmonary drug reaction.  Small bilateral pleural effusions have developed since [**9-27**].  Right suprahilar mass is longstanding and the extent of central lymph node enlargement is underestimated by conventional radiographic findings.  Heart size normal.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23416**] and I discussed the findings and their clinical significance over the telephone at the time of dictation."
"INDICATION:  An 87-year-old woman with multiple pulmonary emboli.  Please evaluate for clots. 
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY VEINS:  The left common femoral, femoral, and popliteal veins were interrogated with color flow and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 76**].  The left  popliteal vein and femoral vein are not compressible, and no identifiable waveform is seen within these vessels. This is consistent with intraluminal thrombus. 
The right common femoral,  femoral, popliteal veins, and the left common femoral vein all demonstrate normal color flow and Doppler waveforms, as well as compressibility, respiratory variation, and augmentation. 
IMPRESSION:  DVT  of the left femoral and popliteal veins."
"INDICATIONS:  Cholecystitis. 
GALLBLADDER DRAINAGE:  After informed written consent was obtained, the right upper abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. 1% Lidocaine was administered as a local anesthetic.  Under ultrasound guidance, an 8 French [**Last Name (un) 980**] catheter was placed into the gallbladder and approximately 90 to 100 cc of bilious fluid drained.  The catheter could not be placed via a transhepatic approach. Samples were sent to microbiology. No immediate complications occurred. 
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 547**] supervised the procedure. 
IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of 8 French cholecystostomy tube. The catheter should be left in for at least six weeks for a mature tract to form."

Remodeling changes are seen in the right superior and inferior pubic rami compatible with prior fracture. 
IMPRESSION:  Status post placement of intramedullary rod and gamma nail in the right femur.  No evidence of hardware failure."
"INDICATION:  Worsening hypoxia, evaluate for interval change of effusion and infiltrates. 
FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest obtained with the patient in semi-erect position is analyzed in direct comparison with the next previous similar study obtained approximately five hours earlier.  The present film suffers from motion artifact as the patient apparently was unable to hold respiration.  The previously described parenchymal densities persist but any significant interval change is impossible to quantify.  As before, there is no evidence of significant cardiac enlargement and the lateral pleural sinuses remain free. No evidence of pneumothorax. 
IMPRESSION:  Technically suboptimal chest examination, no significant intravenous contrast in comparison with preceding examination obtained earlier the same date."
"PA AND LATERAL CHEST, [**2102-4-16**] 
OMPARISON:  [**2102-4-14**]. 
FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Airspace consolidation in the left lower lobe has worsened and is concerning for an evolving pneumonia.  Subtle hazy ground-glass opacity lateral to right hilum could reflect an additional site of infection.  Bronchial wall thickening is mild and suggest coexisting airways infection or inflammation.  Small pleural effusions are present bilaterally, left greater than right. 
IMPRESSION:  Evolving pneumonia in left lower lobe as well as possible new site of infection in right perihilar region.  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 35223**] was telephoned with these findings on [**2102-4-16**] at 10 a.m."

FINDINGS:  Since prior examination, there has been interval development of a moderate right-sided pleural effusion with associated leftward mediastinal deviation.  Otherwise, no significant interval change since prior examination, persistent opacification overlying the right lower lung zone.  Surgical clips and markers are seen in the left perihilar region.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. 
IMPRESSION:  Interval development of moderate right pleural effusion since the examination from 1 a.m.  Otherwise, no significant interval change."
"(REVISED) INDICATION:  Follow up study for right-sided middle cerebral artery infarct with subsequent hemorrhage, following TPA treatment.  Worsening headache. 
TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast head CT scan. 
FINDINGS:  Comparison with the prior study of [**2165-11-8**] reveals, at most, perhaps very slight mass effect exerted upon the right-sided wall of the 3rd ventricle, as imaged on only one section (number 12).  However, there has been apparent resolution of hemorrhage within the 3rd ventricle itself.  No other signs of new hemorrhage or other progression of mass effect or surrounding edema is appreciated. 
CONCLUSION:  Negligible interval change as noted above."

There is no pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion. Subcutaneous emphysema in the lower lateral chest walls is stable.  There is no pneumomediastinum.  The heart is normal size.  Nasogastric tube follows a direct course to the upper stomach.  Tip of the left subclavian line projects over the SVC."
"INDICATION:  69 year old woman with shortness of breath status post vomiting around the NG tube. 
COMPARISON:  [**2107-1-25**]. 
PORTABLE AP SUPINE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There has been interval removal of the NG tube.  There is a Swan-Ganz cathter via the right IJ, whose tip is in the right main pulmonary artery.  There is continued left lower lobe collapse/consolidation with a left pleural effusion that is unchanged from the prior study.  The heart size is at the upper limits of normal with prominence of the pulmonary vasculature with upper zone redistribution, slightly improved from the prior study.  The fluid in the fissure seen on the prior study has decreased, suggestive of improving right pleural effusion. 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Continued left lower lobe collapse/consolidation with left pleural effusion, unchanged. 
2.  Improving cardiac failure with decreased right pleural effusion."
"AP SEMI-UPRIGHT CHEST [**2171-10-16**] 
COMPARISON:  [**2171-10-14**]. 
INDICATION:  PICC line placement. 
Right PICC line makes a cephalad turn at the expected junction of the right subclavian and right internal jugular veins.  Tracheostomy tube and airway stents are unchanged in position.  Diffuse mediastinal widening is unchanged. Vascular engorgement and perihilar haziness have worsened likely due to volume overload.  There is worsening atelectasis involving the right lower and right middle lobes.  Pulmonary nodules consistent with widespread mets are better demonstrated on CT.  In the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, gastric distention is noted. 
IMPRESSION:  Malposition of right PICC line, as communicated to the venous access nurse caring for the patient by telephone on [**2171-10-16**]."
"INDICATION:  Right frontal brain lesion.  Preop placement for wand protocol and surgery. 
COMPARISON:  [**2122-5-6**]. 
WAND PROTOCOL FOR STEREOTATIC SURGERY: MR BRAIN W/CONTRAST:  The large enhancing right parietal mass is again noted with a  central low intensity region, consistent with necrosis.  Surrounding edema is again seen evidenced by low T1 signal in the surrounding brain parenchyma.  There is no mass effect, shift of the normally midline structures, or abnormal extra-axial collection.  No other regions of enhancement are identified.  The paranasal sinuses demonstrate normal signal. 
IMPRESSION:  Wand protocol performed for stereotatic surgery of right parietal mass."
"INDICATION:  Subcutaneous emphysema follow up. 
PORTABLE CHEST:  Comparison is a made to earlier film from 3:58 p.m. the same day.  Previously noted tubes and catheters are without interval change. Subcutaneous emphysema persists in the neck and right upper abdomen laterally. Again, vertically oriented lucencies projecting over the lung fields medially are consistent with abnormal soft tissue air, in the soft tissues of the chest wall and/or mediastinum.  Midline structures are stable.  Extensive diffuse bilateral parenchymal infiltrates persist without change.  No pneumothorax is identified on this supine film (note that the left lateral costophrenic angle is not included). 
IMPRESSION:  No change from earlier film of today."
"PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST: 
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is an infant who was born one of [**Known lastname 42585**] with severe prematurity. 
There continues to be focal, dense opacity in the region of the right upper lobe.  This opacity is without associated volume loss and in fact exerts mass effect on the right lower lobe.  Developing opacity at the right costophrenic angle is also present.  These findings are superimposed on diffuse bilateral lung disease.  The ETT, NGT, and PDA clips are in unchanged position. 
IMPRESSION:  Overall unchanged appearance to the chest with persistent right upper lobe opacity with mass effect.  This could represent interpulmonary fluid or loculated fluid within a fissure.  Further evaluation with a lateral projection and decubitus projection was recommended and will be performed today."
"INDICATION:  Assault. 
The projection of a backboard over both radiographs mildly limits the visible detail. 
SUPINE AP PORTABLE CHEST: A small portion of the lateral left hemithorax has been excluded from examination.  An endotracheal tube ends between the clavicles and the carina.  A nasogastric tube ends in the stomach.  Accounting for the AP supine technique, the heart size and mediastinum are probably normal.  The pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits.  The lungs are free of focal opacities.  No pneumothorax is detected.  The visualized osseous structures are intact. 
PORTABLE AP PELVIS:  No fracture or dislocation is detected.  The joint spaces are preserved.  The visualized soft tissues are unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION: Endotracheal tube in satisfactory position.  No acute pulmonary disease.  No fracture detected."
"REASON FOR EXAM:  Fever, please evaluate for acute infectious process. 
COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs and chest CT with the most recent from [**2134-11-3**]. 
FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  This study is severely limited due to patient's body habitus.  Prominance of the pulmonary interstitial markings can rpresent mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Multifocal patchy opacities can represent bilateral pneumonia. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Heart is enlarged.  Aorta demonstrates normal contour.  Exaggerated kyphosis at lower thoracic spine is grossly stable since CT from [**2134-10-5**]. 
IMPRESSION: 1. Limited study due to patient's body habitus. Multifocal patchy opacities can represent bilateral pneumonia. 
2. Cardiomegaly. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion."
"AP CHEST, 7:03 A.M. ON [**11-17**]. 
HISTORY:  Small cell lung cancer, increasing shortness of breath and hypoxia. 
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**11-17**], 1:18 a.m.: 
Although ET tube is in standard position, left lung is almost entirely collapsed.  The absence of rightward mediastinal shift suggests that the volume of atelectasis exceeds the increase if any in left pleural effusion. Right lung is grossly clear.  Cardiac silhouette partially obscured. Distension of the right lower paratracheal soft tissue is due largely to adenopathy.  Nasogastric tube passes as far as the gastroesophageal junction, beyond which the tip is obscured.  No pneumothorax.  Left subclavian line tip projects over the SVC."
"CLINICAL HISTORY:  20-year-old female with elevated intracranial pressure from HSV meningoencephalitis.  Evaluate for interval change. 
COMPARISON:  [**2166-10-26**]. 
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT:  Limited evaluation secondary to streak artifact from scalp electrodes.  Compared to prior study there is severely increased edema within the right temporal and frontal lobe.  Ventricles are grossly unchanged in configuration.  The basal cisterns remain effaced.  Again seen is a focus of high density within the right temporal lobe likely representing hemorrhage, not significantly changed from prior exam.  No new large intraparenchymal hemorrhage is detected. 
IMPRESSION:  Limited evaluation secondary to streak artifact from scalp electrode, however compared to prior exam there is  worsening global edema, particularly marked within the right temporal hemisphere."
"CHEST X-RAY 
HISTORY:  Laryngospasm.  ET tube placement, evaluate pulmonary edema. 
One portable view.  No previous studies are available for comparison.  The right costophrenic sulcus is not entirely included.  There is some motion artifact.  There is increased density at the lung bases suspicious for parenchymal consolidation.  There is streaky density at the left base consistent with subsegmental atelectasis as well.  The cardiac silhouette is prominent but may be exaggerated by AP technique.  Mediastinal structures are otherwise unremarkable.  An endotracheal tube has been inserted and terminates just above the thoracic inlet. 
IMPRESSION:  Limited study demonstrating evidence for bibasilar pulmonary infiltrates.  Is there a history of possible aspiration?  Chest x-ray followup is recommended."
"INDICATION:  Status post Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy for benign stricture now intubated, follow up. 
COMPARISON:  [**2188-1-23**]. 
TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable supine chest. 
FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube terminates 5.2 cm from the carina, at the level of the thoracic inlet.  This may be advanced slightly for optimal positioning. Left subclavian venous access catheter terminates in upper SVC in unchanged position.  Heart size and mediastinal contours appear unchanged.  Since the previous examination, there is increase in bilateral hazy opacity suggesting increased pleural effusions and pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  Right clavicular pseudoarthrosis again noted.  Nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach.  A catheter projecting over the left lower quadrant likely represents change in position of the previously seen intraperitoneal drainage catheter. 
IMPRESSION:  Worsening moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions."
"PORTABLE BABYGRAM 
HISTORY:  24-day-old infant with increased bilious aspirates and abdominal distention. 
FINDINGS:  Compared with the study done earlier today at 1307 hours.  There is continued gas distention throughout the abdomen.  No evidence of free intraperitoneal air, pneumatosis, or portal venous gas.  An enteric feeding tube is seen with tip in the stomach.  There are diffuse bilateral hazy lung opacities.  This is slightly increased since the prior exam.  An endotracheal tube is seen with tip above the level of the carina.  A right PICC line is seen with tip in the SVC. 
IMPRESSION:  Gas-distended abdomen without evidence of pneumatosis or free intraperitoneal air."
"HISTORY: 77 year old man with continued heel pain despite no ulcer on exam. Please evaluate for spurs or bony changes. 
AP oblique and lateral views of the right foot on [**2191-4-15**]: No old films are available for comparison. There has been amputation of the 1st and 2nd digits distal to the metacarpophalangeal joints. The bones are osteopenic, but no focal cortical bony loss is noted. Marked vascular calcification is seen. A small posterior calcaneal spur is noted. 
IMPRESSION: 1st and 2nd digit amputation. Marked vascular calcification. No evidence of osteomyelitis."
"STUDY:  Lower extremity arterial noninvasives at rest. 
REASON:  Right foot ischemic rest pain. 
FINDINGS:  Doppler waveform analysis reveals monophasic waveforms at the right common femoral, popliteal, DP and PT.  In the left leg there are monophasic waveforms at the common femoral, popliteal and DP.  The PT is absent. Reliable ABIs could not be obtained due to noncompressible vessels.  The right great toe pressure is zero.  The left great toe pressure is 40. 
Pulse volume recordings show significantly dampened waveforms in the thigh bilaterally.  There is minimal additional dampening at the calf or ankle level bilaterally and there is a flat trace on the right forefoot with a significant dropoff between the ankle and forefoot. 
IMPRESSION:  Bilateral multilevel arterial occlusive disease."
"EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views. 
CLINICAL INFORMATION:  52-year-old male with history of shortness of breath. 
COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, including [**2168-3-3**], [**2167-3-11**], [**2166-8-24**], and chest CT from [**2166-4-8**]. 
Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs remain hyperinflated, with increased AP diameter, consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/pulmonary emphysema.  Subtle patchy opacity is noted in the right mid lung, which is similar to that seen on [**2167-3-11**], but apparently new since [**2168-3-3**] and findings raise concern for infectious process.  Prominence of the left hilum is stable.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The aorta is slightly tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. 
IMPRESSION:  Subtle right mid lung opacity, new since [**2168-3-3**], but similar in appearance as compared to [**2167-3-11**], raising the question of a new infectious process."
"INDICATION:  History of left mastectomy. 
DIAGNOSTIC MAMMOGRAM, RIGHT:  There are scattered fibroglandular densities. Within the right upper-central breast, there are four and possibly five very round microcalcifications which are uniform in size and shape.  These were not present on the previous exams from [**2130-5-19**] and [**2129-5-18**].  There is no associated density.  No areas of architectural distortion are seen.  No spiculated masses are identified today. 
IMPRESSION:  New tiny cluster of round, benign appearing microcalcifications in the right upper-central breast.  Six month follow up mammogram is recommended.  This was discussed with the patient who will schedule this appointment. 
BIRADS 3 - probably benign, 6 month follow up recommended."
"ULTRASOUND-GUIDED THERAPEUTIC PARACENTESIS 
HISTORY:  78-year-old woman with likely malignant ascites.  Please assess for therapeutic paracentesis. 
Review of recent CT scan shows small-to-moderate amount of ascites.  On ultrasound examination again, small-to-moderate amount of ascites is identified, but there was air-filled hyperdynamic/moving loops of small bowel in all four quadrants of the abdomen.  It was felt that the amount of ascites present and its drainage was unlikely to be of any therapeutic benefit at the present time.  The results were discussed with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9968**] by me.  Patient was returned to the floor. 
CONCLUSION:  Assessment of the small fluid pockets did not reveal any current merit for a therapeutic paracentesis."

SINGLE PORTABLE AP SUPINE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The patient is s/p median sternotomy. There are skin staples over the midline.  The mediastinal tubes and chest tubes are in standard position.  The endotracheal tube is 2.2 cm above the carina. Again seen is a left ventricular assist device.  There is no pneumothorax.  No congestive heart failure.  There is slight worsening of the left lower lobe opacity since the prior exam.  There is moderate cardiomegaly which appears slightly increased since the prior exam.  There is no evidnece of pneumomediastinum, though is difficult to assess intra-abdominal free air on this supine exam. 
IMPRESSION:  Appropriately positioned tubes and lines.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Slightly worsened left lower lobe opacity."
"INDICATION:  Intubated for infectious respiratory failure.  Evaluate left subclavian line. 
SINGLE VIEW CHEST:  Comparison is made to the study done 16 hours earlier. 
This radiograph is severely limited due to patient's body habitus and patient motion.   The left subclavian line terminates at the level of the confluence of the brachiocephalic veins and does not yet make the expected down turn into the SVC.  No pneumothorax is identified though the evaluation is limited by technical factors and the somewhat erect positioning of the patient.  The left PICC is no longer visualized.  No new areas of consolidation are appreciated.

"STUDY:  SUPINE AND UPRIGHT VIEWS OF THE ABDOMEN. 
INDICATION:  53-year-old female with nausea and vomiting.  Assess for small- bowel obstruction. 
COMPARISONS:  [**2128-6-23**]. 
FINDINGS:  There is no free air beneath the diaphragms.  Multiple chain sutures are noted within the right lower quadrant and project over the pelvis as well.  Similarly multiple clips project over the left abdomen and pelvis. A few air-fluid levels are noted in the left upper and lower quadrants. A minimally distended loop of small bowel, filled with air, is located in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen.  Soft tissues and osseous structures are otherwise unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION:  The patient is status post colectomy. Nonspecific bowel gas pattern. Clinical correlation recommended."
"HISTORY:  Fever, abdominal pain and vomiting. 
FINDINGS:  A limited ultrasound examination was performed.  There is diffuse increased echogenicity of the liver, suggesting fatty infiltration. Evaluation of the gallbladder shows no luminal distention, wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid or gallstones.  No son[**Name (NI) 64**] [**Name2 (NI) 567**] sign was present.  There is a rim of decreased echogenicity in the hepatic parenchyma adjacent to the gallbladder, which is a nonspecific finding.  There is no biliary ductal dilatation.  The common duct measures 5mm. 
IMPRESSION: 1) Increased hepatic echogenicity, consistent with fatty infiltration.  Other forms of hepatic disease including significant fibrosis or cirrhosis cannot be excluded on the bases of this study alone. 2) Nonspecific decreased echogenicity in the hepatic parenchyma adjacent to the gallbladder, with no other evidence to suggest cholecystitis."
"REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with tracheostomy and history of subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**2141-10-24**]. 
The tracheostomy is in unchanged standard position.  The right PICC line tip isdifficult to indentify  and potentially may be in the right atrium. The NG tube passes below the diaphragm most likely terminating in the stomach. 
Slight increase in bilateral perihilar opacities is demonstrated, right more than left which might represent worsening of pulmonary edema giving it symmetric appearance and relatively rapid change.  No sizeable pleural effusion is identified. 
IMPRESSION:  Possibly too distal position of the right PICC line.  Evaluation with repeated radiograph, AP and lateral view would be recommended for precise location of the tip. 
Mild worsening of the perihilar opacities might represent developing pulmonary edema."
"INDICATIONS:  History of SOB with intubation, Swan-Ganz catheter and NG tube placement. 
PORTABLE AP CHEST:  Endotracheal tube is 6 cm above carina. The tip of the Swan-Ganz catheter is in right main pulmonary artery.

Prominent bullus emphysema is present in the upper zones and patchy consolidation and atelectasis at the lung bases, left greater than right. A density overlying the mediastinal in right paravertebral region could be dilated gas filled esophagus. 
IMPRESSION: No pneumothorax.  Prominent upper lobe emphysema and bibasilar consolidation/atelectasis.  Possible gas- filled dilated esophagus."
"CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Follow up CSF lymphoma. 
NONCONTRAST CT OF THE NECK:  The exam is compared to prior study of [**4-19**]. 
FINDINGS:  The fluid collection in the posterior neck is not as well visualized as on the head CT due to artifact from the dental amalgum on this neck study.  There has been no definite change in the size of the fluid collection thought to represent cerebral spinal fluid in the region adjacent to the left suboccipital craniotomy defect when compared to the previous exam. There is no evidence of mass within the neck. 
IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of fluid collection in the operative site consistent with CSF."

"AP PORTABLE CHEST. 
INDICATION:  56 year old male with ARDS, hypoxia, question aspiration. 
Comparison is made to the prior examination of [**2191-6-5**]. 
FINDINGS:  A left internal jugular central venous line and NG tube are seen in stable position.  The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  The cardiomediastinal borders are unchanged.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal. There is continued interval improvement of parenchymal opacities, now mostly located in peripheral areas in the mid and lower lung zones.  No pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Bilateral healed rib fractures are again noted. 
IMPRESSION:  Interval continued improvement of bilateral air space opacities in the mid and lower lung zones, now mostly in peripheral distribution.  In addition to likely diagnosis of ARDS, the peripheral distribution of these opacities raises the question of possible hypersensitivity pneumonitis."
"HISTORY:  Assess NG tube position. 
COMPARISON:  [**2122-12-8**] 
AP CHEST:  The endotracheal tube tip is just above the thoracic inlet. The patient has a left IJ line, a right IJ line, both of which are in stable position.  The patient's feeding tube has been removed, and in the interval, an NG tube has been placed, its tip and side port are both in the stomach. 
There is bibasilar atelectasis, unchanged. There is slight redistribution of the vasculature, and probable congestive heart failure has developed in the interval. 
Findings of endotracheal and NG tubes positions were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. [**Doctor Last Name 8160**] on [**2122-12-9**]. 
IMPRESSION:  1)  Probable congestive heart failure. 2)  NG tube in good position. 3)  Tip of endotracheal tube just above the thoracic inlet."
"INDICATION:  63-year-old male status post VATS drainage of  pleural effusion. 
COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies, most recently [**2152-11-29**]. 
PA AND LATERAL CHEST: 
There is little change in comparison to prior study.  Small pleural effusions with additional scarring at the left base and blunting of the left costophrenic angle are unchanged.  There is no increase in pleural effusion, and no pneumothorax.  There is no parenchymal opacity to suggest pneumonia. The pulmonary vasculature is normal in caliber and distribution.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Median sternotomy wires and aortic valve are again noted. Hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. 
IMPRESSION:  No change from [**2152-11-29**].  Small pleural effusions persist, and there is scarring/atelectasis at the left lung base, unchanged."
"CHEST X-RAY 
HISTORY:  NG tube placement. 
One view.  Comparison with [**2137-11-22**].  A nasogastric tube has been inserted and is projected over the upper mediastinum with its tip just below the level of the aortic knob.  Bronchovascular markings are prominent and there is a focal area of increased density at the left base, more apparent than on the earlier study.  The heart and mediastinal structures are unremarkable and unchanged. Gaseous distension of the colon is demonstrated on this upright view. 
IMPRESSION: The nasogastric tube is high and placement should be assessed.  There is a focal area of increased density at the left base which may represent atelectasis or consolidation.  Gaseous distension of the colon. 
The result called to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 71322**] at 4:25 p.m."
"PORTABLE CHEST [**2188-6-5**] 
COMPARISON:  [**2188-6-3**]. 
INDICATION:  Hypoxia. 
FINDINGS:  Improving opacities within the left upper and right mid lungs but possible slight worsening at the left lung base.  These findings may be related to multifocal pneumonia.  Post-operative changes are again demonstrated in the right hemithorax, likely related to previous right upper lobe resection and possible radiation therapy. Asymmetric right apical thickening may reflect post-treatment change, but comparison to older post- operative radiographs would be helpful to exclude recurrence.  Similarly, it would be helpful to compare the post-operative appearance of the right hilum with older studies.  If unavailable, consider CT after the acute parenchymal process resolves. 
IMPRESSION: Multifocal pneumonia. Postoperative appearance in right lung should be compared to priors to ensure stability as detailed above."
"REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  New crackles and increased oxygen requirement in a patient with known COPD. 
Portable AP chest x-ray was compared to the previous film from the same day ___ at 11:38. 
The heart size is top normal.  Thoracic aorta moderately widened and elongated with calcium deposit in the wall mostly at the level of the arch.  A very large hiatal hernia extending to the right of the midline with air fluid level within it is again noted. 
No pulmonary vascular congestion and no new parenchymal opacities are identified.  No pleural effusion is seen.  No changes in the appearance of the malalignment of the left humerus due to previous fracture is identified. 
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of new acute cardiopulmonary process."
"INDICATION:  Check sternal closure, s/p debridement. 
AP upright radiograph dated [**2172-11-24**] is compared with the frontal radiograph dated [**2172-11-22**] and the PA and lateral radiograph dated [**2172-11-18**]. 
The heart size is enlarged with a left ventricular predominance. 
There is widening of the superior mediastinum and widening of the aortic shadow behind the heart.  The sternal sutures are changed compared with the prior radiographs.  The skin staples have been removed.  The lungs are clear. 
The PICC catheter tip is unchanged in position. 
IMPRESSION:  The increase in widening of the descending thoracic aorta can be attributed to postural or technical factors.  However, this radiograph cannot exclude mediastinal widening due to hemorrhage or infection.  If clinically indicated a CT would be helpful to further evaluate the mediastinum."
"PORTABLE CHEST [**2109-8-18**] 
CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Aortic valve replacement and chest tube removal. 
FINDINGS: 
Right IJ sheath remains in place.  There is marked cardiomegaly.  Left chest tube remains in place.  Mediastinal drain appears to have been removed.  There continues to be a small left-sided pleural effusion.  There is marked cardiomegaly with atelectasis at the left lung base.  There are low lung volumes with crowding of the pulmonary vasculature. 
No pneumothorax identified although there is a suboptimal exposure on this radiograph. 
IMPRESSION: 
Status post mediastinal drain removal.  Continued mild atelectasis left lung base with small left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax identified but technique is suboptimal on this radiograph."
"INDICATION:  86-year-old man, followup evaluation of respiratory failure. 
COMPARISON:  [**2182-3-20**]. 
SINGLE SEMI-ERECT VIEW OF THE CHEST AT 5:15 A.M.:  The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 7 cm from the carina, and the right subclavian catheter terminates in the upper SVC. 
Moderate-to-severe bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, are unchanged.  The right pleural effusion again tracks along the right chest wall and into the minor fissure.  The upper lung zones appear better aerated, demonstrating mild pulmonary vascular engorgement and mild interstitial edema. No new foci of consolidation are seen.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. 
IMPRESSION:  Persistent moderate-to-severe bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.  Mild pulmonary edema.  Improved aeration of upper lungs."
"STUDY:  CT-guided pleural biopsy. 
INDICATION:  The patient with multifocal pleural abnormalities on left side and history of both primary renal and thyroid carcinoma.  For evaluation. 
TECHNIQUE:  Informed consent was obtained from the patient.  Preprocedure timeout was performed to confirm patient identity and indication for examination.  Under CT fluoroscopic guidance, a 17-gauge coaxial system was advanced into the largest anterior pleural nodule.  Following this, two 18- gauge core samples were obtained.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate complications.  Onsite cytology showed positive touch prep scan.  No pneumothorax was noted postprocedure. 
CONCLUSION: 
Successful CT-guided pleural biopsy.  The attending, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 16**] , was present and assisted throughout."
"CLINICAL INDICATION:  Elevated white blood cell count and fever. 
Compared to [**2157-3-24**]. 
A tracheostomy tube, central line, feeding tube, and bilateral chest tubes remain in place.  There is stable cardiac enlargement and there is a persistent pattern of congestive heart failure with vascular engorgement and perihilar haziness.  More confluent areas of opacity are seen in the retrocardiac regions.  There are bilateral pleural effusions. 
As compared to the recent study, there has been slight change in distribution of pulmonary opacities, but the overall severity is probably not significantly changed, allowing for differences in positioning. 
IMPRESSION:  Persistent congestive heart failure pattern with associated bilateral pleural effusions.  It is difficult to exclude underlying infection, and follow up radiographs after diuresis may be helpful in this regard."
"INDICATION:  Left great toe osteomyelitis, status post amputation with altered mental status, evaluate for necrosis. 
COMPARISON:  None. 
LEFT FOOT, TWO VIEWS:  Post-surgical changes from partial amputation of the left great toe with stump containing the proximal portion of the proximal phalanx.

"INDICATION:  36-year-old male with ETOH intoxication, post-intubation for airway protection. 
PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Comparison was made to the prior chest radiograph dated [**2180-8-6**].  The endotracheal tube terminates just below the thoracic inlet, approximately 6 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube is coursing down below the left hemidiaphragm and terminating in the expected location of the gastric fundus.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged since prior study with tortuous aorta.  Hilar contours are within normal limits given the technique.  Lungs are clear, without evidence of effusion or CHF.  There are patchy opacities at the bases, likely representing atelectasis. 
IMPRESSION:  Tubes and lines as described above.  Faint patchy opacities at the bases, likely representing atelectasis.  Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary process."
"INDICATION:  75-year-old female with aortic stenosis, pneumonia and hypoxia. Evaluate PICC line placement. 
COMPARISON:  [**2152-4-7**]. 
FINDINGS:  The tip of a left PICC terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  The tip of a right jugular line projects over the upper SVC.

CHEST, ONE VIEW:  Comparison with [**2180-2-9**].  Right internal jugular vein line has been removed.  Left IJ seen with its tip in the distal SVC.  No pneumothorax.  Endotracheal tube is in good position, however, the cuff is over distended.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below from the diaphragm. Right upper lobe density is slightly denser than the [**2180-2-9**] exam. Left lower lobe opacity appears unchanged.  Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are unchanged. 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Left internal jugular vein line successfully placed without pneumothorax. 
2.  Endotracheal tube is overdistended and should be deflated. 
3.  Right upper lobe opacity appears more dense today."
"TWO-VIEW CHEST, [**2117-8-25**]. 
COMPARISON:  [**2117-8-20**]. 
INDICATION:  Fall. 
The patient is status post previous median sternotomy and coronary bypass surgery.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged but stable.  There is upper zone vascular redistribution, but there has been interval improvement in the degree of interstitial pulmonary edema.  Small right pleural effusion persists but has slightly decreased in size in the interval.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The bones are diffusely demineralized.  No acute skeletal fractures are observed, but note is made of incomplete imaging of the lower sternum on the lateral view, limiting full assessment of this region. Finally, note is made of apparent aortic valvular calcifications on the lateral view.  Coronary artery calcifications are also noted. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  No evidence of acute intrathoracic injury. 2.  Resolving congestive heart failure pattern."
"HISTORY:  60-year-old female status post aortic valve replacement and the right internal jugular line placement, to assess for position. 
TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP radiograph of the chest was performed. Comparison is made with prior radiograph dated [**2168-6-7**]. 
FINDINGS: 
The right central line has its tip in the lower SVC adjacent to junction with right atrium . There is linear atelectasis in the right mid and both lower lungs. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  There is no focal pulmonary consolidation.  The patient is status post sternotomy. 
CONCLUSION: 
1.  The right internal jugular line has its tip projected in lower SVC near junction with right atriu . 
2.  Atelectasis in the right mid and bilateral lower lungs with no pulmonary consolidation."
"PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON [**2136-1-23**] AT 11:36. 
INDICATION:  Continued O2 requirement. 
COMPARISON:  [**2136-1-21**]. 
FINDINGS:  The ETT and NGT have been removed.  There has been resolution of perihilar haziness with some residual atelectatic changes seen at the lung bases.  The lateral view shows a patchy density in the right lower lobe with obscuration of the posterior aspect of the right hemidiaphragm.  In the appropriate clinical setting, this could easily represent pneumonia. 
IMPRESSION:  Improved fluid status, but consolidations in the lower lobes which could be pneumonia in the appropriate setting.  The latter appears to be a progression from prior."
"EXAM:  Chest single AP upright portable view. 
CLINICAL INFORMATION:  86-year-old male with history of tachypnea, hypoxia, question pneumothorax, initial chest x-ray earlier today. 
COMPARISON:  [**2173-1-25**] at 18:47. 
FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  The questionable finding of pneumothorax on the prior study is no longer appreciated and was likely due to artifact/possible skin fold.  No definite pneumothorax is seen on the current study.  Bilateral mid to lower lung opacities are again seen without significant interval change.  There are possible trace bilateral pleural effusions.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. 
IMPRESSION:  No definite evidence of pneumothorax on the current study; finding on the prior study was likely artifactual.  Persistent bilateral pulmonary opacities and possible small bilateral pleural effusions."
"TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view. 
INDICATION:  NG tube placement in 42-year-old female patient with malnutrition. 
FINDINGS:  AP single chest view obtained with the patient in semi-erect position.  Image oriented showed to include upper half of the abdomen.

TECHNIQUE:  Right small finger, 3 views. 
COMPARISON:  Prior right finger radiograph from [**2127-11-17**] and upper extremity CT from [**2127-11-5**]. 
FINDINGS: 
Again noted is a fracture at the neck of the proximal phalanx. There is evidence of surrounding  cortical bone loss and bone destruction.  There has been interval increase of soft tissue swelling about the small finger. There is unchanged DIP and PIP joint space narrowing.  Prior ring finger amputation is again seen.  Atherosclerotic aortic calcifications are seen. 
IMPRESSION: Small finger proximal phalanx pathologic fracture with cortical bone loss, bone destruction and increased soft tissue swelling. Findings concerning for infection."
"INDICATION:  Expanding hematoma on right thigh. 
COMPARISON:  Prior right groin ultrasound [**2167-8-19**] and [**2167-8-18**]. 
RIGHT THIGH AND GROIN ULTRASOUND:  Son[**Name (NI) 536**] evaluation in the area of the patient's extensive bruise was performed.

"HISTORY:  87-year-old male with worsening CVA symptoms.  Evaluate for acute process. 
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph [**2132-7-25**] and [**2132-7-24**]. C-spine MRI from [**2128-12-2**]. 
SINGLE SUPINE PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST: Mediastinal widening is likely secondary to tortuosity of the thoracic aorta as this appearance has not changed since [**2131**] CXR. However, this does not appear changed since [**2132-7-24**]. Lung volumes are low though there is no evidence of pneunmonia or CHF. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Osseous structures are unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia. Mediastinal widening appears grossly stable from [**2132-7-24**] CXR -- likely reflecting a tortuous thoracic aorta which was partially visualized on prior c-spine MR ([**2128**])."
"STUDY:  Two-view chest on [**2199-1-21**] compared to [**2199-1-10**]. 
CLINICAL INDICATION:  Fever and cough. 
FINDINGS: 
A left PICC line and feeding tube are in place.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits and stable.  Again, demonstrated is a moderate sized right pleural effusion with a component extending into the right major fissure.  There is adjacent increased opacity within the right lung base, which most likely represents atelectasis. 
Note is also made of apparent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with a change in configuration compared to the baseline preoperative chest radiograph of [**2198-12-20**].  This suggests a subpulmonic component of the right pleural effusion. 
IMPRESSION: 
Persistent moderate sized right pleural effusion with a likely subpulmonic component."
"AP CHEST, 8:35 A.M. ON [**9-21**] 
HISTORY:  Abdominal aortic aneurysm, percutaneous tracheostomy. 
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**9-17**] and [**9-19**]: 
Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions are increasing and mild edema can now be seen in the upper lungs.  Lung bases are partially obscured by effusion and probably atelectatic, particularly the left, with additional radiodensity due to dependent edema.  Under the circumstances, pneumonia need not be invoked, but cannot be excluded. 
Thoracic aorta is generally large and very tortuous, but not any different. The heart is normal size.  No pneumothorax.  Tracheostomy tube is in standard placement.  Feeding tube loops in the stomach, ending in the fundus."
"AP CHEST, 7:21 P.M., [**2-27**] 
HISTORY:  Fungemia.  Left IJ line placed. 
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**2-27**], 8:32 a.m.: 
Tip of the new left internal jugular line projects over the course of the left brachiocephalic vein.  No pneumothorax or change in mediastinal caliber. Small left pleural effusion is larger but has been fluctuating.  Increased vascular caliber in the region of the azygos vein suggests increased central venous pressure and would explain deposition of more edema in region of possible right upper lobe pneumonia.  Left lower lobe consolidation is worsening. 
ET tube in standard placement.  Nasogastric tube passes in the stomach and out of view.  Mild cardiomegaly has increased."
"HISTORY:  An 86-year-old male with right basal ganglia hemorrhage and intraventricular hemorrhage. 
COMPARISON:  Non-contrast head CT one day prior. 
TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained from the cranial vertex to the foramen magnum without IV contrast. 
FINDINGS:  There is no significant change in the appearance of the right putamen and caudate hemorrhage.  Again identified is blood in the third and fourth ventricles.  There is no shift of normally midline structures or evidence of herniation.  The cerebellar tonsils do not demonstrate a change in position to suggest recurrent or impending herniation.

FOUR VIEWS RIGHT HIP 
There is a right intertrochanteric hip fracture with minimal displacement. Fracture lines extend through the greater and lesser trochanters. Femoroacetabular joint is congruent mild degenerative change.  Sclerotic focus in the right acetabulum is stable and likely represents a bone island. Sacroiliac joints and pubic symphysis are not widened.  The left hip demonstrates mild degenerative changes.  There are also mild degenerative changes of the lumbar spine. 
IMPRESSION:  Right intertrochanteric hip fracture. 
Findings discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1263**] on [**2196-3-26**]."
"INDICATION:  New Dobbhoff placement. 
PORTABLE AP CHEST. 
The tip of the Dobbhoff tube is just proximal to the GE junction and should be advanced further for optimal placement, at least 5-6 cm.  The left-sided pacemaker with its leads overlying the right atrium and the right ventricle is in optimal position.  The right-sided PICC line tip terminates over the mid SVC.  No pneumothorax.  Lung fields are clear without pneumonia or pleural effusions.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. 
IMPRESSION:  Dobbhoff tube just proximal to the gastroesophageal junction and should be advanced at least 4-5 cm for optimal placement.  Findings communicated to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1436**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10998**].  No pneumothorax."
"CHEST X-RAY 
HISTORY:  Large right effusion status post drainage. 
One portable view.  Comparison with the previous study done [**2126-10-15**].  There is nearly complete opacification of the right hemithorax by a large right effusion.  A small amount of aerated lung is present.  A chest tube is projected at the right lung base.  The left lung is clear, although bronchovascular markings are prominent.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified. The mediastinal silhouette is partially obscured by pleural fluid.  The bony thorax is grossly intact.  A catheter consistent with a VP shunt catheter traverses the right chest. 
IMPRESSION:  Nearly complete opacification of the right hemithorax by pleural fluid.  A chest tube is projected in the region of the right lung base."
"HISTORY:  Left-sided chest pain and chills. 
CHEST, AP UPRIGHT AND LATERAL:  Comparison is made to [**2186-2-2**] and [**2181-5-17**]. Mild cardiac enlargement and tortuosity of the aorta appear not significantly changed.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are more generally unchanged. There is again a convex contour to the right upper mediastinum.  However, given lack of change since at least [**2181-5-17**], this appearance is probably a normal variant which can likely be attributed to mild tortuosity of the great vessels.  There is new elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, moderate in degree and of unclear significance, but the lungs are otherwise clear. Band-like scarring in the lingula is unchanged. 
IMPRESSION:  No definite evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease."
"AP BEDSIDE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: 
INDICATION: Fever. 
FINDINGS: There is evidence of prior cervical spine surgery with posterior effusion. There is an ETT in stable and satisfactory position when compared to [**2197-5-9**].

PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH. 
COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from [**11-9**], [**11-6**], and [**2136-11-3**]. 
FINDINGS:  Since [**11-3**], there has been progressive right lung opacification likely due to layering pleural effusions.  However, this appearance is similar to the study from [**11-9**].  Left basilar atelectasis with small effusion appears stable.  A tracheostomy catheter is in stable position.  Old right rib deformities are unchanged.  The cardiac silhouette, hilar and mediastinal contours appear stable with slight leftward shift due to volume loss in the left hemithorax. 
IMPRESSION:  Slight progression of right-sided pleural effusion and edema but overall stable appearance to the chest since [**2136-11-9**]."
"INDICATION:  64-year-old male with coronary artery disease, here for preoperative assessment prior to CABG.

Retained contrast material is seen within the descending colon and rectum.  Dense vascular calcifications are present.  Degenerative changes are seen at the hips. 
IMPRESSION: Large amount of free air.  Although 3-5% of patients may have a small amount of free air following PEG tube placement, the volume here is concerning for a perforation.  Findings discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 22205**]."
"PORTABLE CHEST: 
CLINICAL INDICATION:   Right pig-tail catheter placement. 
Since the recent study, a right pig-tail pleural catheter has been placed, with associated resolution of a previously noted large right pleural effusion.  No definite pneumothorax is identified on this supine radiograph.  However, the right hemidiaphragms appear sharper than the left and is difficult to exclude a basilar pneumothorax as a cause of this finding.  A Swan-Ganz catheter remains in the right ventricular outflow tract, and a left subclavian vascular catheter and nasogastric tube remain in satisfactory position.  An endotracheal tube terminates at the thoracic inlet level.  Minor atelectatic changes are noted at the left base. 
IMPRESSION: 
Resolution of right pleural effusion following right sided chest tube placement.  It is difficult to exclude a basilar pneumothorax on this supine radiograph as detailed above."

"CLINICAL HISTORY:  57-year-old woman with GBM. 
STUDY:  MR HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST. 
COMPARISON:  Multiple prior MRI, the most recent dated [**2144-11-26**]. 
TECHNIQUE:  Only sagittal and axial T1-weighted images could be obtained as the patient could not continue with the study.  The acquired images are also degraded by motion artifact. 
FINDINGS:  The study is limited as only axial and sagittal T1-weighted images were obtained.  Postoperative changes are noted in the form of left parietal craniotomy with post-surgical changes in the left frontal and parietal lobes. T1 hyperintensity is noted in the resection cavity which likely represents residual blood products/mineralization. 
The ventricles are unchanged in size since the prior study.

HISTORY:  Atrial fibrillation.  IVDA.  Remote tricuspid valve replacement. Endocarditis. 
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**11-20**] through [**11-26**] at 8:28 a.m.: 
Upright radiograph shows there is no pneumothorax.  Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema has worsened since earlier in the day.  Extensive nodulation and cavitation in the lungs due to septic emboli unchanged.  Small bilateral pleural effusions have increased.  Overall heart size is normal.  Sternal wires are reasonably well aligned despite a fracture of the first and what may be a residual fragment interposed between the first and second wires.  Left internal jugular line ends in the left brachiocephalic vein."
"INDICATION: New onset right hemiparesis and aphasia with status post TPA. 
COMPARISON: MRI of same day. 
TECHNIQUE: CT of the head without IV contrast. 
FINDINGS: There are no intra or extraaxial hemorrhage, edema, or shift of normal midline structures. The ventricles are symmetric in size. There is tortuousity of the vertebral and basilar arteries as was seen on the MRA. 
White matter hypodensity and volume loss are seen, and reflect microvascular ischemia and infarction.  An acute infarction may be difficult to discern, given the gliotic changes. Overall cortical density appears to be preserved. 
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious osseous lesions. 
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage."
"INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with history of Crohn's disease, post exploratory laparotomy and distal ileal resection with new abdominal pain and distention.

TECHNIQUE:  Supine and upright abdominal radiographs were obtained. 
FINDINGS:  There is a nonspecific bowel gas pattern with air visualized throughout the small bowel.  There is no evidence of free air.  Post-surgical staples are visualized in the mid abdomen.  The patient is status post bilateral total hip arthroplasties.  Cholecystectomy clips are visualized in the right upper quadrant.  Two wires are visualized overlying the breast shadows and are suggestive of the patient's bra. 
IMPRESSION:  Nonspecific bowel gas pattern with no evidence of obstruction or free air."
"ARTERIAL STUDY 
HISTORY:  Aortoiliac intervention. 
FINDINGS:  Current study is compared to prior exam of [**2184-9-28**].  Right femoral and popliteal levels remained triphasic.  All other waveforms on the right and the left are monophasic.  This is unchanged.  The ABI on the right is 0.4 and that on the left is 0.43.  The volume recordings demonstrate waveform widening seen diffusely bilaterally.  Exercise testing was also performed with a decline in ABI measurements which did not rebound to baseline up to 3 minutes after resting.  Common femoral remained monophasic on the left and converted from triphasic to monophasic on the right. 
IMPRESSION:  Findings indicating aorto-[**Hospital1 **]-iliac disease as well as right-sided tibial disease."
"NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT SCAN: 
HISTORY:  Acute myologenous leukemia undergoing chemotherapy.  The patient fell on the floor.  Assess for intracranial hemorrhage. 
TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT scan. 
FINDINGS:  There is no definite sign of an intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.  There is no minor or major vascular territorial infarction.  There may be a tiny amount of soft tissue swelling along the right paramedian aspect of the frontal portion of the scalp.

CONCLUSION:  No intracranial hemorrhage."
"INDICATION:  S/P motor vehicle accident, assess right acetabular fracture. 
THREE VIEWS OF THE PELVIS:  As described on the previous CT pelvis of [**2176-11-10**], there is a non-displaced oblique fracture of the right acetabulum, which extends across the anterior column and into the articular surface.  The fracture also extends to the proximal portion of the posterior column.  No intra-articular fragments are detected.  Again noted is diastasis of the right SI joint.  The previously described fracture of the right inferior pubic ramus is not identified on the present exam. 
IMPRESSION:  Non-displaced oblique fracture of the right acetabulum, as discussed.  Non-displaced fracture of the right inferior pubic ramus, described on the CT exam of [**2176-11-10**], is not identified on the present study."
"INDICATION: Short of breath, assess for interval change in congestive heart failure. 
VIEWS: Single AP portable upright view, comparison dated [**2196-8-4**]. 
FINDINGS: A right sided IJ venous access catheter is in unchanged position with tip terminating in distal SVC at the junction of the right atrium. The heart size is unchanged. The pulmonary vasculature is obscured by worsening bilateral pulmonary infiltrates most prominent in the right upper and right middle lobes and left lower lobe. Bilateral pleural effusions are present. The visualized osseous structures are unchanged. There has been interval removal of the ETT and NG tube. 
IMPRESSION: Worsening bilateral interstitial and alveolar process is consistent with pulmonary edema vs. bilateral aspiration."
"CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON [**2179-6-29**] 
Comparison is made with a prior study from approximately three hours earlier. 
CLINICAL HISTORY:  An 86-year-old woman with repositioning of Dobbhoff tube, question tip. 
FINDINGS:  Portable semiupright AP view of the chest.  There is a feeding tube in place with its tip coiled in the stomach.  The right IJ central line, endotracheal tube appear unchanged in position.  Midline skin staples project over the chest.  Left lung base pleural effusion and consolidation is also unchanged.  Lung apices are excluded.  A small right pleural effusion is also noted.

CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Evaluate ETT placement and interval changes. 
COMPARISON STUDY:  [**2113-7-14**] at 15:27. 
FINDINGS: 
Endotracheal tube has been withdrawn and now resides at the thoracic inlet in appropriate position.  The nasogastric tube courses towards the stomach below the edge of the film but the tip is not seen.  There is patchy opacification of the left lung, which appears somewhat less dense since the prior study. This finding could be consistent with improving pneumonia.  The right lung is relatively clear. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  ET tube in satisfactory position at thoracic inlet. 2.  Slight improvement with decreased opacification of the left lung."
"INDICATION:  New left subclavian line placed over a wire. 
The left subclavian central venous catheter tip is at the mid-SVC.  The ET tube is in the proximal right main stem bronchus.  The right subclavian catheter tip is in the right internal jugular vein by approximately 2 cm from its origin.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is increasing left upper lobe opacity likely due to collapse or possible aspiration.  The NG tube is below the diaphragm. 
IMPRESSION:  Right subclavian central venous catheter tip within the right IJ. Satisfactory positioning of the left subclavian line. The ET tube is in the proximal main stem bronchus.  There is increasing left upper lobe opacity."
"PORTABLE CHEST, [**2150-11-9**] 
COMPARISON:  [**2150-10-28**]. 
INDICATION:  Neutropenic fever. 
A left subclavian vascular catheter remains in satisfactory position.  There is persistent widening of the left superior mediastinum consistent with known thyroid enlargement and there is also a right-sided aortic arch resulting in widening of the right mediastinal contour.  Assessment of the lungs demonstrates multifocal pulmonary opacities, with overall improvement in previously reported opacities in the left upper lobe and perihilar region. However, there has been apparent slight worsening of opacification in the right upper lobe centrally, and there is a questionable area of increased opacity in the right retrocardiac region, not present previously. 
IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement in left upper lobe/perihilar opacities, but apparent worsening of central right upper lobe opacity and apparent new right retrocardiac opacity.  Dedicated PA and lateral chest radiographs may be helpful for initial further assessment."
"HISTORY:  A 48-year-old woman status post liver transplant requiring postpyloric feeding tube. 
PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  After coating the weighted feeding tube with lidocaine jelly, the tube was advanced through the right nostril into the stomach.  Air and 5 cc of Conray were infused to elucidate the gastric anatomy.  The wire was then replaced and the tube was advanced into the duodenum and past the ligament of Treitz.  The wire was removed.  Final injection of contrast demonstrated appropriate positioning of the tube tip in the proximal jejunum.  The tube was secured with tape.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and there are no immediate post-procedural complications. 
IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of nasojejunal feeding tube."
"CT SCAN OF THE BRAIN [**2156-10-22**]. 
INDICATION:  Assess for subdural hematoma. 
TECHNIQUE:  Axial non-contrast CT scans of the brain were obtained. 
Comparison is made to the previous CT scan of [**2156-8-15**]. 
FINDINGS: 
Postoperative changes of the right temporal lobe are again identified, as is a right subdural collection along the craniotomy site.  There is no change in the appearance of these findings or of the brain, in the interval since the previous study.  Areas of decreased attenuation are present in the right corona radiata.  This too was seen on the previous study. 
The ventricles are not dilated. 
There is no abnormality of the visualized paranasal sinuses or mastoids. 
IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of the brain since the previous study of [**2156-8-15**]."
"AP CHEST, 5:11 A.M., [**10-12**] 
HISTORY:  Question worsening pneumonia. 
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**9-23**] through 26: 
This is generalized worsening of pulmonary opacification and the substantial increase in volume of moderate right pleural effusion since [**10-10**], most of the lung abnormalities attributable to pulmonary edema, but findings prior to that suggested multifocal pneumonia and currently there is more consolidation in both upper lobes, showing that worsening infection is also present.  Heart is moderately enlarged and azygous distention indicates elevated central venous pressure or volume.  Some of the progression of edema could be due to interval extubation and loss of positive pressure support, but the overall picture is one of cardiac decompensation in the setting of widespread infection."
"INDICATION: 70-year-old woman status post Port-a-Cath placement. 
AP PORTABLE SUPINE VIEW OF THE CHEST: Comparison [**2107-6-25**]. A left-sided central venous line is present with its tip in the lower SVC/cavoatrial junction. The catheter courses along the medial left hemithorax consistent with patient's replaced SVC (left-sided). Note is again made of a large right hilar mass. An opacity is present at the left lateral base consistent with atelectasis and/or effusion. The right lung is clear, without pleural effusions or focal areas of consolidation. 
IMPRESSION: Central venous line with catheter tip in the region of the cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax."
"STUDY:  Chest x-ray. 
INDICATION:  Patient status post cystectomy.?Heart failure or infection. 
TECHNIQUE:  PA frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained. 
COMPARISON:  [**2179-8-27**]. 
A left basilar pleural effusion is identified, the right basal pleural effusion is not clearly resolvable now.  Patient's NG tube has been removed. Some generalized increased markings are present consistent with COPD.  Medial basilar infiltrate identified in the right side is unchanged, but represents a definite new development when compared to radiographs going back to [**8-25**].  Unchanged significant biapical pleural capping. 
CONCLUSION: 
Again identified is a right basilar infiltrate. This is felt to reflect some developing consolidation.  Left-sided pleural effusion is seen."
"INDICATION:  Large MCA stroke, now with new temps, dyspnea and congestion. 
Comparison:  [**2177-3-30**]. 
CHEST, TWO FRONTAL VIEWS:  There is stable cardiac enlargement.  There is persistent pulmonary  vascular redistribution, perihilar haziness, and bilateral diffuse alveolar opacities.  While the appearance of the lungs seems somewhat worse on the vertically oriented radiograph, there appears to be an interval improvement in the horizontal radiograph. 
IMPRESSION:  The differences demonstrated in the pulmonary edema in the interval from the vertically oriented radiograph to the horizontal radiograph on the same day, may represent interval improvement of the diffuse pulmonary edema.  Overall, this may be slightly improved."
"CHEST 
HISTORY:  Bilateral effusions and chest tube placement. 
One view.  Comparison with the previous study done [**2173-12-8**].  A small right pleural effusion and moderate left pleural effusion are again demonstrated.  A chest tube has been inserted on the left and the left effusion has probably decreased slightly in size.  There is now increased density in the retrocardiac area with a suggestion of an air bronchogram.  The cardiac silhouette is prominent, as before.  Mediastinal structures are unchanged. The bony thorax is grossly intact. 
IMPRESSION:  Probable interval decrease in left pleural effusion plus chest tube placement.  Development of increased retrocardiac density consistent with atelectasis or consolidation."
"EXAMINATION:  AP chest. 
INDICATION:  Persistent cough.  Tachycardia. 
Single AP view of the chest is obtained on [**2175-11-4**], 1620 hours and is compared with the study performed the same day at 0920 hours.  There has been improvement in the aeration in the left lung with return of the heart more to the midline.  Diffuse enlargement of the cardiac silhouette remains. Bilateral pleural effusions persist.  Interstitial edema persists as does vascular congestion and the findings are consistent with congestive heart failure.  A pacemaker/ICD device in place. 
IMPRESSION: 
Improvement in the aeration of the left lung.  Pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusion.  Effusion on the right side appears to have increased since the prior examination."
"INDICATION:  HIV, HCV, HBV with increasing abdominal girth. 
Targeted examination of the right upper quadrant was performed. 
FINDINGS:  The liver is coarsened and nodular in architecture.  There is moderate ascites.  Portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow.  There is gallbladder wall edema.  The gallbladder is not distended.  There is a 4-mm polyp within the gallbladder.  No shadowing stones.  No intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.  Common duct measures 7 mm.  Right kidney measures 12.5 cm. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Patent portal vein with hepatopetal flow. 2.  Gallbladder wall edema with no shadowing stones.  This may be attributable to the patient's liver disease and diffuse third spacing. 3.  Moderate ascites."
"AP CHEST 09:08 A.M ON [**1-24**] 
HISTORY:  Note left PIC position for nutrition and antibiotics. 
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**1-22**]: 
Tip of the left PIC line is at or just above the superior cavoatrial junction. Consolidation in the left lower lobe has improved over the past several days, but at the right base, although it has changed in extent, it has not improved and there has been an increase in the small right pleural effusion, now partially fissural, since removal of the right pleural tube.  Left upper lobe is clear.  The heart is top normal size, exaggerated by adjacent pleural fluid."

IMPRESSION:  Improved mild pulmonary edema with trace right greater than left pleural effusions and no evidence of pneumothorax."
"INDICATION:  43-year-old man status post polytrauma, obtained upright and lateral.  Evaluate for free air. 
COMPARISON:  Portable abdominal radiograph from [**2198-6-4**]. 
FINDINGS:  There is free air demonstrated on the left lateral decubitus films. Small bowel loops appear distended, predominantly within the left lower quadrant, which may represent an ileus.  Staples are seen overlying the abdomen. Bony structures are unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION:  Moderate pneumoperitoneum.  Multiple dilated loops of small bowel, predominantly in the left lower quadrant, which may be from postoperative ileus. 
These findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13190**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5278**] via telephone at 5:10 p.m."
"INDICATION:  63 y/o man with end-stage liver disease and persistent O2 dependence with known pleural effusions. 
AP upright single view of chest is compared to [**2198-3-9**]. 
FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged in appearance. There is a decrease in the low lung volumes, which are very low. Pulmonary vascularity is difficult to evaluate due to the position and the low lung volumes.  Cannot rule out early CHF.  There are probable bilateral pleural effusion.  There is a new left lower lobe atelectasis or consolidation. 
IMPRESSION: 1. Low lung volumes. 2. Small bilateral plueral effusions. 3. Left lower lobe collapse/consolidation is new.  Correlate clinically. 4. Pulmonary vasculature is difficult to evaluate due to low lung volumes and position.  Cannot rule out CHF."

Given differences in plane of scan, there has been no appreciable change in the size of the right parietal parenchymal hematoma with adjacent subarachnoid hemorrhage and vasogenic edema.  As before, the hematoma measures approximately 3.8 cm in greatest diameter.  There is no evidence of new hemorrhage, or new acute cortical infarct. 
IMPRESSION:  Right parietal parenchymal hematoma with adjacent subarachnoid hemorrhage, similar to the recent CT.  The appearance remains most suspicious for cerebral amyloid angiopathy.  As noted on the prior examinations, continued followup is suggested to ensure there is no underlying mass."
"INDICATION:  63-year-old woman with epigastric pain and vomiting. 
COMPARISON:  [**2131-9-29**]. 
SINGLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST AT 8:40 A.M.:  There are no acute abnormalities.  There is no evidence of free intraperitoneal air.  Lungs are clear with unchanged elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with pleural thickening unchanged. There is no consolidation or pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax. 
The cardiac silhouette is enlarged with apparent left ventricular enlargement. Mild aortic tortuosity is stable. There is no mediastinal or hilar enlargement. Pulmonary vascularity is normal. Degenerative changes are again noted along the spine. Soft tissue and bony structures are otherwise unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION:  No CHF or pneumonia. Boot-shaped cardiac configuration suggests LV enlargement though clinical correlation is advised.                                                                       SESHa"
"INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  Question of cardiac tamponade. 
FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views are compared to the AP semi-upright view dated [**8-1**].  There is stable cardiomegaly.  Pulmonary vessels are no longer congested.  The mediastinum is unchanged.  The azygos vein remains prominent, which suggests high systemic venous pressure.  There is partial left lower lobe atelectasis.  There is a small left pleural effusion.  The visualized osseous structures are unchanged.  Multiple dilated bowel loops with air-fluid levels are noted.  This is likely related to the recent kidney transplant. 
IMPRESSION: 
1) Stable cardiomegaly.  Pericardial effusion cannot be ruled out. 
2) Resolution of pulmonary vascular congestion.  Persistent systemic venous congestion. 
3) Small left pleural effusion."
"INDICATIONS:  Status post spinal fusion.  Assess for a nasogastric tube placement. 
CHEST, SEMI-UPRIGHT AP PORTABLE:  Comparison is made to the prior day.  There has been revision of prior fusion hardware along the upper thoracic and lower cervical spines, not well characterized here.  The patient is intubated. 
The tip of an endotracheal tube lies 6 cm above the carina, at the thoracic inlet. There is a Swan-Ganz catheter terminating in the main pulmonary artery. The nasogastric tube terminates in the lower esophagus.  It should be advanced into the stomach for optimal positioning. 
There are no effusions.  The lungs are clear.

CHEST, AP:  Comparison is made to the prior film obtained 4 hours earlier. Again noted is a left-sided subclavian central venous catheter, terminating in the SVC.  Also noted is the ET tube, with the tip about 3.4 cm above the carina.  NG tube is also visualized.  There is no significant change in the retrocardiac opacity, consistent with a left lower lobe collapse/consolidation.  Also noted is opacity within the right middle lobe. There is evidence of bilateral pleural effusion, which demonstrate mild interval improvement when compared to the prior study.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The visualized and osseous structures are within normal limits. 
IMPRESSION:  1)  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Persistent bilateral pleural effusion. 
2)  Unchanged right middle lobe consolidation and retrocardiac consolidation/collapse."
"Images were obtained in coronal and sagittal planes through the anterior fontanelle and through a mastoid approach.  The study is compared with the examination of [**2188-12-11**].  Again noted is evidence of residual clot within the right lateral ventricle.  There is interval decrease in the size of the left lateral ventricle and the third ventricle.  Overall the right lateral ventricle is unchanged.  Resistive indices without compression are 82 and 83 and with compression, 86 and 88, little changed from the prior study.  Fourth ventricle remains normal in size. 
IMPRESSION: 
Little change in the appearance of the clot within the right lateral ventricle.  Decrease in  dilatation of the left lateral ventricle.  LIttle change in resistive indices since [**2188-12-11**]."
"INDICATION: Respiratory distress upon extubation attempt. 
FINDINGS: AP supine view of the chest dated [**7-19**] at 4:24 PM is compared to AP view done earlier on [**7-19**]. There is an endotracheal tube 5.5 cm above the carina. The right IJ catheter, the NG tube, and the right sided chest tube remain in unchanged position. The heart and the mediastinum are unchanged. There is increased opacity in the right mid and lower lung zones, as well as persistent left perihilar opacity. This is consistent with worsening congestive heart failure. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax. Visualized osseous structures are unchanged. 
IMPRESSION: Worsening congestive heart failure. Endotracheal tube in satisfactory position."
"INDICATION:  45-year-old woman with infection and placement of PICC line. 
COMPARISON:  [**2115-5-25**]. 
SINGLE PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  An existing left subclavian central venous catheter is unchanged in location.  A new left PIC catheter has tip terminating in the mid SVC.  The cardiac size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Retrocardiac opacity is new since two days prior and most consistent with atelectasis.  Lungs are low in volume.  There is no focal consolidation, pulmonary vascular congestion, or pleural effusion. Midline surgical staples are unchanged.  Patient is status post CABG with intact median sternotomy wires.

"CHEST, [**2151-2-15**]: 
INDICATION:  Gallbladder cancer.  S/P PA catheter placement.  Check position. 
FINDINGS:  A single AP supine view.  Comparison dated [**2151-2-11**].  The right IJ pulmonary artery catheter tip extends from the right pulmonary artery upward, possibly into the upper lobe branch.  The NGT is visualized as far as the left diaphragm but cannot be identified below this, possibly due to under- penetration.  The heart again shows left ventricular enlargement and there is unfolding of the aorta.  The pulmonary vessels are unremarkable.  The lungs appear clear.  No infiltrates or effusions are identified. 
IMPRESSION:  Lines probably in satisfactory position but tips poorly visualized.  LV enlargement without failure.  No other significant abnormality."

IMPRESSION: 
1)  Stable chest radiograph, with persistent retrocardiac opacity which could represent any combination of atelectasis, effusion and pneumonia. 2) Stable pulmonary vascular congestion. 
RLE"
"STUDY:  Portable abdomen, [**2102-4-14**]. 
CLINICAL HISTORY:  81-year-old woman with history of multiple abdominal surgeries, now with nausea and vomiting.  Evaluate for obstruction. 
FINDINGS:  There is a single dilated loop of bowel in the mid lower abdomen. This likely represents small bowel.  There is a paucity of bowel gas in the remainder of the abdomen. There is no free intraabdominal air.  Bilateral total hip arthroplasties are also seen. 
IMPRESSION: 
Nonspecific bowel gas pattern with dilated loop of bowel in the mid abdomen, likely small bowel and a paucity of bowel gas throughout the remainder of the abdomen.  Underlying obstruction cannot be excluded."
"INDICATION:  Metastatic gallbladder cancer. 
COMPARISON:  CT of [**2167-11-20**]. 
FINDINGS: Nine fluoroscopic spot films were obtained during endoscopy performed by gastroenterologist staff.  The initial film shows presence of a plastic stent within the region of the common bile duct.  The stent was removed and opacification of the common biliary tree was performed.  There is an irregular, malignant-appearing stricture to the distal common bile duct with massive dilatation of the biliary tree proximal to this.  The final film shows placement of a metallic stent past the malignant-appearing stricture. 
IMPRESSION: Irregular stricture to distal common bile duct with massive common and intrahepatic biliary dilatation.  Placement of metallic common bile duct stent."
"INDICATION:  [**Age over 90 **] y/o male with respiratory failure. 
FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to radiographs from [**2128-2-17**] and [**2128-2-16**]. 
An endotracheal tube terminates in satisfactory position approximately 3 cm above the carina.  An NG tube passes beneath the diaphragm.  A left subclavian Swan-Ganz catheter terminates within the region of the main pulmonary artery. The heart size and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  There has been interval development of massive subcutaneous gas.  Pulmonary edema and consolidation within the left lower lobe are unchanged compared to the previous examination.  No pneumothorax is seen. 
IMPRESSION: 
1)  Interval development of a large quantity of subcutaneous gas within the chest wall and neck. 
2)  Unchanged appearance of diffuse pulmonary edema and consolidation within the left lower lobe."
"INDICATION:  57-year-old woman with lethargy and hypotension, assess for infection. 
COMPARISON:  None. 
UPRIGHT FRONTAL CHEST:  There is opacification of the majority of the left lung, with scattered regions of lucency, without significant mediastinal shift. The heart and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  There is a right- sided PICC with its tip in the superior vena cava.  Multiple surgical clips are seen in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen with multiple foci of lucency and density in this region appearing contiguous with the chest findings. The right lung appears clear. 
IMPRESSION:  Extensive opacification of the left hemithorax with multiple small regions of lucency within it.  This finding could represent infection, but another consideration is a diaphragmatic hernia. Chest CT would be helpful, or comparison to prior studies."
"HISTORY: Shortness of breath. Assess for left lower lobe atelectasis versus pneumonia. 
CHEST, TWO VIEWS: Comparison is made to the portable AP chest of [**2147-9-22**]. The heart is enlarged. There is no overt CHF. There are small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, with associated atelectasis. Underlying consolidation in the left lower lobe cannot be excluded. The remainder of the lungs are grossly clear. There is a dual lead pacer with lead tips in the region of the RA and RV, unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. 
IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly with improvement in vascular congestion. Small bilateral effusions, left greater than right, with associated atelectasis. Underlying consolidation in the left lower lobe cannot be excluded."
"EXAMINATION:  AP portable chest. 
COMPARISON:  Prior CT dated [**2189-10-23**]. 
HISTORY:  Intubation and aspiration. 
FINDINGS: 
The ETT appears in good position.  However, the cuff appears slightly over- inflated.  There is mild cardiomegaly.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions.  Increased hazy densities are identified at bilateral lung bases, consistent with atelectasis.  However, given history of aspiration, aspiration pneumonitis can also produce similar appearance.  There also appears to be slightly increased density in the right upper lobe, which again may be consistent with aspiration or atelectasis.  There is a focal lucency in the right lower lung field, representing small amount of ventilated lung seen on the prior CT. 
IMPRESSION: 
Increasing bilateral lung base density, consistent with increasing atelectasis and/or aspiration pneumonitis. 
ETT placement, with tip in good position.  Slight overinflation of the endotracheal tube cuff."
"AP CHEST, 12:40 A.M., [**1-5**] 
HISTORY:  Thoracotomy and chest tube placement for empyema.  Intubation. Orogastric tube advanced. 
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**1-4**]: 
Orogastric tube ends in the distal stomach, ET tube at the thoracic inlet, right internal jugular or supraclavicular central venous line low in the SVC, at least three right pleural drains in stable placements.  Left lung is clear. Small right pleural effusion is stable, and right pneumothorax, if any, is minimal, nor is there any subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall."
"AP CHEST, 5:23 A.M., [**12-4**]. 
HISTORY:  C2 fracture.  Ruptured AAA repair.  Attempted line placement. 
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**12-1**] through 8: 
ET tube is in standard placement, and a nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.  Tip of the left subclavian line projects over the junction of the brachiocephalic veins.  Mild pulmonary edema has worsened and particularly greater opacification in the left hemithorax could be due either to aspiration or left pleural effusion layering posteriorly.  There has been no change in the cardiomediastinal contour since [**12-1**] when chest CT scan showed a tortuous but non-aneurysmal thoracic aorta and at least moderate cardiomegaly.  No pneumothorax present."
"AP CHEST, 8:18 P.M., [**6-5**] 
HISTORY:  Fever, question pulmonary infection. 
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**6-3**] and 4:17 a.m. on [**6-5**]: 
Heterogeneous opacification at the base of the right lung could be atelectasis or small region of pneumonia, slightly more pronounced today than it was on [**6-3**].  Left lung is clear.  Pleural effusions are small if any and there is no pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are normal. 
ET tube tip at the upper margin of the clavicles is at least 4.5 cm above the carina, standard position.  Right jugular line ends in the mid SVC, right PIC line at the junction of the brachiocephalic veins and nasogastric tube in the mid portion of a nondistended stomach."
"REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Decreased saturation in a patient after CABG. 
Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**2168-6-28**]. 
The ET tube tip is about 7.5 cm above the carina, advance of 1.5-2.5 cm is recommended. 
The Swan-Ganz catheter was exchanged by a right internal jugular line terminating in superior SVC.  The sternotomy sutures are unchanged in appearance.  The cardiac silhouette is stable.  The mediastinal contour is unremarkable.  The lungs are clear.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The right chest tube terminates in unchanged position and the left subclavian line tip is at the junction of left brachiocephalic vein and SVC. 
IMPRESSION:  Stable post surgery appearance.  No radiological evidence of acute process."
"EXAM:  AP view of the pelvis and AP and lateral views of the right hip. 
CLINICAL INFORMATION:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with history of right hip pain and tenderness. 
COMPARISON:  None. 
FINDINGS:  AP view of the pelvis and AP and lateral views of the right hip were obtained.  No evidence of acute fracture or dislocation is seen.  The pubic symphysis and sacroiliac joints are maintained.  Degenerative changes at the visualized lower lumbar spine are noted.  There are coarse vascular calcifications in the pelvis.  A coarse 1 cm ovoid density to the right of midline in the pelvis may represent vascular calcification, fecal content or uterine calcification. 
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute fracture or dislocation."
"CHEST, PORTABLE 
INDICATION:  62-year-old woman status post right chest tube placement. 
CHEST, PORTABLE:  Comparison is made to a prior study of [**2192-1-3**].  A small right apical pneumothorax is present in the presence of a right-sided chest tube.  This has improved in comparison to the prior study as the basal component of the pneumothorax has resolved.  The pulmonary edema is unchanged and there is pleural effusion on the left and atelectasis in the left lower lobe, again stable in appearance.  An ET tube is not identified.  This likely has been removed.  Central venous line is in unchanged position.  NG tube also has been removed. 
IMPRESSION:  Small right apical pneumothorax, improved in comparison to the prior study.  Status post extubation with unchanged pulmonary edema, left pleural effusion and atelectasis of the left lower lobe."
"HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and fever. 
COMPARISON:  None. 
SEMI-UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  There is marked cardiomegaly with polychamber cardiac enlargement.  The aorta appears tortuous.  Pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits.  A density is seen superimposed on the heart, which may represent a possible retrocardiac density. Alternatively, this may just represent purely cardiac enlargement. No definite effusions or pneumothorax is present, however, the patient's head obscures full visualization of the apices. 
IMPRESSION: 
1)  Cardiomegaly without evidence of congestive heart failure. 
2)  Superimposed opacity over the cardiac silhouette, which may represent a retrocardiac process (including atelectasis or infection) or could just represent cardiac enlargement. A lateral view would be helpful in localizing this opacity and determining its significance. 
DFDdp"
"NONINVASIVE VENOUS STUDY OF THE RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY 
CLINICAL INDICATION:  Recently removed PICC line, now fever and hypotension. 
Imaging in the right neck shows a catheter within the jugular vein, which is patent and easily compressible and no clot is identified around the catheter. The right subclavian, axillary, and both brachial veins appear easily compressible and show normal color flow and pulse Doppler.  The basilic vein is distended with some echogenic partially occlusive clot, although some flow was seen around the clot.  This vein is only imaged in the proximal arm as there is bandaging over the antecubital region.  The cephalic vein was not identified. 
CONCLUSION:  No DVT, but extensive partially occlusive clot is seen in the right basilic vein."
"CLINICAL INDICATION:  Postop day 1 following orthotopic liver transplant. 
The liver transplant is normal in size, echogenicity and architecture.  Color flow and pulse Doppler assessment shows excellent flow in the hepatic veins, portal veins and hepatic arteries.  Resistive indices in the hepatic arteries range around 0.5.  There is good upstroke in the right and left hepatic arteries and full patency of all portal and hepatic veins.  The inferior vena cava also shows normal color flow and pulse Doppler characteristics.  There is a hyperechoic shadowing area beneath the right lobe that corresponds to an area of Surgicel.  A small right pleural effusion is noted, but there are no peritransplant fluid collections. 
CONCLUSION:  Satisfactory ultrasound on Doppler appearance of the recent liver transplant."
"EXAMINATION:  Abdomen. 
INDICATION:  Distention. 
Supine and erect views of the abdomen are presented.  These do not include the diaphragms; therefore, presence or absence of free air cannot be assessed. The bowel gas pattern is unremarkable.  There is a radiographic contrast in the right side of the bowel to the level of the hepatic flexure.  Catheter is seen overlying the left lower quadrant, probably external to the patient.  The bony structures are unremarkable for the patient's age.  Surgical clips are seen in the right upper quadrant probably secondary to prior cholecystectomy. 
IMPRESSION: 
Unremarkable bowel gas pattern with residual radiographic contrast in the right side of the colon."
"INDICATION:  Bilateral knee pain, left greater than right. 
COMPARISONS:  None. 
RIGHT KNEE:  No acute fracture or dislocation is seen.  There is severe patellofemoral compartment degenerative change, including joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis and hypertrophic bone formation.  Medial and lateral joint space compartments are grossly preserved with small marginal osteophytes.  No sizable joint effusion is seen.  Regional soft tissues appear unremarkable. 
LEFT KNEE:  There are no signs for acute bony injury.  There is severe femoral compartment osteoarthritis with loss of the joint space, hypertrophic osseous change and subchondral sclerosis.  Small marginal osteophytes are present in the medial and lateral compartments without significant joint space narrowing. No effusion.  Osseous mineralization is normal.  Regional soft tissues appear unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION:  Severe bilateral osteoarthritis in the patellofemoral compartments with minimal degenerative change in both medial and lateral compartments."
"INDICATION:  Ascites, history of cholangiocarcinoma. 
ULTRASOUND-GUIDED PARACENTESIS:  Written and informed consent were obtained. A preprocedure timeout was performed to confirm patient, side, and procedure. Preliminary images show a large amount of ascites and a heterogeneous liver. 
An area was selected in the left lower quadrant.  The area was draped and prepped in the usual sterile fashion.  Approximately 10 ml of subcutaneous lidocaine were administered for local anesthesia.  A 19 gauge [**Last Name (un) 655**] catheter was advanced into the peritoneal space, and 4.5 liters of cloudy fluid drained.  The fluid was sent for analysis per request of the primary team. The patient tolerated the procedure well, without immediate complications.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 653**], the attending radiologist, was present and supervising throughout. 
IMPRESSION:  Successful ultrasound-guided paracentesis."
"INDICATION:  18-year-old female with new PICC line placement. 
TECHNIQUE:  Single portable chest radiograph. 
COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph dated [**2156-9-17**]. 
FINDINGS:  In the interim from the prior radiograph, a right-sided PICC line has been removed and a left-sided PICC line has been placed.  The wire tip is at the level of the mid SVC.  There is no pneumothorax or other complication from placement.  The lungs are fully expanded and clear.  There is no pleural effusion.  The heart, mediastinal, hilar, and pleural surface contours are normal. 
IMPRESSION:  Interval removal of right PICC line.  Uncomplicated placement of left PICC line with wire tip at mid SVC."
"INDICATION:  HIV, 3 weeks of non-productive cough, low grade fever. 
Comparison is made to the prior chest x-ray on [**2176-6-1**] 
PA AND LATERAL CHEST:  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There has been marked interval improvement in the previously identified bilateral interstitial densities.  The lungs appear clear without effusion or consolidation.  There is a minimal amount of biapical pleural thickening or scarring.  The surrounding soft tissues and osseous structures are unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality."
"INDICATION:  Sepsis, status post left cephalic PICC line. 
COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray obtained on [**2182-5-2**]. 
FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a left-sided PICC line with the tip terminating in the right atrium.  This could be withdrawn approximately 3 cm.  A right internal jugular central venous line is in stable position.  The patient is status post extubation.  Median sternotomy wires and vascular clips are again identified.  There is persistent left lower lobe consolidation which is unchanged.  There is also evidence of mild failure. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Left-sided PICC line as described above. 2.  Continued left lower lobe consolidation. 3.  Mild failure."
"INDICATION:  Enterocutaneous fistula.  Clinical suspicion for CHF. 
A right PICC line remains in place, with the distal tip terminating in the proximal right atrium. 
Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable in the interval. 
There is a moderate-sized layering left pleural effusion which appears slightly increased in the interval.  A small right pleural effusion is not significantly changed.  Note is made of slight vascular engorgement and a subtle interstitial pattern. 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Apparent slight increase in size of moderate left pleural effusion, possibly due to changes in patient positioning rather than through change in size.  Comparison follow up upright film may be helpful for better comparison to older films. 
2.  Subtle interstitial pattern, likely due to congestive heart failure with interstitial edema.  Atypical pneumonia is also possible in the appropriate clinical setting. 
3.  PICC line terminates in proximal right atrium."
"INDICATION:  68-year-old with history of lung cancer. 
Comparison is made to the prior chest radiograph of [**2175-2-16**], and the prior CT chest of [**2175-9-14**]. 
PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Again seen is a complete opacification of the left hemithorax.  This patient is status post left thoracotomy.  Right lung appears clear.  The heart is unable to be evaluated secondary to the left hemithorax opacification.  Note is again made of post-surgical changes in the left ribs.  Otherwise the osseous structures are unremarkable.

HISTORY:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with fluid overload. 
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**11-21**] and 17: 
Right lung is entirely airless, function of worsening pleural effusion and atelectasis.  Severe opacification of the left lung has a distinctly nodular quality which could be due to collections of fluid in bullae, or multiple septic emboli.  Heart is enlarged but hard to assess because the right border is obscured by pleural and parenchymal abnormalities in the right chest. Right jugular line ends over the region of the low SVC.  No pneumothorax. 
Findings were discussed by telephone with the house officer caring for this patient at the time of dictation."
"AP CHEST, 2:55 A.M. ON [**3-27**] 
HISTORY:  Chest pain and pneumonia. 
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**3-25**] and 13: 
There has been no interval change since [**3-25**] in dense bilateral consolidation in the lower lung on the right and mid and lower lung on the left, shown by the intervening torso CT as bilateral lower lobe atelectasis and probable left upper lobe pneumonia.  Moderate left pleural effusion is slightly larger today.  Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion probably unchanged.  Heart size top normal.  Pulmonary vascularity is engorged, but this may be a function of supine positioning rather than cardiac dysfunction. ET tube, left PIC line, and nasogastric tube in standard placements respectively.  No pneumothorax. 
Fracture of proximal left humerus substantially distracted, and not clearly present before [**3-20**]. 
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 612**] was paged."

COMPARISON:  Most recent radiograph dated [**2120-9-5**].  Note is made of CT chest dated [**2120-10-18**]. 
FINDINGS:  Multiple bilateral nodular densities are consistent with known widespread pulmonary metastasis and adenopathy.  However, there is increased density in the right peripheral mid lung, not well located on the lateral view, but not definitely explained by metastatic involvement and concerning for pneumonia.  The cardiac silhouette is stable.  There is no pneumothorax or pulmonary edema. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Right peripheral mid lung opacity, concerning for pneumonia. 
2.  Innumerable metastatic nodules and bulky mediastinal adenopathy, probably unchanged from recent CT of the chest. 
These findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 20710**] at 5:30 p.m. on [**2120-11-13**]."
"INDICATION:  Change in mental status, status post intubation.

COMPARISONS:  [**2198-5-3**]. 
FINDINGS: The endotracheal tube is seen with tip at the level of the carina. Sternal wires are again demonstrated consistent with prior sternotomy. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  There has been interval decreased haziness around the perihilar region.  A right sided pleural effusion is seen. This has also decreased in the interval.  There is loss of the left hemidiaphragm, consistent with left basilar atelectasis vs. infiltrate. 
IMPRESSION: 
1) Malpositioned endotracheal tube with tip at the carina. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was informed of these findings. 2) Improved congestive heart failure. 3) Improved right pleural effusion."
"INDICATION:  CHF, diabetic ketoacidosis, acute on chronic renal failure. Assess for infiltrates, hyper-hydration. 
FINDINGS:  AP and left lateral upright views.  Comparison study dated [**3-10**], [**2110**].  The heart shows slight left ventricular enlargement.  There is evidence of prior CABG surgery with sternal sutures and cardiovascular clips noted.  The pulmonary vessels are slightly prominent throughout both lungs and there is evidence of small bilateral pleural effusions.  Vascular detail is somewhat blurred at the bases.  These findings are not significantly changed since the prior study of one day earlier. 
IMPRESSION:  The appearances could be due to early left ventricular decompensation but might also be the result of hyper-hydration associated with renal failure.  Further followup studies are recommended to assess change."

"INDICATION:  71-year-old man, followup evaluation of strep pneumonia. 
COMPARISON:  [**2165-5-12**]. 
SINGLE SUPINE VIEW OF THE CHEST AT 4 A.M.:  The left heart border and costophrenic angle are excluded from this examination.  The endotracheal tube terminates 6.5 cm from the carina. An NGT extends off the bottom of the film, and its termination is not seen. The single-lead pacemaker remains overlying the right hemi-thorax, although the lead is not fully visualized. 
In the 24 hours since the prior radiograph, there has been increase in diffuse, bilateral opacity consisting of layering bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary edema.  The pulmonary vasculature is engorged.  The heart remains enlarged. 
IMPRESSION:  Interval worsening of moderate pulmonary edema (both central and diffuse).  Bilateral pleural effusions."
"HISTORY:  Fever in smoker who is HIV positive with resection of brain tumor. 
Heart size is normal.  There are focal ill defined areas of density in the left upper and left lower lobes, and to a lesser extent at the right lung base, consistent with multifocal pneumonia, new since the prior study of [**2150-1-28**].  Cannot rule out small effusion in the left posterior costophrenic sulcus.  On the lateral view a small focal area of density is noted in the cisternal region in the anterior cardiophrenic angle, possibly due to a further small area of consolidation in the lingula. 
IMPRESSION:  Probable multifocal pneumonia.  Correlate clinically and with follow up after therapy to re-evaluate."
"PROCEDURE:  AP portable chest. 
INDICATION:  Quadriplegic with new acute renal failure, fever. 
Comparison is made to the prior exam of [**2146-8-21**]. 
FINDINGS:  Allowing for differences in technique, the cardiomediastinal borders are unchanged.  Left internal jugular central venous line has been removed, and right-sided PICC line has tip in good position in the distal SVC. Tracheostomy tube is in good position.  There is some improvement to bilateral small pleural effusions and pulmonary edema, with persistent left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity.  No pneumothorax.

COMPARISON:  The chest radiograph from [**2157-1-27**]. 
FINDINGS:  Five fluoroscopic images are provided which show symmetrical movements of both diaphragms after patient inhales through the nostrils.  The diaphragmatic movements were appropriate with no evidence of paradoxical movements.  There is mild elevation of the right diaphragm and persistent blunting of the right costophrenic angle as seen in the prior chest radiograph. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Sniff test showing appropriate symmetric movements of both diaphragms with no evidence of paradoxical movements. 2.  Persistent mild elevation of the right diaphragm and blunting of the right costophrenic angle."
"HISTORY:  Motor vehicle accident. 
A single lateral view of the cervical spine demonstrates normal alignment from the skull base through C7-T1.  No fracture is identified.  Evaluation of the prevertebral soft tissues is limited due to the presence of an endotracheal tube and a nasogastric tube.  The latter is coiled within the hypopharynx. 
A single supine view of the chest demonstrates normal cardiac and mediastinal contours.  The lungs are clear.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.  Both lung apices are excluded from the film.  No fracture is identified. 
A single AP view of the pelvis demonstrates no fracture or dislocation.  The soft tissues are unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of traumatic injury.  Please see entire report."
"STUDY:  Left wrist three views [**2109-1-15**]. 
HISTORY:  79-year-old man with septic left wrist and pseudogout. 
FINDINGS:  There are no signs of acute fractures or dislocations.  The patient has abnormal widening of the scapholunate interval measuring 5 mm consistent with SL ligament injury.  There are degenerative changes seen at the first MCP, first CMC, and triscaphe joint.  A well-corticated density is seen adjacent to the ulnar styloid likely sequela of prior old trauma or an accessory ossicle.  There is some faint chondrocalcinosis seen in the radiocarpal joint.

"INDICATION:  Chest pain. 
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph at [**2174-12-5**] at 15:29 and CT torso at 11:47. 
PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with mild unfolding of the thoracic aorta. Nodular opacities noted within both lung bases as better seen on the CT performed the same day are somewhat obscured due to the presence of new patchy bibasilar airspace opacities.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Contrast material within the colon is partially imaged. 
IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar airspace opacities, which are increased compared to the prior CT. While these may represent infectious or inflammatory findings, the rapid development suggests that these opacities may be related to pulmonary edema. Known nodules seen on prior CT torso performed the same day are obscured by the bibasilar airspace process.                                                                       DFDdp"
"PROCEDURE:  Chest portable AP. 
REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess Dobbhoff placement. 
The NG tube has been removed and replaced with a Dobbhoff catheter with its tip in distal stomach.  Atrial and ventricular pacing leads are unchanged and in satisfactory position.  Median sternotomy wires are intact.  A right thoracoplasty significantly reduces the right lung volume.  Obscuration of the left heart border and diaphragm has increased since the previous study, which is probably due to a combination of atelectasis and new consolidation. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  The gallbladder contains multiple gallstones. 
IMPRESSION: 
Satisfactory placement of new Dobbhoff catheter.  Interval worsening of left lower lobe atelectasis and probably consolidation.An early followup chest radiograph is recommended."

"CLINICAL INDICATION:  Massive splenomegaly and bilateral lower extremity swelling concerning for liver transplant rejection. 
After obtaining informed consent and performing a timeout confirming patient identity with name and date of birth, and after correcting low platelets with 3-unit platelet transfusion, an ultrasound-guided 18-gauge biopsy of the liver transplant was performed under local anesthesia.  A single pass obtained a good specimen and there were no complications during the procedure. Intravenous Demerol was used as adjunct for analgesia under the radiology nursing supervision. 
CONCLUSION:  Successful liver transplant biopsy."
"HISTORY:  Follow up study for cerebellar hemorrhage. 
TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT scan. 
FINDINGS:  Compared to the previous study of [**12-3**], there is no change in the extent of the relatively small medially positioned left cerebellar hemorrhage which extends to the 4th ventricle.  In the interval between studies, a ventricular drain has been placed, whose tip adjoins the septum pellucidum.  There is a small amount of gas adjacent to the frontal lobes. This collection presumably is post-surgical in origin. 
Finally, the drainage procedure has resulted in a mild decrease in supratentorial ventricular size but more impressively in the region of the temporal horns. 
CONCLUSION:  S/P drain placement with reduction in ventricular size as noted above."
"CHEST BILATERAL DECUBITUS VIEWS: 
There is free layering of the right and left pleural effusion. There is atelectasis in the left lower lobe and at the right lung base. The NG tube is not completely included on this film but follows a somewhat unusual course below the diaphragm and if clinically indicated, could be better evaluated with an abdominal film or contrast injection.

ET tube in standard placement, nasogastric tube ends in the stomach.  Midline and left pleural drains in place.  Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the right pulmonary artery.  Borderline pulmonary edema, bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right and small left pleural effusion, a common post-operative finding.  No pneumothorax."
"COMPARISON:  [**2183-3-24**]. 
INDICATIONS:  PICC line placement. 
The left PICC line is present, terminating just below the junction of the superior vena cava and right atrium.  A nasogastric tube coils within the stomach with sideport directed back towards the GE junction.  The lung volumes are low.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits allowing for this factor.  There is some crowding of vessels at the lung bases, but there are no frank consolidative changes. 
IMPRESSION:  Left PICC line just below the cavoatrial junction, as discussed with the IV nurse caring for the patient on the date of the study."
"PORTABLE CHEST [**2119-3-18**]

HISTORY:  COPD, CHF and respiratory failure. 
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**10-23**], 18th, and 19th: 
Small bilateral pleural effusions have increased.  Increasing opacification at the left lung base may be due in part to that pleural fluid, but is concerning for new consolidation due to atelectasis, aspiration or even pneumonia.  Upper lungs are grossly clear.  Heart is normal size.  Large pulmonary arteries and hyperlucency in lung apices suggest baseline COPD and elevated pulmonary artery pressure.  Transvenous right atrial and ventricular pacer leads are in standard placements, and nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view and a tracheostomy tube is in standard placement."
"HISTORY:  Hypoxic with respiratory failure.  S/P line change.  Assess placement. 
PORTABLE AP CHEST:  Comparison is made to exam of 10 hours earlier. 
The right-sided PA catheter has been removed.  There has been interval placement of a right-sided central venous catheter with the tip not well visualized, but likely overlying the distal SVC.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  The ET tube and NG tube remain in satisfactory position.  The heart and mediastinal/hilar contours are unchanged.  The lung fields are stable in appearance.  There are persistent small bilateral pleural effusions with left lower lobe collapse/consolidation. 
IMPRESSION: Tip of right-sided central venous catheter likely overlies the distal SVC.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Persistent small bilateral pleural effusions with left lower lobe collapse/consolidation."
"HISTORY:  Trauma, motor vehicle collision. 
SUPINE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Low lung volumes are present.  The mediastinum is slightly widened, but this may be secondary to poor inspiratory effort. The cardiac contour is within normal limits. The lungs are grossly clear. There are no effusions or pneumothorax noted. No fractures are seen. 
SUPINE AP VIEW OF THE PELVIS  The inferior aspect of the pelvis is excluded from this examination.  No fracture or dislocation is seen.  The hips and sacroiliac joints are preserved.  Sacrum appears intact. 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Low lung volumes.  Apparent widening of the mediastinum which may be due to poor inspiratory volumes. If there is clinical concern for a mediastinal injury, then chest CT is recommended for further evaluation. 
2.  No definite fracture or dislocation within the pelvis.                                                                       DFDdp"
"MRI OF THE BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST 
CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cyberknife protocol.  Metastatic NSCLC to brain. 
TECHNIQUE:  Post-contrast 3D MPRAGE sequence and sagittal, axial, and coronal post-contrast T1-weighted images were obtained through the brain. 
FINDINGS: 
The right cerebellar surgical cavity seen on [**9-11**] appears to have collapsed. In the region of the surgical defect, there is high signal intensity which could be a residual methemoglobin or enhancement.  No pre-contrast images are currently available.  No new enhancing lesion is seen. 
IMPRESSION:  In the operative bed, there is T1 hyperintense material, probably blood-breakdown products, although postoperative or neoplastic enhancement cannot be completely excluded."
"HISTORY:  45-year-old woman, intubated.  Evaluate for tube placement. 
TECHNIQUE:  Chest radiograph, single view. 
COMPARISON:  No prior. 
FINDINGS:  There is an endotracheal tube in place with tip 4.8 cm above carina.  There is diffuse airspace opacity of the right lung, likely due to aspiration, less likely asymmetric pulmonary edema. Mild RUL atelectasis noted with upward deviation of the minor fissure.  There is trace pleural fluid along the minor fissure. Left lung is clear.  There is no pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Hilar, mediastinal, and cardiac silhouettes are within normal limits.  Osseous structures appear normal. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Right lung opacity likely due to aspiration, less likely asymmetric pulmonary edema. 2.  Small amount of fluid in the minor fissure. 3.  Endotracheal tube in appropriate position."
"PORTABLE CHEST [**2127-11-30**]. 
CLINICAL INDICATION:  Orogastric tube placement. 
An orogastric tube is present, terminating below the diaphragm. 
Note is made of an endotracheal tube, central venous catheter, and multiple left-sided chest tubes.  Again demonstrated is a moderate sized partially loculated left pleural effusion.  Consolidative changes are seen in the left lung, most prominently within the left lower lobe.  A few patchy ill-defined areas of opacity are noted in the right lung as well. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Orogastric tube terminates below the diaphragm. 
2.  No significant interval change in moderate sized partially loculated left pleural effusion, with multiple chest tubes in place.  Consolidative pattern affecting the left lung to a greater degree than the right is suspicious for pneumonia."
"HISTORY: Multiple myeloma, fell today, complaining of pelvic pain. 
PELVIS, SINGLE AP VIEW. 
There is a focal spur and irregular contour to the right iliac crest anteriorly -- the appearance is most suggestive of prior trauma.  There is also a circular increased density superimposed over the lower portion of the right SI joint of uncertain significance -- could this represent a donor site for prior bone graft?  Two small metallic densities overlie the region of the pubic symphysis -- question foreign bodies or film artifact. 
No displaced fracture is identified about the pelvis.  No pubic symphysis or SI joint diastasis is seen. 
IMPRESSION:  No acute fracture or dislocaiton detected. See comment."

The Swan-Ganz catheter, endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, mediastinal and left chest drain have been removed since [**2124-8-28**].  There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis is stable since [**2124-8-28**].  A right internal jugular access sheath is unchanged in position, projected over the expected location of the brachiocephalic confluence.  Midline sternotomy wires are satisfactory in appearance.  The heart size is normal, allowing for projection. 
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumothorax after chest tube removal. Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis, that developed in the postoperative period is stable since [**2124-8-28**]."
"INDICATION:  TARGETED LIVER BIOPSY 
COMPARISON:  MRI [**2119-7-1**]. 
PROCEDURE:  Limited images of the liver demonstrate multiple lesions within the right hepatic lobe corresponding to the findings seen on the MRI of [**7-1**], [**2119**].  Lesion at the hepatic dome are heterogeneously hypoechoic.  The more inferior lesions are heterogeneously hyperechoic. 
The patient was hypotensive prior to the procedure.  This was discussed with the medical team and a decision was made to reschedule the procedure for the following day with anesthesia. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Multiple heterogeneously hypo- and hyperechoic liver lesions.  The differential including abscess versus necrotic tumor. 
2.  The procedure was not performed because of underlying hypotension.  See comments above.

"PORTABLE CHEST ON [**2134-4-10**] AT 10:38 
INDICATION:  CHF with brief desaturation. 
COMPARISON:  [**2134-4-7**]. 
FINDINGS: 
On the current study, I see pleural fluid layering out bilaterally where as on the prior, it seemed to only layer out on the left.  Moreover, on the left, it appears to layer out to a greater extent.  The findings are consistent with worsening pleural effusions.  Positioning differences could contribute.  No new consolidations, but the left hemidiaphragm is not well seen, and the retrocardiac pneumonia vs. atelectasis is likely.  There is no pneumothorax. 
The pulmonary vascular markings are somewhat poorly defined and in the upper right lung zone, where best visualized, appear slightly distended. 
IMPRESSION:  Worsening CHF with increasing pleural effusions and more distention of the pulmonary vessels."

"CHEST X-RAY 
INDICATION:  Patient with end-stage liver disease and status post liver transplantation.  Right-sided chest tube has recently been pulled.  For evaluation. 
TECHNIQUE:  Chest radiograph is performed. 
COMPARISON:  [**2117-8-5**]. 
REPORT: 
There is evidence of some right perihilar airspace consolidation which has progressed and represents a new finding from [**2117-8-5**].  Given the underlying immunosuppression, infection is the most likely etiology.  The heart is of normal size.  Some patchy ill-defined opacities are seen laterally in the region of the left upper lobe, partially obscured by tubing from the patient's oxygen mask. 
The osseous structures appear unremarkable. 
CONCLUSION: 
1. Airspace consolidation projected over the right hilar region consistent with pneumonia.

"HISTORY:  41-year-old male with renal stone status post shockwave lithotripsy. Evaluate for residual stone burden. 
COMPARISON:  [**2115-1-12**]. 
ABDOMEN, SUPINE:  There has been interval removal of the left nephroureteral stent.  There are multiple calcific densities overlying the right renal shadow, compatible with renal calculi.  Direct comparison to the prior study from [**2115-1-7**] is limited due to overlying stool on the prior study. Several calcific densities also overlie the left renal shadow, the largest measuring approximately 2 cm, also reflecting left renal calculi.

Also, similar are likely bilateral pleural effusions.  Diffuse increased interstitial markings are increased from the previous study. 
IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary edema, progressed from the comparison study. Effusions and atelectasis are unchanged."
"INDICATION: [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with recent left femur fracture, assess for aspiration. 
TECHNIQUE:  Video oropharyngeal swallow in conjunction with the speech and swallow division was performed under fluoroscopy guidance.  Multiple consistencies of barium were administered. 
FINDINGS:  There was aspiration with thin liquids.  There was a delayed oral phase and some residua in the valleculae which the patient was able to clear. 
There was evidence of dysmotility in the mid esophagus with reflux, likely consistent with presbyesophagus.  However, for further evaluation, a dedicated barium upper GI esophagram is recommended. 
IMPRESSION: Aspiration with thin liquids.  There is evidence of esophageal dysmotility. Barium esophagram is recommended for further workup."
"HISTORY: Fracture. 
The right mandible fracture seen on the CT exam of [**2197-3-25**], has been reduced with plate and fixation screws. There is lucency surrounding the left two fixation screws on the inferior fixation plate. Finding is nonspecific but can be seen with both hardware loosening and infection. Lung apices are clear. No acute fracture is identified. 
IMPRESSION: Status post ORIF of right mandible fracture. Lucency surrounding two left lateral screws of the inferior fixation plate is nonspecific but can be seen in both hardware loosening and infection. Clinical correlation is requested."
"INDICATION:  Line placement status post mitral valve repair, CABG, and PFO closure. 
COMPARISON:  [**2194-1-3**]. 
FINDINGS:  Patient is status post cardiac surgery with intact midline sternotomy wires, mitral valve prosthesis, and vascular clips.  Endotracheal tube terminates at the superior margin of the clavicle, right-sided IJ Swan-Ganz catheter terminates at the right main pulmonary artery, and orogastric tube loops within the stomach.  Three chest tubes are in the right chest.  Lung volumes are low with mild pulmonary vascular congestion and mild cardiomegaly.  Right-sided pleural calcifications are unchanged. 
IMPRESSION:  Expected postoperative appearance after cardiac surgery."

COMPARISON:  [**2104-4-19**] - [**2104-4-21**]. 
FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube remains in the mid trachea.  A left internal jugular catheter tip remains in the proximal left brachiocephalic vein.  A right-sided internal jugular catheter tip is in the mid SVC.  A right-sided PICC line is also in the mid SVC.  Diffuse peri-hilar central alveolar opacities in a ""bat [**Doctor First Name 2805**]"" or ""butterfly"" appearance are similar to prior exams.  However, there does appear to be improved aeration, particularly at the right base.  The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  There is a small right effusion. 
IMPRESSION:  Severe pulmonary edema with mildly improved aeration."
"AP CHEST 9:06 P.M. ON [**8-4**] 
HISTORY:  86-year-old man with core valve.  Check line placement and possible complications. 
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**8-3**]: 
The right transjugular device is temporary pacer lead, and not a vascular line, and passes into the distal right ventricle and out of view.  Supine positioning explains slight increase in pulmonary vascular caliber.  Heart size is normal. 
Hyperlucency projecting over the right upper abdominal quadrant could be pneumoperitoneum on the supine positioning. 
Findings were discussed by telephone with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 61541**] at 9:30 a.m., 2 minutes following recognition of the findings.  Atherosclerotic calcification in both carotid systems is heavy."
"HISTORY:  81-year-old female, with acute respiratory distress, rule out fracture. 
TECHNIQUE: Chest radiograph, portable AP view. 
COMPARISON:  No prior comparison available. 
FINDINGS: There is a well defined area of opacity with a horizontal superior edge, which does not silhouette out the right heart border. There is a meniscus laterally. The findings are suggestive of loculated effusion.  The remaining aerated lungs are otherwise clear. There is no pleural effusions in the left lung.  There is no evidence of displaced rib fracture or pneumothorax. 
IMPRESSION:  No displaced rib fracture.  Right lower hemithorax opacity with unusual configuration.  Findings do not suggest atelectasis.  There may be a component of pleural effusion, and if present, likely loculated.  Recommend repeating the study with PA, lateral and decubitus views, if patient can tolerate."
"TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view. 
INDICATION:  Intracranial hemorrhage, status post NG tube placement.  Verify tube position. 
FINDINGS: 
An OG tube is identified reaching far below the diaphragm.  Although the ultimate tip is not included in the image field, the line appears to point towards the pylorus.  Available for comparison is a previous similar study of [**2144-3-3**].  The density previously observed and indicative of lingular density is not seen anymore and has resolved.  As before, there is status post sternotomy with multiple ruptured cerclage wires and the presence of surgical clips in the mediastinal indicative of previous bypass surgery.  The lung fields are clear and no congestive pattern is present. 
IMPRESSION: 
Appropriate position of orogastric tube."

Again noted are diffuse alveolar and nodular opacities with unchanged with a moderate right pleural effusion. 
IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change."
"HISTORY:  Acute onset of shortness of breath and desaturation.  Evaluate for interval change. 
PORTABLE CHEST 
Comparison made to [**7-13**] CT and [**7-16**] chest radiograph.  No significant interval change is noted in size and appearance of large right pleural effusion causing compressive atelectasis of a part of the right middle and right lower lobes.  Mild-to-moderate left lower lobe atelectasis persists with slightly diminished visualization of left hemidiaphragm suggesting increased atelectasis or slight differences in technique.  Prominence of the perihilar vessels and interstitial markings is not significantly changed. No pneumothorax or new infiltrates are identified. 
IMPRESSION: 
No significant internal change in size of right effusion and adjacent atelectasis with persistent mild CHF.  No new infiltrates or pneumothorax."
"LAPAROSCOPIC ULTRASOUND OF THE LIVER 
CLINICAL INDICATION:  For planned hand-assisted resection of left lateral segment mass.  Scan to assess for any residual disease. 
Laparoscopic ultrasound of the liver was performed after the exophytic left lateral segment mass has been resected.  The entire liver has nodular architecture.  In segment [**Doctor First Name **], a 1.3-cm solid echogenic and hypervascular nodule is identified.  In addition, a 5-mm nodule is seen in segment II and an 8-mm nodule in segment III, both of which are also hyperechoic and show increased vascularity.  No nodules were identified in the right lobe, although access was somewhat limited.

HISTORY:  Fever.  Intubated. 
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**12-10**] through 26: 
Pulmonary edema developed between [**12-10**] and [**12-11**], accompanied by at least a small if not larger bilateral pleural effusion.  There is improvement by [**12-12**], leaving relatively pronounced consolidation at the left lung base and right upper lung, raising the possibility of pneumonia. Those findings are unchanged except for probable increase in small left pleural effusion.  It should be noted that mitral regurgitation can give more pronounced right upper lobe edema, simulating pneumonia. 
ET tube and a right supraclavicular vascular introducer are in standard placements, unchanged, and a nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.  No pneumothorax."
"CHEST 1 VIEW PORTABLE:

HISTORY:  69-year-old woman with lethargy. 
FINDINGS:  Single bedside AP examination labeled ""upright"" with patient rotated and leaning to her left, and no comparisons.  There is some LV enlargement and slight pulmonary vascular congestion with Kerley B lines and right pleural effusion, representing CHF.  However, there is more asymmetric streaky opacity involving, particularly, the right lung base; pneumonic infiltrate in this region cannot be excluded.  Also noted are atherosclerotic changes involving the thoracic aorta, diffuse osteopenia with loss of height of several thoracic vertebrae as well as scoliosis, probable pleural calcification and gas-distended bowel loops in the upper abdomen. 
IMPRESSION:  CHF, with asymmetric and focal findings involving the right lung; while these may represent ""asymmetric"" pulmonary edema, pneumonic infiltrate cannot be excluded."

INDICATION:  Increased WBC and increasing O2 requirement. 
FINDINGS: 
An ETT is seen with tip 5.7 cm above the carina.  Slight increased density at the left lower lung field probably is a conglomerate of pulmonary vessels and costal cartilage.  This area should be monitored on subsequent followup for possible airspace evolution.  Pulmonary vascular markings are normal.  The heart size and mediastinal contours are normal.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified. 
IMPRESSION: 
Slight increased density at the left lower lung field for which a followup is suggested to see if this blooms into an obvious airspace finding."

"INDICATION:  Multiple chest tubes status post right subclavian line placement. 
COMPARISON:  Same date at 12:46 a.m. 
TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable supine chest. 
FINDINGS:  Tracheostomy tube again seen with tip terminating 4.4 cm from carina.  There has been interval placement of a right subclavian venous access catheter with tip at SVC/RA junction.  The previously present right-sided pneumothorax is slightly decreased in size.  Bilateral chest tubes and peritoneal drains in unchanged position.  Heart size and mediastinal contours, as well as bibasilar atelectasis, appear unchanged.  Multiple right-sided rib fractures again noted. 
IMPRESSION:  Right subclavian venous access catheter with tip at SVC/RA junction.  Decreased size of right-sided pneumothorax.  Otherwise, stable radiographic appearance of the chest."
"REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of patient four days after esophagectomy. 
Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**2110-8-8**]. 
The bilateral chest tubes are in unchanged position.  The right internal jugular line tip terminates at the level of mid SVC.  The NG tube project over the mediastinum with its tip projecting over the level of the hiatus.  There is decrease in the size of right perihilar opacity and at least no change or possible small increase in size of the left perihilar haziness.  No sizeable pleural effusion is identified.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Subcutaneous emphysema of the right chest wall is unchanged. 
IMPRESSION:  Improvement of right and left perihilar airspace opacities which may represent atelectasis.  Persistent left retrocardiac consolidation might represent infectious process such as pneumonia."
"INDICATION: Evaluate for bleed status post MVA. 
TECHNIQUE: Axial images through the brain were obtained after the chest/ abdomen trauma CT with intravenous contrast. 
FINDINGS: The ventricles cisterns and sulci are normal in appearance. There is no shift of normally midline structures. There is no evidence of mass effect. No enhancing lesions are identified. Osseous structure demonstrate no evidence of fracture. The visualized paranasal sinuses are clear. Evaluation for hemorrhage is limited due to the contrast. 
IMPRESSION: No mass effect, hydrocephalus or abnormal enhancement. No evidence for large intr or extra-axial hematoma. However, a subtle intra or extra-axial hemorrhage cannot be excluded due to presence of contrast. If clinically indicated a repeat study without contrast may be of help."

HISTORY:  Respiratory distress and endotracheal tube placement. 
FINDINGS:  A single portable view of the chest was performed, and there are no prior studies for comparison.  There is an endotracheal tube in place with the tip approximately 4 mm above the carina.  The lung volumes are low, and there are bilateral, diffuse granular opacities in keeping with surfactant deficiency disease.  Multiple air bronchograms are appreciated bilaterally. There are no pneumothoraces and no pleural effusions.  The cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  The visualized bowel gas pattern in the upper abdomen is normal. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Endotracheal tube is 4 mm above the carina. 
2.  Diffuse granular opacities within the lungs suggestive of surfactant deficiency disease."
"HISTORY: Left knee pain after fall. No fracture on x-ray. 
COMPARISON:  There is no recent imaging of the left knee in our system for comparison. There is a recent radiograph of the contralateral knee. 
TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar proton density and T2 weighted MR imaging of the left knee. 
FINDINGS: 
Examination is somewhat limited by motion. There is a moderate joint effusion. Allowing for technique, the menisci and ligaments of the knee appear intact. There is advanced degeneratiave change with multicompartmental cartilage loss and large osteophytes. There is no abnormal bone marrow edema. There is focus of increased T2 and STIR signal in the tibial metaphysis which has an appearance suggesting it may represent a small chondroma. 
IMPRESSION:  Advanced tricompartmental degenerative changes. Possible small enchondroma proximal tibia."
"INDICATIONS:  81 year old woman with hernia and              fistula. Temperature to 101, abdominal pain. 
CHEST PORTABLE:  comparison is made to prior study of [**2107-11-26**].  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.

Clinical correlation is advised.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No acute bony abnormality."
"PROCEDURE:  Chest portable AP. 
REASON FOR EXAM:  Post-CABG, removal of chest drain.  Evaluate for pneumothorax. 
FINDINGS:  Since the previous chest radiograph, the patient has been extubated, the Swan-Ganz catheter has been replaced with an internal jugular introducer catheter and the left chest drain and mediastinal drains have been removed with no interval development of a pneumothorax. 
A well demarcated opacification in the right lower lobe could be due to right lower lobe collapse or possibly a new small right pleural effusion, a tiny left pleural effusion is also new.  No new consolidation or pneumothorax. Median sternotomy wires are intact.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged and normal. 
IMPRESSION: 
New right lower lobe collapse or pleural effusion and new small left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax."
"INDICATION:  52-year-old woman with new central line. 
PORTABLE AP SUPINE CHEST:  Compared to [**2197-5-8**].  Endotracheal tube in place, 5.5 cm above the carina.  Right-sided IJ line with its tip in the mid SVC. Left-sided subclavian line, with its tip in the distal SVC.  Swan-Ganz catheter with its tip in the main pulmonary artery.  There is no pneumothorax. Heart size upper limits of normal, but unchanged.  The patient is somewhat rotated to the right.  There is no evidence of acute congestive heart failure. There is opacification of the right lower lobe, secondary to atelectasis and/or consolidation.  There is some elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. 
IMPRESSION: 1) Multiple lines and tubes in satisfactory position; no pneumothorax. 2) Opacification of the lateral aspect of the right lower lobe, consistent with atelectasis/consolidation."
"INDICATION:  Sigmoid volvulus, status post decompression with sigmoidoscopy. 
COMPARISONS:  One and a half hour earlier. 
SINGLE VIEW ABDOMEN, PORTABLE:  There has been interval placement of a tube through the rectum which terminates in the left upper quadrant, presumably within the sigmoid colon.  There has been interval decompression of the previously seen large dilated loop of large bowel, consistent with sigmoid volvulus seen on the previous exam.  Persistent arterial calcifications are seen.   No radiographic evidence of obstruction of free intraperitoneal air is seen. 
IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of sigmoid tube with decompression of previously seen sigmoid volvulus. 
These findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12092**] at the time of the study."
"AP PORTABLE CHEST, [**2101-12-3**] at 19:18 hours. 
HISTORY:  Attempted right internal jugular and left subclavian central lines. 
COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated earlier same day. 
FINDINGS:  There is an indwelling right subclavian approach central line stable in course and position.  No new central lines are identified.  A tracheostomy tube is likewise present and stable.  There is diffuse bilateral edema-like pattern consistent with ARDS.  This is relatively unchanged.  The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  No pneumothorax is evident.  There are moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions. 
IMPRESSION:  Apparent attempt at right internal jugular and left subclavian central lines with no pneumothoraces detected.  There is an indwelling right subclavian central line.  The patient is in ARDS"
"INDICATION:  63-year-old man with hypoxia. 
COMPARISON:  [**2201-10-25**]. 
FINDINGS:  A single portable AP chest radiograph was obtained.  There is a large left and small-to-moderate right pleural effusion.  There is diffuse bilateral hilar interstitial opacity.  An asymmetric opacity is seen in the central left upper lobe.  Median sternotomy wires, mediastinal clips and right lung chain suture are stable. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Large left and moderate right effusions and pulmonary vascular congestion suggest moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema. 2.  Asymmetric opacity in the central left upper lobe has somewhat of a ""butterfly"" appearance of pulmonary edema.  However, given the unilateral distribution, the presence of an additional consolidation or mass is likely. Repeat radiographs should be taken after diuresis.  Cross sectional imaging may be considered at that point if the diagnosis remains in doubt."
"INDICATIONS:  Pancreatic cancer. Tachypnea and hypoxia. 
PORTABLE AP CHEST:  A right PICC line has been placed in the interval and is in satisfactory position within the upper SVC. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable in the interval. An ill defined pulmonary nodule is again demonstrated in the right upper lobe.  There are small pleural effusions present which are new in the interval. 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  New small bilateral pleural effusions. 2.  Ill defined right upper lobe nodular opacity, which was also present previously.  This could potentially be due to an area of metastatic disease, but atypical infection is an important differential consideration, particularly if the patient is immune suppressed."
"PORTABLE CHEST [**2164-7-21**] 
CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Evaluate placement of ET tube, evaluate for pulmonary edema. 
COMPARISON STUDY:  [**2164-7-20**] 
FINDINGS: 
Patient is intubated.  The endotracheal tube terminates just below the thoracic inlet in appropriate position. 
Nasogastric tube terminates in the second in appropriate position.  There is diffuse reticular opacification.  The reticular pattern has somewhat diminished since the prior study consistent with improved congestive failure. Heart and mediastinum are normal.  There is a small left pleural effusion. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Improved congestive failure which is now mild in degree. 2.  ET tube and NG tube in satisfactory position"
"INDICATION:  Bilateral PEs.  Evaluate for upper extremity DVT. 
No prior examinations. 
BILATERAL UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND:  Due to the patient's neck brace, the internal jugular veins and the right subclavian vein were not able to be evaluated.  Doppler and [**Doctor Last Name 107**] scale examination of the left subclavian, bilateral axillary, bilateral brachial, and bilateral basilic and cephalic veins were performed.  Normal compressibility, augmentability and respiratory variation in flow.  No intraluminal thrombus was identified. 
IMPRESSION:  No deep venous thrombosis involving the right or left upper extremity.  Right subclavian vein and bilateral internal jugular veins were not able to be evaluated due to the patient's neck brace."
"INDICATION:  History of laxative abuse, abdominal pain, vomiting. 
COMPARISONS:  [**2133-2-8**]. 
ABDOMEN, SUPINE AND ERECT:  Scattered air-fluid levels are again seen in what appears to be the transverse and descending colon.  The amount of air within the colon has decreased in the interval.  There is no free intraperitoneal air.  No dilated loops of small bowel are seen to indicate obstruction. There is a paucity of gas in the rectum. 
IMPRESSION:  Interval decrease in size of dilation of the transverse and descending colon with persistent air-fluid levels.  An early or partial low colonic obstruction cannot be excluded."

IMPRESSION: 1.  New left-sided PICC terminates within the proximal right atrium and could be withdrawn 3.5 cm for more optimal placement. 2.  Stable cardiomegaly with apparent pulmonary vascular congestion.  This finding can be verified with followup chest radiograph."
"HEAD ULTRASOUND ON [**2110-4-7**] AT 8:20 HOURS: 
HISTORY:  26 weeker with known left IVH for follow-up. 
In follow-up to series of previous examinations, the most recent of which was [**2110-3-31**], ultrasound examination of the head again demonstrates liquifying clot within the left lateral ventricle extending into the temporal and occipital horns with mild dilatation, not significantly changed from prior examination. Again noted is chemical ventriculitis, unchanged.  The periventricular white matter is somewhat difficult to assess around the hemorrhage but appears fairly stable in appearance with no definite cystic change to suggest ischemia or PVL at this time.  The right lateral ventricle remains normal with no evidence SEH. 
IMPRESSION:  Stable follow-up left intraventricular hemorrhage with mild dilatation left lateral ventricle.  No definite periventricular ischemic at this time."
"INDICATION:  Fall and subdural hematoma on the ventilator, now with fever to 102. 
COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from [**2181-6-9**]. 
SINGLE PORTABLE AP UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  An endotracheal tube terminates 5.6 cm above the carina.  The nasogastric tube tip is seen overlying the stomach.  There is a surgical clip overlying the lower mediastinum which is unchanged.  There is cardiomegaly.  The aorta is mildly unfolded.  There is prominent pulmonary vasculature with the pulmonary vascular redistribution consistent with mild congestive heart failure.  There is also opacity in the right lower lobe as well as small right-sided pleural effusion. 
IMPRESSION:  Possible pneumonia in the right lower lobe with associated small right pleural effusion.  Mild congestive heart failure.  Cardiomegaly."
"INDICATION:  Pericardial window.  Clinical concern for increasing effusion. 
PA AND LATERAL CHEST:  Compared to the exam four days previously, there has been interval significant increase in the now large left pleural effusion. The possibility of post-op hemorrhage cannot be excluded.  If clinically indicated, a CT scan may be performed.  The heart is enlarged.  Increased density of the left lower lobe is likely related to atelectasis.  The right lung is clear. 
IMPRESSION:  Interval appearance of large left pleural effusion.  The possibility of post-op hemorrhage cannot be excluded.  These findings were communicated to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1331**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 77622**], in person.  A CT scan may be useful for further evaluation, if clinically indicated."
"INDICATION:  Pre-op for cardiac catheterization and surgery.  Rule out effusions or cardiovascular abnormalities. 
FINDINGS:  Standard PA and left lateral views. No prior comparison studies. The heart shows fairly marked enlargement involving all four [**Doctor Last Name 4473**].  The aorta is unfolded.  The pulmonary vessels appear prominent in all regions suggesting increased pulmonary blood flow.  This could reflect an atrial septal defect or other right to left shunt.  This should be clarified by the planned catheterization study or echocardiography evaluation. 
IMPRESSION:  Polychamber cardiomegaly, possibly related to a significant intracardiac right to left shunt."
"INDICATION:  Metastatic esophageal cancer and myeloma with pain radiating to the shoulder. 
COMPARISON:  None. 
TWO VIEWS CERVICAL SPINE:  On sagittal images, the skull base through the C7 vertebral body is visualized.  There is a large bridging osteophyte at C6-7. There is mild uncovertebral joint and facet joint arthropathy over multiple levels.  No acute fracture is identified.  There are no suspicious lytic lesions.  Visualized lung apices demonstrate a right-sided central venous catheter. 
IMPRESSION:  Large bridging osteophyte at C6-7 and multilevel degenerative changes."
"Two view chest [**2137-11-4**] compared to previous study of [**2136-12-26**]. 
CLINICAL INDICATION:  Amiodarone therapy. 
The heart is upper limits of normal in size with left ventricular configuration.  The aorta is tortuous and the pulmonary vascularity is normal.  An ICD remains in place with leads in the right atrium and right ventricle. There is a very subtle interstitial pattern with a basilar predominance, characterized by coarse reticulation.  This appears more conspicuous than on the previous study.  No confluent areas of consolidation are seen in either lung and there are no pleural effusions.  Degenerative changes are observed in the spine. 
IMPRESSION:  Subtle basilar interstitial disease, for which amiodarone lung toxicity should be considered.  Correlative high resolution CT imaging may be helpful if warranted clinically."
"PORTABLE CHEST [**2136-10-1**]. 
COMPARISON:  [**2136-9-29**] 
INDICATION:  Rising white blood cell count. 
An endotracheal tube has been advanced slightly in the interval, now terminating approximately 2 cm above the carina.  Central venous catheter remains in satisfactory position.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  There are multifocal areas of opacification involving the right upper and right lower lobes with relative sparing of the right apex, with an adjacent moderate right pleural effusion.  In the left lung, there has been interval worsening of left retrocardiac opacity as well as slight increase in size of the left pleural effusion. 
IMPRESSION:  Multifocal consolidation suggestive of multilobar pneumonia with associated bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left."
"HISTORY:  Trauma. 
TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast axial images through the cervical spine with multiplanar reformats. 
There is no acute fracture or malalignment, and no prevertebral soft tissue abnormality. There is multilevel disc, endplate, uncovertebral and facet joint degenerative change, most marked at C4/5 and C5/6, where there is mild- moderate canal stenosis, but the outline of the thecal sac is grossly unremarkable. Again demonstrated are sinus and mastoid opacification, and a 2sclerotic focus within the right skull base. Also noted is asymmetric prominence of the left nasopharyngeal soft tissues, incompletely characterized, which may relate to the mastoid inflammatory change. There is an enlarged right thyroid lobe. 
IMPRESSION: 1. No acute cervical spine fracture. 2. Multilevel degenerative changes, most marked at C4/5 and C5/6. 3. Asymmetric prominence of the left nasaopharyngeal soft tissues; this should be correlated clinically, and may warrant direct inspection. 4. Inflammatory sinus and mastoid disease."
"THIS IS AN ABDOMEN SUPINE AND ERECT. 
HISTORY:  Evaluate for small bowel obstruction in patient with abdominal pain and distention. 
Two views.  Comparison with [**2151-10-20**].  Multiple loops of dilated small bowel and multiple air-fluid levels in the upright view are again demonstrated.  No free air is seen.  Contrast material is again noted in the colon.  Soft tissues and bony structures are unremarkable in appearance as before.  A nasogastric tube has been inserted and terminates in the region of the stomach.  There is no other significant change. 
IMPRESSION:  Persistent small bowel dilatation.  Finding suggests small bowel obstruction."

COMPARISON:  Latest chest radiograph on [**2158-4-18**] at 7:54 hours. 
PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The dual-chamber pacemaker generator sends leads into the right atrium and right ventricle.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits, with unchanged markedly tortuous aortic arch.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Bilateral upper lobe calcified nodules, right worse than left, are compatible with post-tuberculosis exposure.  Biapical pleural thickening is mild.  No pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or new focal air-space consolidation is seen. 
IMPRESSION:  Pacemaker leads in the right ventricle and right atrium. Unchanged appearance of bilateral upper lobe calcified nodules compatible with post-tuberculosis exposure."
"TWO VIEW CHEST, [**2159-7-30**]. 
COMPARISON:  [**2159-7-29**]. 
INDICATION:  Chest tube clamping. 
A single chest tube remains in place in the right hemithorax.  Again, demonstrated is a right hydropneumothorax apically and laterally extending inferiorly to the level of the minor fissure.

"CLINICAL HISTORY:  82-year-old man with CHF and dyspnea.  Evaluate for CHF. 
COMPARISON:  [**2190-2-5**] and [**2181-6-19**]. 
FINDINGS:  A frontal upright view of the chest was obtained portably.  Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.  Increased perihilar opacity with pulmonary vascular engorgement in the setting of cardiac enlargement is likely due to mild congestive heart failure.  There is no substantial pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Increased opacity at the left lung base may represent asymmetric edema, but supervening infection cannot be excluded. Degenerative change at the acromioclavicular joint on the left is noted with joint space narrowing.

Since the prior film on [**2166-10-3**] there has been an increase in extent of the air-space opacity in the left lung and specifically now the left mid zone at the site of new opacification in addition to the previously demonstrated left lower lobe, retrocardiac opacity.  Cannot rule out associated small pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Left- sided dual-chamber pacemaker with atrial and ventricular leads in situ.  Left jugular CV line is in region of proximal left brachiocephalic artery.  No pneumothorax. 
IMPRESSION:  Increase in extent of consolidation in left lower lobe.  No pneumothorax."
"HISTORY:  Abdominal distention.  Obstruction. 
Two radiographs of the chest and abdomen are submitted.  The bilateral apices are excluded.  Assessment of the pulmonary parenchyma is markedly limited by technique and respiratory motion.  The cardiomediastinal contours are similar to that seen on [**2196-8-13**].  No pneumoperitoneum is evident.  There are multiple air-filled distended loops of small and large bowel.  Air is present within the stomach.  Air and stool are identified within the descending colon. Surgical staples project over the mid abdomen as does a radiopaque catheter. Single-lead cardiac pacemaker is again noted.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous. 
IMPRESSION: 
Nonspecific bowel gas pattern.  Close clinical followup is recommended."
"INDICATION:  73-year-old male with brain lesions consistent with metastatic disease vs. primary malignancy.  CT for stereotactic biopsy. 
COMPARISON:  [**2111-2-20**] MRI and CT of [**2111-2-21**]. 
FINDINGS:  Limited surgical planning enhanced study performed in a stereotactic frame which redemonstrates vasogenic edema surrounding a dominant enhancing right frontal lesion which measures 16 x 15 mm (2:39). There are several other smaller lesions, some with only faint enhancement, better characterized on the recent MR.  Remainder of the CT is stable compared to recent others. 
IMPRESSION:  Surgical planning study in stereotactic frame, redemonstrating findings on earlier study without significant change."
"TYPE OF STUDY:  Barium esophagram. 
STUDY DATE:  [**2113-9-20**]. 
COMPARISON:  Barium esophagram from [**2113-5-31**]. 
INDICATION:  57-year-old man status post laryngectomy and radiation therapy, now having trouble swallowing. 
FINDINGS: Roughly 3-4 cm long segment of upper esophagus demonstrates narrowing and associated spasm. The maximum diameter in this region was roughly around 1 cm. Liquid barium is able to pass freely, however, the barium tablet was retained in the hypopharynx for more than 10 minutes. The rest of the esophagus appears normal in contour, caliber, mucosal pattern, and motility. The lower esophageal sphincter opens appropriately with normal passage of barium. A slight sliding hiatal hernia with no reflux was noted. 
IMPRESSION:  Roughly 3-4 cm long segment of narrowing with associated spasm during swallow was noted in the upper esophagus as described above. ."
"CHEST 
HISTORY:  Status post chemotherapy for esophageal cancer, pre-op for CABG. 
Two views.  Comparison with [**2129-10-19**].  There is no evidence for pulmonary vascular congestion, and there are small-to-moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions.  There is increased density at the lung bases, which may reflect compressive atelectasis.  An underlying basilar infiltrate cannot be excluded. The heart is at the upper limit of normal in size.  The aorta is mildly tortuous and calcified.  Mediastinal structures are otherwise unremarkable. The bony thorax is grossly intact. 
IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral pleural effusions. Bibasilar density consistent with compressive atelectasis.  A small basilar infiltrate cannot be excluded."
"INDICATION:  77-year-old woman with lower urine output over 24 hours. Evaluate for obstruction/hydronephrosis. 
COMPARISON:  We have no prior studies available for comparison. 
RENAL ULTRASOUND:  The right kidney measures 11.7 cm.  The left kidney measures 10.5 cm.  Both are slightly echogenic.  Neither demonstrate any evidence of hydronephrosis.  There are bilateral simple-appearing cysts in both kidneys.  A largest on the right measures roughly 3 mm and is in the interpolar region.  A largest on the left measures 3.8 cm and is in the upper pole.  A trace amount of fluid is seen between the liver and the right kidney, in [**Location (un) 2997**] pouch, of uncertain significance. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  No evidence of hydronephrosis. 2.  Slightly echogenic kidneys consistent with medicorenal disease. 3.  Bilateral simple-appearing renal cysts."
"TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view. 
INDICATION:  Tachycardia, worsening O2 requirement, evaluate for increasing CHF. 
FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of [**2112-1-18**].  The position of a left-sided PICC line is unchanged.  There exists moderate degree of perivascular haze and bilateral plate atelectasis on the bases, but no new parenchymal infiltrates have developed.  Comparison of the vascular pattern suggests that the previously described moderate CHF has improved slightly.  No pneumothorax is present and no evidence of pleural effusion is present as the lateral pleural sinuses remain free. 
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of progressing CHF.  Comparison of study suggests mild regression of CHF during the last 24 hours."
"PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY 
CLINICAL INDICATION: 57 year old woman with diabetes and metastatic colon cancer.  Now with hyperglycemia. 
A single AP upright portable radiograph of the chest was obtained and compared to the  next prior study dated [**2200-1-23**]. 
FINDINGS: A central venous line is again identified with tip stable in position.  The heart size and  mediastinal contours are also stable.  The pulmonary vascularity appears normal with no evidence of left heart failure. There is stable elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with possible scarring vs atelectasis in the left lower lobe.

There is no evidence of pleural effusion. 
IMPRESSION: 
Right-sided PICC catheter within the mid to distal SVC.  No pneumothorax."
"CHEST X-RAY FROM [**10-2**]. 
HISTORY:  Pneumonia.  Evaluate tube position. 
An AP supine chest radiograph shows air space consolidation, most notable in the right upper and right lower lobe with associated right pleural effusion. Some streaky consolidation is seen in the left retrocardiac region.  Overall, the appearance is very similar to that seen on [**9-29**] chest radiograph. The nasogastric tube and right subclavian central venous catheters are in unchanged positions.  The endotracheal tube tip is approximately 3 cm above the carina.  Calcification is seen at both carotid bifurcations, the thoracic and abdominal aorta, and the splenic artery. 
CONCLUSION: 1.  No significant radiographic change in predominantly right-sided alveolar consolidation as well as right pleural effusion. 2.  Endotracheal tube approximately 3 cm above carina. 3  Atherosclerosis."
"PORTABLE CHEST 
CLINICAL INDICATION:  64-year-old woman with a V-Fib arrest and respiratory failure status post intubation.  Evaluate endotracheal tube placement and evolution of pulmonary process. 
FINDINGS:  A single portable image of the chest was obtained and compared to the prior examination dated [**2175-2-24**].  There is a new temporary pacing wire within the expected region of the right ventricle.  The remaining supporting wires are stable and in satisfactory position.  Left basilar atelectasis is again noted associated with a small pleural effusion.  There is likely a small right pleural effusion as well.  Bilateral prominent interstitial markings are again noted.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. 
IMPRESSION:  Stable examination as above."
"CT OF THE HEAD: 
CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient with new left cerebral vasospasm, assess for interval change. 
TECHNIQUE:  Axial images of the head were obtained without contrast. Comparison was made with the previous CT of [**2172-8-2**]. 
FINDINGS:  Since the previous CT, there has been evolution of previously noted hemorrhagic areas contusions in the both frontal and left parietal regions. There is also decrease in intraventricular blood identified.  Subtle subarachnoid hemorrhage is seen at the convexity region but has decreased from previous study.  There is no midline shift or hydrocephalus identified. 
IMPRESSION:  Interval evolution of hemorrhagic contusions identified on the previous CT of [**2172-8-2**].  No new areas of hemorrhage or mass effect seen. Subarachnoid hemorrhage."
"INDICATION: Postop thoracolumbar fusion for scoliosis and chest tube placement. 
No priors are available for comparison. 
PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: A right-sided chest tube is seen with the tip in the right lung apex. There is no pneumothorax and there are no focal areas of consolidation. The pulmonary vessels are within normal limits. Some thickening along the right lateral chest wall could represent a small amount of right pleural fluid. The right mediastinum is widened, more than would be expected for the amount of scoliosis seen. 
IMPRESSION: 1. Right-sided chest tube without pneumothorax. 2. Slightly widened right side of the mediastinum. This could relate to postoperative changes and follow-up radiographs are recommended."
"RIGHT KNEE, TWO VIEWS 
INDICATION:  Right knee pain and tenderness.  Status post fall. 
FINDINGS:  Abnormal contour of the medial tibial plateau with focal area of lucency may reflect a nondisplaced tibial plateau fracture.  Cross-table lateral is suboptimal.  No additional fracture or dislocation is seen. Vascular calcification is noted.  There is also chondrocalcinosis.  Soft tissues are otherwise unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION: 
Focal discontinuity in the medial tibial plateau could reflect a nondisplaced fracture.  Cross-table lateral view is suboptimal for evaluation of joint effusion.  If clinically appropriate, consider further evaluation with a full knee series or cross sectional imaging such as CT."
"COMPARISON:  [**2150-4-15**]. 
INDICATION:  Ventilated patient. 
Bilateral chest tubes remain in place.  There has been interval increase in size of a small left apicolateral pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable allowing for slight differences in lung volumes. Bilateral multifocal alveolar opacities have slightly progressed in the interval and are more prominent centrally than peripherally.  Numerous skeletal fractures are observed including multiple ribs, left clavicle, and right scapula. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Slight increase in left pneumothorax with chest tube in place. 2.  Slight worsening of multifocal alveolar opacities.  As the patient has been in the hospital greater than 10 days since the time of trauma, these are not consistent with contusions.  Rather, they may represent another process such as pulmonary edema, infection or ARDS."

HISTORY:  59-year-old man status post thoracotomy, evaluate for interval change. 
FINDINGS: 
A persistent small right basilar pneumothorax is noted with persistent three chest tubes in the right hemithorax.  Airspace disease at the periphery of the right lung slightly worsened on today's examination.  The patient is status post CABG with two broken sternal wires stable since the prior examinations. Stable right-sided dual-lead pacemaker is again seen. The left lung is clear. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Tiny  basal pneumothorax after the drainage of a right hemithorax collection with worsened airspace disease that could represent reexpansion edema, hemorrhage; however, pneumonia cannot be excluded with certainty."
"INDICATION:  Endotracheal tube placement. 
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph [**2163-3-22**] at 18:33. 
SUPINE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  An endotracheal tube is new in the interval, with tip terminating approximately 4.6 cm from the carina.  A nasogastric tube is also new since the prior study, with tip terminating below the diaphragm, beyond the inferior borders of the film.  Cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  There is mild pulmonary vascular engorgement.  More focal ill-defined opacities are also present in both lung bases, which are worse when compared to the prior study, and may reflect areas of atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous findings are seen. 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tubes in standard positions. 
2.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and probable bibasilar atelectasis.                                                                       DFDdp"
"INDICATION:  Bleeding gastric ulcer and severe headache, evaluate for hemorrhage. 
TECHNIQUE:  Routine noncontrast head CT. 
COMPARISON: Head MRI from [**2201-2-4**]. 
FINDINGS:  There is no intra or extra-axial hemorrhage.  There is no mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.  There is stable enlargement of the ventricles.  There is decreased attenuation in the periventricular white matter which is consistent with chronic microvascular infarction.  Air fluid levels are identified in the bilateral maxillary sinuses and the sphenoid sinus.  There is also mucosal thickening of the ethmoid sinus.  No fractures are identified. 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  No evidence for hemorrhage. 
2.  Findings consistent with sinusitis."
"INDICATION: Status post esophagectomy. Temperature spikes. 
COMPARISON: Study is compared to the study from [**10-23**]. 
There is evidence of a tube running through the neoesophagus, unchanged in position from previous.  A right sided chest tube is in situ.  No evidence of pneumothorax. There is evidence of bibasilar atelectasis/consolidation, which is slightly improved on the left side when compared to previously and is probably more prominent on the right side.  No definite airspace consolidation is identified. Although the right lower zone is a little more prominent than the left, this may reflect a degree of rotation.  A small posteriorly oriented effusion is identified. 
CONCLUSION: 
Persistent bibasilar atelectasis and/or consolidation, which has slightly improved on the left side and appears a little more prominent on the right. Otherwise, there is no definite airspace disease seen."
"INDICATION:  64-year-old male with dyspnea and elevated white blood cell.

FINDINGS:  The patient is status post CABG with median sternotomy.  There is mild cardiomegaly.  Thoracic aorta is tortuous.  Superior mediastinum is somewhat widened, overall unchanged compared to the prior study.  There is bibasilar opacities, some of which appear somewhat increased compared to the prior study; however, this can be due to low lung volumes.  There is prominent vasculature in upper lung areas, as well as interstitial markings. 
IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly, status-post CABG.  Bibasilar opacities with interstitial markings and vascular prominence, worrisome for mild CHF.  Lower lobe opacities can represent atelectasis, however, pneumonia cannot be excluded."

IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**4-15**] through 30: 
Current opacification of the base of the left lung could be return of atelectasis or dependent edema.  There is probably more severe edema in the right lung. Worsened consolidation in the right lower lobe today than on [**4-15**] when there was severe atelectasis could be either more atelectasis or pneumonia.  Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion has increased over the past several days.  Heart size is normal and mediastinal veins are not as distended as they have been indicating improved volume status. 
Left PIC line ends in the mid SVC and a nasogastric tube can be traced to the upper stomach and out of view."

"PORTABLE SEMIERECT CHEST OF [**2174-8-1**] 
COMPARISON:  Previous radiograph of earlier the same date. 
INDICATION:  Status post bronchoscopy. 
There has been interval development of a large left pneumothorax.  The left lung is partially atelectatic and response to the large pneumothorax.  There is a more confluent area of opacity lateral to the left hilum, which may represent an area of pulmonary contusion given the patient's recent trauma. Within the right lung, there has been interval improvement of previously present opacities in the right lower lobe with minimal hazy opacities remaining.  However, patchy peripheral right upper lobe opacities have slightly worsened.  Left-sided clavicular and rib fractures are noted.

TECHNIQUE:  24 spot fluoroscopic images were obtained during the course of an ERCP without the presence of a radiologist.  Images are presented for further review. 
IMPRESSION:  A biliary stent is seen prior to the introduction of the endoscope. This was consequently removed.  Cannulation of the biliary duct was achieved, and contrast medium was injected, resulting in opacification of the ducts.  Moderate dilation of the proximal CBD is seen.  Per the ERCP report, this is due to a stricture at the lower third of the CBD.  For further details, please refer to the full ERCP report on OMR."
"PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST OF [**2164-2-10**] 
COMPARISON:  [**2164-2-9**]. 
INDICATION:  [**Doctor Last Name 6818**] drain removal. 
Left chest tube has been removed.  A moderate left pneumothorax with apical and basilar components is present, with interval enlargement of the basilar component manifested by increasing lucency adjacent to the left lower heart border and left hemidiaphragm.  Air space opacity in the left upper lobe has slightly progressed, and diffuse homogeneous opacity in the left mid and lower lung region are not substantially changed.  The latter is likely due to a combination of densely opacified lung and adjacent pleural fluid.  The right lung is grossly clear.  A tracheostomy tube and left PICC line are unchanged in position. 
IMPRESSION: 
Enlargement of basilar component of moderate left pneumothorax following tube removal."

COMPARISON:  [**5-23**] through [**2139-5-27**]. 
FINDINGS:  A new right-sided PICC line has been inserted.  The line takes a sharp cranial turn in the upper SVC, extending 4 cm, likely within the left brachiocephalic vein.  Endotracheal and enteric catheters tubes are in unchanged position.  Moderate cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema are unchanged. 
IMPRESSION:  Right-sided PICC line tip likely in the left brachiocephalic vein.  Line should be withdrawn by 4.5 cm and a repeat chest radiograph should be obtained."
"CLINICAL INDICATION:  Placement of OG tube. 
FINDINGS: A single AP portable view of the chest demonstrates no interval change in the position of the ET tube and an interval increase in hazy opacity which occupies the right mid and lower lung.  The right hemidiaphragm appears obscured.  The extent to which the patient positioning contributes to this appearance is unknown. 
The enteric  tube courses below the diaphragm and conforms to the contour of the gastric fundus.  There are no findings to suggest complications in this respect. 
IMPRESSION: 
1)  Increased right lung base opacity and reduced visualization of the right hemidiaphragm since [**2169-6-28**].  This may reflect evolving airspace disease, increase in pleural fluid, patient positioning, or most likely a combination of these three."
"INDICATION:  Line placement. 
COMPARISON:  [**2150-5-8**]. 
FINDINGS: 
Right CVL remains in place.  ETT tip is located 3.4 cm above the carina.  A feeding tube is seen with its tip coiled in the left upper quadrant similar to that noted previously.

INDICATION:  Aortic dissection and hemothorax. 
COMPARISON:  [**2114-10-20**] at 17:38. 
FINDINGS:  Lines and tubes remain in place.  The widened mediastinum and left apical cap are again noted but the apical cap appears to have expanded in size.  The amount of air containing lung on the left has decreased perhaps due to an element of compressive atelectasis.  The right lung is clear of consolidation and its pulmonary vascular markings appear slightly coarser, suggests an element of increased congestion. 
IMPRESSION: 
Increased accumulation of pleural fluid (likely hemothorax) since prior. Stable mediastinal widening consistent with aneurysm. 
Compressive atelectasis at the left lung and some progressive congestive changes."

"ARTERIAL STUDY. 
HISTORY:  52-year-old with fem-fem graft. 
FINDINGS:  The patient apparently has bilateral iliac stents, that on the right has failed, that on the left remains patent (based on [**2106-8-9**] runoff). Currently, waveforms are monophasic bilaterally and diffusely.  The ABI on the right is 0.64 and on the left is 0.76.  The volume recordings are in [**Location (un) 3382**] with the Doppler tracings.  Exercise testing was also performed with a marked decline in ABI measurements bilaterally with failure to rebound to baseline even up to three minutes after resting. 
IMPRESSION:  Significant bilateral iliac disease.  Low volume recordings at the calf levels also indicate bilateral SFA disease.  Given these findings, assessment of patency of the cross femoral graft cannot definitively be made."
"INDICATION:  Pneumonia, recent bronchoscopy. 
FINDINGS:  Comparison to serial radiographs dating back to [**2167-7-23**] and most recently [**2167-8-6**].  The positions of the endotracheal tube tip, right internal jugular and left subclavian catheters and two nasogastric tubes are satisfactory.  No pneumothorax is shown. There is worsened obliteration of the left medial hemidiaphragm and retrocardiac density  and right lower lobe density since [**2167-8-6**].  Upper lobe venous diversion and a moderately large right pleural effusion are unchanged since [**2167-8-6**].

COMPARISON:  [**2118-4-15**]. 
PELVIS, AP; LEFT HIP, AP AND A FROGLEG LATERAL:  Left total hip arthroplasty is present, with acetabular screws, distal cerclage wire, and surrounding heterotopic ossification.  Femoral component appears rotated, although this may be positional.  There is a new obliquely oriented fracture through the left greater trochanter, with approximately 1.5 cm superolateral displacement from the femoral shaft.  Fracture margins appear slightly irregular, suggesting subacute time course with partial resorption. 
Moderate degenerative changes are present in the lower lumbar spine, bilateral sacroiliac joints, and right hip.  Left acetabular subchondral cyst again noted.  The visualized bowel gas pattern is normal.

COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs with the latest on [**2172-4-6**]. 
LEFT LATERAL DECUBITUS CROSS-TABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The study is markedly limited by patient's body habitus.  The right lung is only partially imaged, with marked decreased lung volume secondary to the mass effect from the massively enlarged liver.  The visualized portion of the right lung appears grossly unremarkable without pneumothorax or definite focal airspace consolidations.  The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4.2 cm above the carina.  The left lung is not assessed. 
IMPRESSION:  Markedly limited study secondary to patient's body habitus.  The visualized right lung is grossly unremarkable."
"HISTORY:  MVA. TRAUMA SERIES. 
AP FILM OF CHEST ON TRAUMA BOARD.  Right and probably left pneumothoraces layering on supine position with hyperlucency in the lung bases.  There was one and probably two right chest tubes, the position of which raised a question whether they lie within major fissure.  There is an associated small amount of subcutaneous emphysema on the right.  The superior mediastinum is slightly widened and there is a unusual contour of the NG tube (suggestive of mediastinal hemorrhage).  The tip of ET tube lies at the level of T3.  No fracture identified although the lateral left hemithorax not optimally visualized. 
AP FILM OF THE PELVIS, ON TRAUMA BOARD.  Suboptimal exam with the upper portion of the sacrum and iliac bones not imaged and SI joint inadequately assessed.  No fracture identified.

"Portable chest on [**2160-1-20**] at 6:49. 
INDICATION: Left chest wall pain. 
FINDINGS: There are no old films. Fractures of ribs 7 and 8 are demonstrated. An oblique view would help to delineate more fractures if present. There is a left pleural effusion and some relative increase in the pulmonary vasculature on the left as compared with the right. There is no pneumothorax. The left hemidiaphragm is not well seen and atelectasis or pneumonia are likely to be present. No rib fractures are seen on the right and the right lateral costophrenic sulcus is sharply delineated. 
IMPRESSION: 
At least two left rib fractures laterally associated with an effusion and increased pulmonary vasculature. Left lower lobe atelectasis versus pneumonia present as well. 
No PTX."
"HISTORY:  Worsening infiltrate. 
Chest, single AP view. 
There are diffuse somewhat patchy interstitial infiltrates, with pleural fluid or thickening at the right base and minimal pleural blunting at the left base. On the current examination, there is suggestion of a rounded lucency in the right mid zone.  This appears to be associated with surgical sutures within the lung  -- ? cavitation vs confluence of shadows. Attention to this area on followup films is requested. Alternatively, this could be evaluated by a CT scan. Otherwise, the extensive pulmonary findings are unchanged. 
IMPRESSION:  Diffusely increased interstitial markings in both lungs with right greater than left pleural fluid or thickening.  Suspect developing area of cavitation in the right lung adjacent to the site of sutures. See comment."
"INDICATION: S/P mitral valve replacement. 
CHEST AP: Comparison is made with the prior film dated [**2190-12-19**]. Again noted is evidence of multichamber cardiomegaly, but no evidence of upper zone redistribution. No evidence of pulmonary edema. The hilar and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to patient's positioning. There is possible atelectasis/infiltrate at the left lower lobe and the right lower lobe. Also noted is blunting of the left CP angle, suggestive of small pleural effusion on the left side. Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable. Surgical wires are noted overlying the sternum, suggestive of prior intervention.

COMPARISON:  None. 
CLINICAL HISTORY:  60-year-old woman with infection, question osteomyelitis. 
FINDINGS:  AP, lateral, oblique views of the right foot were obtained.  Bones are diffusely demineralized, which somewhat limits evaluation for subtle osteomyelitis.  Additionally, there is diffuse soft tissue swelling without soft tissue gas or foreign body.  A bandage overlying the heel likely indicates the site of soft tissue ulceration.  There is no definite sign of osteomyelitis in the underlying bone.  There are plantar and retrocalcaneal spurs present.  No definite fracture or dislocation is seen.  A mild hallux valgus deformity and mild hammertoe deformities is incidentally noted.  There is vascular calcification. 
IMPRESSION:  Diffuse soft tissue swelling without definite signs of soft tissue gas or foreign body.  Probable ulceration along the soft tissues at the heel without underlying signs of osteomyelitis."

"HISTORY:  Stroke and vomiting. 
TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest. 
COMPARISON:  None. 
FINDINGS: 
Low lung volumes are present.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is likely mildly enlarged.  Aorta is tortuous.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures, and mild pulmonary vascular congestion is likely present, but no overt pulmonary edema is seen.  There may be a trace left pleural effusion.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases, more so on the right, likely reflect atelectasis though aspiration cannot be completely excluded.  No pneumothorax is identified.  There is no acute osseous abnormality.

IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**2-1**]: 
New endoesophageal device ends at the gastroesophageal junction alongside a nasogastric drainage tube, which ends in the upper stomach but would need to be advanced 4 cm to move all the side ports below the junction.  Right apical pleural tube unchanged in position.  No appreciable right pleural effusion or pneumothorax, though either could be missed on a supine view.  Multiple retained bullet fragments in the upper abdomen including two largest fragments projecting over the liver and midline at the L1 level, respectively. 
Heart size top normal, exaggerated by low lung volumes, which also makes it difficult to assess pulmonary vascular engorgement and possible mild edema. ET tube in standard placement. 
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 5910**] was paged."
"INDICATIONS:  Myasthenia, status post intubation, elevated white count. 
PORTABLE AP CHEST:   Comparison is made to previous films from [**2137-9-7**]. 
FINDINGS:   There is a left subclavian central venous line with the tip in the superior vena cava. The heart is normal in size. The aorta is partially calcified. The pulmonary vessels are within normal limits.  There is a small right sided pleural effusion. The left CP angle is not included in the present study. There is  better aeration of the lower lobes.  There is a patchy atelectasis in the right lung base. There is no pneumothorax.

HISTORY:  43-year-old IV drug abuser with endocarditis and mitral regurgitation.  Respiratory failure. 
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to 9:50 p.m. on [**9-10**]: 
ET tube is in standard placement.  New nasogastric tube ends in non-distended stomach.  Mild cardiomegaly has worsened as has moderately severe pulmonary edema.  The more pronounced bibasilar consolidation confirmed by abdomen CT on [**9-10**] is less striking today, but the sequence of events is still concerning for a component of pneumonia, particularly due to aspiration. 
No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion."
"INDICATION:  History of multiple myeloma status post bone marrow transplant with tachycardia, tachypnea and dyspnea.  Please rule out lower extremity clot. 
COMPARISONS:  None.

Discussed with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 11037**] via phone at [**Pager number **]."
"CLINICAL HISTORY:  Grossly bloody stools and concern for necrotizing enterocolitis. 
Portable supine view of the abdomen from 5:30 pm [**2198-5-10**] is compared to the study obtained earlier in the day. 
There continues to be multiple air-filled mildly dilated and relatively featureless loops of bowel, however, there has been some interval redistribution of bowel gas. There is still some abnormality in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen where a single loop of bowel has remained persistently present. 
There are no areas of pneumatosis seen.  No portal venous gas is present.  No intraperitoneal free air is seen. 
IMPRESSION:  Findings that are still consistent with the history of necrotizing enterocolitis, but no complications or evidence of perforation is seen."
"INDICATION:  86-year-old woman with ruptured AAA. 
COMMENTS:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest is reviewed and compared with the previous study of yesterday. 
The patient has underlying severe pulmonary emphysema.  There is continued mild congestive heart failure with mild cardiomegaly and small bilateral pleural effusion.  Patchy atelectasis is seen in both lower lobes.

"INDICATION: 61-year-old man status post right lobectomy six weeks ago. Now with shortness of breath. 
COMPARISON STUDY: [**2175-7-28**]. 
FINDINGS: Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable in appearance. Again seen is a right-sided hydropneumothorax with slightly increased fluid in the interval and not unexpected. The patient is status post right pneumonectomy. The left lung is clear. No left-sided pleural effusion or CHF is identified. The fifth right rib has been resected. 
IMPRESSION: No significant change from prior exam. Specifically no evidence for abnormality in the remaining left lung."
"INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with history of gastric cancer with nausea and bloating. 
COMPARISON:  None available. 
FINDINGS:  Slightly prominent loops of bowel are noted in the left upper quadrant with  multiple air-fluid levels.  There is a relative paucity of gas throughout the descending colon.  As a result, these findings may be representative of a small-bowel obstruction or ileus.  There is no evidence of free air.  Osseous structures are normal.  No soft tissue calcifications or radiopaque foreign bodies are detected. 
IMPRESSION:  There is slight prominence of loops of bowel in the left upper quadrant with multiple air-fluid levels noted elsewhere.  As a result, these findings may be representative of obstruction versus ileus.  Clinical correlation is recommended."

"INDICATIONS:  65-year-old woman with right lower lobe consolidation status post bronchoscopy and biopsy. 
CHEST, SEMI-UPRIGHT AP PORTABLE:  Comparison is made to recent radiographs since [**2148-7-18**].  Earlier imaging is not available.  A left-sided PICC line has been pulled back somewhat and now terminates in the distal right brachiocephalic vein.  The lung volumes are low.  Allowing for differences in technique and lung volumes, there is probably little significant change in the appearance of bilateral effusions.  A more focal left mid lung density, noted previously, is partly obscured but probably improved.  There is no pneumothorax. 
IMPRESSION:  Malpositioning of PICC line.  This was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14737**] the same day.  Similar bilateral effusions, allowing for differences in technique."

The patient is status post left pneumonectomy.  There is stable complete opacification of the left hemithorax.  Within the right lung, there is right upper lobe volume loss, along with pleural and parenchymal scarring, which appears stable. 
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus is unchanged since [**2166-11-1**] and likely due to scarring. 
Skeletal structures reveal stable post-thoracotomy changes. 
IMPRESSION:  Stable radiographic appearance of the chest status post left pneumonectomy.  Chronic pleural and parenchymal scarring in the right upper lobe with associated volume loss also appears stable.  Dedicated two-view chest exam could be obtained for more complete assessment, if clinically warranted."

On the previous examination, no NG tube was identified. 
There is no pneumothorax.  The lung fields remain clear, without evidence of new infiltrates.  As before, increased translucency in particular in the upper lung fields are indicative of emphysema. 
IMPRESSION: 
Stable status, successful NG tube placement.  No new parenchymal infiltrates."
"FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH 
INDICATION:  Aortic aneurysm status post EVAR.  Increasing oxygen requirement. Assess for pulmonary edema. 
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph [**2122-3-25**]. 
FINDINGS: 
The heart is markedly enlarged.  There is a ill-defined retrocardiac opacity on the right measuring approximately 3.5 cm in diameter.  This has been previously described and is unchanged in appearance.  There is loss of clarity of the left costophrenic angle suggesting small pleural effusion.  There is also an ill defined increase in density in the left retrocardiac region which may represent a superimposed infiltrate. 
There is no evidence of pneumothorax. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Unchanged right retrocardiac density. 2.  New left pleural effusion and possible new infiltrate in the left lower lobe."
"REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough. 
PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to [**2169-12-25**]. 
The patient is after median sternotomy and CABG.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  The lungs are hyperinflated but essentially clear.  There is interval resolution of left pleural effusion with normal aeration of the lung bases.  The surgical clips in the right upper axillary clips are noted.  The median sternotomy and surgical clips in the mediastinum are related to descending aorta aneurysm repair.  The previously demonstrated biapical opacities have resolved as well. 
IMPRESSION: 
Hyperinflated but clear lungs, most likely due to small airway disease given the absence of emphysema.  Resolution of previously demonstrated pleural effusion and apical consolidations.  Status post descending and aortic aneurysm repair.  If clinically warranted, further evaluation with HRCT might be considered for precise characterization of the airways and the degree of air trapping."
"INDICATION:  75-year-old male with rising WBC, ? of retrocardiac opacity. 
FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiographs are compared with the PA and lateral study dated [**2147-12-5**].  The heart size is normal.  No retrocardiac opacities are appreciated on the current study.

COMPARISON:  [**2114-2-25**]. 
FINDINGS:  Nasogastric tube reaches the stomach with side port below the gastroesophageal junction.  Ventriculoperitoneal shunt is intact throughout its visualized course.   Small amount of air is presentin the distal colon. No small bowel dilatation is appreciated. The evaluation for free intraperitoneal air is extremely limited on a single supine view.  Hazy opacity is seen in the pelvis and may reflect present of free fluid.   Limited evaluation of lung bases demonstrates bilateral patchy airspace opacities and bilateral pleural effusions. 
IMPRESSION:  Further improvement of colonic distension."
"INDICATION:  Parietal lesion consistent with metastasis, for presurgical mapping. 
COMPARISON:  MR head done on [**2142-3-26**]. 
TECHNIQUE:  Post-contrast MR sequences, axial T1, axial MP-RAGE with sagittal and coronal reformations - Wand Study protocol. 
FINDINGS: 
The previously noted right parietal lesion at the vertex, with central nonenhancing area and irregular peripheral enhancement is redemonstrated for surgical planning.  This measures 1.8 x 2.3 x 2.4 cm.  No obvious new lesions are noted.  The MP-RAGE sequence is somewhat limited due to motion-related artifacts. 
IMPRESSION: 
Redemonstration of the right parietal lesion measuring 1.8 x 2.3 x 2.4 cm. for surgical planning.  Other details as above."
"INDICATION:  Status post left fem-[**Doctor Last Name 102**] bypass, high oxygen requirement, assess for effusions / CHF. 
COMPARISON:  [**2192-8-9**]. 
CHEST SINGLE VIEW:  Interval removal of an endotracheal tube.  Again, seen is a right IJ catheter with its tip projecting over the upper SVC, unchanged in position.  Cardiac size is top normal given technique.  Intact median sternotomy wires are seen.  Decreased retrocardiac opacification.  Increased consolidation of the entire left lung with air bronchograms.  Probable right small pleural effusion.  Vascular congestion in the right lung more prominent at the base.  There is no pneumothorax.   Again, seen are bilateral breast implants with peripheral calcification. 
IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary edema, probable small right pleural effusion and improved left basal atelectasis."
"CHEST PA AND LATERAL 
HISTORY:  Cough, status post cystectomy. 
PA and lateral views of the chest are submitted and compared to the patient's prior PA and lateral views from [**2134-5-4**] as well as postoperative films from [**2134-12-29**].  Small bilateral pleural effusions are present which are new.  The cardiac silhouette, however, and central pulmonary vasculature appear unchanged compared to the patient's preoperative studies and no edema or focal parenchymal consolidation to suggest pneumonia is seen.  The flowing osteophytes of DISH are evident in the thoracic spine anteriorly. 
CONCLUSION: 1.  New small bilateral pleural effusions without evidence of current CHF or edema. 2.  No pneumonia. 3.  DISH."
"INDICATION:  Congestive heart failure status post central line placement. 
CHEST X-RAY, PORTABLE AP:  Comparison made to prior study of [**2151-12-3**].  There is a left chest wall pacemaker with three leads, two with tips in the right ventricle and one with tip in the right atrium.  A new right-sided PICC is seen with tip in the upper superior vena cava.  There is no pneumothorax. The lung volumes are low, limiting evaluation.  There is opacity in the left retrocardiac region and at the right lung base consistent with atelectasis. There is no definite congestive heart failure. 
IMPRESSION:  New right PICC with tip in the upper superior vena cava.  No pneumothorax."
"Compared to [**2121-7-25**]. 
CLINICAL INDICATION: Central line placement. 
A left subclavian central venous catheter is in satisfactory position within the superior vena cava. There has been interval further opacification of the right hemithorax which now completely opacified. Rightward rotation of the patient limits accurate assessment for mediastinal shift, but there is no definite shift towards the opposite, left hand side. Blurring of the pulmonary vasculature and the left hemithorax is thought to be due to respiratory motion. 
IMPRESSION: Complete opacification of right hemithorax, likely due to a combination of a large pleural effusion and collapse of the right lung. Repeat nonrotated film may be helpful for more complete assessment. Vascular catheter in satisfactory position."
"[**Last Name (un) 243**]-INTESTINAL TUBE 
INDICATION:  82-year-old female with sepsis and intubation.  Patient needs intestinal access for nutrition and medications.  Multiple previous attempts with NG tube and Dobbhoff failed attempts. 
TECHNIQUE:  Nasointestinal feeding tube placement. 
FINDINGS:  Under direct fluoroscopic guidance, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 245**]-[**Doctor First Name 246**] feeding tube was passed into the stomach, beyond the pylorus and into the duodenum.

"GADOLINIUM-ENHANCED LUMBOSACRAL SPINE IMAGING 
HISTORY:  Assess current status of known epidural abscess. 
TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted gadolinium-enhanced lumbar spine imaging was obtained. 
COMPARISON STUDY:  MR scan of the lumbar spine from [**2136-7-21**]. 
FINDINGS:  The large epidural abscess previously noted, with both ventral and dorsal components, appears essentially unchanged in extent.  Once again, there is also some increase in the pre-contrast T1 hyperintensity of the cerebrospinal fluid as well as probable mild enhancement of the cauda equina rootlets, best appreciated on the sagittal post-contrast images.  Purulent arachnoiditis is the likely diagnostic consideration.  The previously noted posterior paraspinal soft tissue abscesses are also relatively unchanged in size. 
CONCLUSION:  Stable, grossly abnormal study as noted above."
"STUDY:  AP chest. 
CLINICAL INDICATION:  47-year-old man status post lumbar spine fixation, now with fever. 
TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest.  Findings are compared with prior examination dated [**2148-8-13**].

The regional soft tissues are unremarkable.  Talar dome contour is smooth.  The mortise is congruent.  The lateral process of the talus is unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION: 
Unremarkable right foot and ankle.  The previously described equivocal distal fibular and lateral calcaneal fractures are not seen.  It is possible that these represent artifact on the previous exam.  Correlation with physical examination is requested."
"PORTABLE CHEST ON [**2173-6-20**] AT 16:37 
INDICATION:  Left chest tube on water-seal. 
COMPARISON:  [**2173-6-20**]. 
FINDINGS: 
The left chest tube remains in place.  There is no evidence of PTX.  The previously seen thickening along the right pleural surface is less prominent confirming the rotational contribution from the prior study.  Hazy density over the left base suggests that there is fluid layering out and there is persistent retrocardiac density, unchanged from prior.  The left CVL remains in place.  Again noted is the right clavicular fracture. 
IMPRESSION:  No PTX with chest tube on water-seal.  Left pleural fluid layering out a bit more than prior."

"INDICATIONS:  ETT removal. 
PORTABLE AP CHEST AT 9:43:  Comparison is made to previous films from  [**2138-1-30**] at 10:25. 
FINDINGS:   The ETT has been removed. The nasogastric tube remains with the tip in the region of the stomach. The right sided central venous catheter remains in place.  Continued evidence for right lower zone consolidation/collapse exists. It is perhaps less extensive than seen on [**2138-1-29**] but patient is more rotated.  The left hemidiaphragm is less well defined as compared to [**2138-1-30**] but again positional differences could contribute. The upper lung zones remain free of abnormality. 
Pulmonary vascular markings are within normal limits. 
IMPRESSION:  Accounting for rotational differences, probably no significant interval change -  persistent right lower lobe collapse/infiltrate and some poor definition to the left hemidiaphragm. 
ETT removal."

"Portable chest [**2159-2-27**]. 
CLINICAL INDICATION:  Status post tracheostomy. 
There are no prior films for comparison, but comparison is made to a scout image from a CT of the neck from [**2159-2-24**]. 
A tracheostomy tube appears in satisfactory position.  The examination is limited due to low lung volumes and excessive image noise.  There is prominence of the superior mediastinum, which is most likely due to accentuation by technique.  The heart size is within normal limits.  The lungs demonstrate minimal patchy opacities at the right base and are otherwise clear.  No definite pneumothorax is identified. 
IMPRESSION: 
Limited study demonstrating satisfactory positioning of tracheostomy tube. Given the limitations of the current study, a repeat radiograph with improved inspiratory effort and improved technique is recommended for more complete assessment, as well as to better evaluate the superior mediastinum."
"CHEST PORTABLE AP 
COMPARISON:  None. 
HISTORY:  Anorexia nervosa with NSVT, evaluate for abnormal cardiac morphology or signs of infection. 
FINDINGS: 
There are low lung volumes.  The cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Apparent increased hazy opacity in the right mid to lower lung zone likely represents a combination of atelectasis and overlying soft tissues. This could be further evaluated with dedicated PA and lateral.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The osseous structures are grossly unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process. Right lung hazy opacity likely represents combination of superimposition of soft tissues and atelectasis."
"INDICATION:  Post-pyloric tube advancement. 
PROCEDURE:  The patient was brought into the fluoroscopy suite with a Dobbhoff tube already inserted into the first part of the duodenum.  Current position was verified by fluoroscopy.  The right naris was anesthetized with lidocaine jelly.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, the Dobhoff tube was advanced into the fourth part of the duodenum.  Placement was confirmed with the injection of 10 cc of Conray contrast.  There were no complications.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

The heart size is enlarged, stable since [**2138**].  The mediastinal contour is unchanged including the bulging in the aortopulmonic window which most likely represents a combination of pulmonary vasculature and mediastinal fat. Evaluation of the lungs demonstrates perihilar haziness and vascular engorgement compatible with fluid overload/mild heart failure.  The lateral view demonstrates coronary stent.  There is no appreciable pleural effusion. 
The right PICC line tip is in mid portion of right subclavian vein. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Mild volume overload/failure, not significantly changed since [**2144-11-23**].  No evidence of focal consolidation to suggest bacterial pneumonia. 2.  Mediastinal prominence stable since [**2138**]. 3.  Evidence of coronary artery disease."

"HISTORY: Status post right subclavian line placement. 
COMPARISON: [**2111-9-22**]. 
Tip of the endotracheal tube remains in good position approximately 4.6 cm above the carina. There is a right IJ line the tip of which is in the proximal right atrium. Previously this had been a Swan-Ganz catheter. Question if it has been exchanged or if has simply been pulled back. Tip of the NG tube is not well visualized but projects in the region of the stomach. There is no evidence of a right subclavian line. Question if this was attempted or actually placed. There is no pneumothorax. There is persistent focal opacity behind the left side of the heart consistent with atelectasis or infiltrate which is stable. 
IMPRESSION: Right IJ line with the tip in the right atrium. No evidence of a right subclavian line. No pneumothorax."
"HISTORY:  Unresponsive, evaluate line placement. 
Compared with the previous film, a left subclavian line has been placed, tip over mid/distal SVC.  No supine film evidence of pneumothorax is detected.

"Portable chest [**2112-3-28**]. 
COMPARISON:  [**2112-3-11**]. 
INDICATION:  Status post aortic valve replacement. 
The patient is status post median sternotomy and aortic valve replacement. Various lines and tubes are present, in satisfactory position.  Lung volumes are low.  This factor, combined with postoperative status of the patient, likely accounts for slight widening of the cardiac and mediastinal contours. The expiratory nature of the radiograph accentuates the pulmonary vascularity and may account for associated perihilar haziness as well, but it is difficult to exclude a component of mild fluid overload.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion. 
IMPRESSION:  Postoperative appearance of the chest as described."
"INDICATION:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female status post fall with intracranial hemorrhage.  Evaluate for pelvic fracture.

The left central venous catheter terminates in the distal left brachiocephalic vein.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The right lung remains clear. 
IMPRESSION:  No lobar collapse.  Persistent but stable patchy opacity in the left retrocardiac region of the left lower lobe likely represents atelectasis. An early infectious process cannot be excluded."
"TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view. 
INDICATION:  History of bypass surgery and ICD placement, MRSA bacteremia, status post central venous line placement, check position. 
FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in supine position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of [**2127-2-28**].  A new internal jugular approach central venous line has been placed apparently via a sheath.  A catheter of approximately 6-French size has been advanced through the sheath and is seen to terminate overlying the SVC at the level of the carina.  Other previously described devices including right subclavian approach central venous line and ICD with permanent pacer in left axillary position are all unchanged.  No pneumothorax has developed.

Right upper lobe neoplastic mass and adjacent lymphadenopathy."
"HISTORY:  Infection of right second toe. 
Three radiographs of the right foot again demonstrate the patient to be status post resection of the distal first ray and second PIP joint arthroplasty.  The findings are similar to that noted on [**2133-3-20**].  Atherosclerotic calcifications are again seen.  No acute fracture is evident.  Enthesophyte at the calcaneal insertion of the Achilles tendon is unchanged.  No air is identified in the regional soft tissues.  No localizing history is provided. Remodeling of the base of the proximal phalanx of the third toe, less conspicuous on the previous study, likely represents the sequela of remote trauma. 
IMPRESSION: 
No acute injury identified. 
No interval radiographic change to suggest osteomyelitis.  If osteomyelitis remains a clinical concern, then a three-phase bone scan could be obtained."
"CHEST PORTABLE LINE PLACEMENT ON [**4-27**] 
HISTORY:  Renal disease and abdominal pain.  Admitted to SICU with need for central venous access. 
Portable semi upper chest radiograph shows that the patient's right IJ central venous catheter tip has been repositioned and is now at the level of the mid superior vena cava.  Again no pneumothorax is evident.  There is slight diffuse increased hazy density over the left hemithorax compared to the most recent films without significant rotation to account for the asymmetry.  This could be related to unilateral edema or two symmetric density of the chest wall. 
CONCLUSION:  Right IJ central venous catheter tip at level of distal SVC with no pneumothorax.  Recommend clinical correlation with regards to diffuse increased density over left hemithorax."
"CLINICAL HISTORY:  Neck pain.

AP PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST [**2169-7-9**] AT 12:00 NOON:  Comparison is made to prior portable chest film dated [**2169-7-7**].  The right internal jugular venous line has been removed.  Much of the bilateral pulmonary opacities have resolved.  There is still patchy opacity in a perihilar distribution, right greater than left, most likely represents residual CHF.  There is new left PICC line in place with its tip at the junction of the superior vena cava in the right atrium. No pneumothorax. 
IMPRESSION:  Right PICC line tip at the cavoatrial junction.  Improvement in CHF."
"INDICATIONS: Carcinoid tumor, status post resection. 
PA AND LATERAL CHEST:  Comparison is made to previous films from  one day earlier. 
There has been interval removal of two right sided chest tubes.  There is a very tiny right apical pneumothorax present.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable in the postoperative period. There is volume loss in the right hemithorax with shift of the mediastinum and elevation of the right hemidiaphragm which is also stable.  There are minor atelectatic changes in the right lung base.  No significant pleural effusion is evident. Subcutaneous emphysema is noted in the right chest wall and is slightly improved in the interval.

FINDINGS: A right internal jugular central venous line catheter sheath is seen with its tip at the distal portion of the right internal jugular vein. There is no pneumothorax. An ETT is in good position. An NG tube is seen coiled within the fundus of the stomach with its tip heading cephalad. The heart is enlarged but the cardiomediastinal borders are unchanged. There are bilateral pleural effusions with diffuse bilateral patchy alveolar opacities with ill definition of the pulmonary vasculature. 
IMPRESSION: 1) Right internal jugular vein catheter sheath seen at distal end of right internal jugular vein. 2) Findings consistent with pulmonary edema and cardiac failure, slightly worse from prior exam."
"INDICATION:  60-year-old woman with CLL/SLL and status post right pleural tap 1.4 liters removed with pleuritic chest pain on right.  Rule out pneumothorax or other pathology. 
COMPARISON:  [**2195-12-25**]. 
PA AND LATERAL VIEW, CHEST:  There is an interval reaccumulation of the right- sided pleural effusion which appears worse than the pre-tap study done on [**2195-12-25**].  Unchanged moderate left pleural effusion.  There is bibasilar atelectasis adjacent to the effusions.  Remainder of the lung fields are clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  Hilar contours are normal.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is obscured by bilateral moderate pleural effusion.

SUPINE CHEST:  Comparison is made to the study performed one day prior. 
FINDINGS:  Dual-chamber pacemaker and ICD leads and right IJ central venous catheter remain in stable, satisfactory position.  There is stable mild cardiomegaly with a left ventricular configuration.  Pulmonary edema has improved since the prior study.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions as well as atelectasis at the left lower lobe. 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Improving pulmonary edema. 2.  Persistent left lower lobe atelectasis."
"INDICATION:  Patient with wheezing, please evaluate for pneumonia or CHF. 
COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple chest radiographs with dates ranging from [**2137-4-25**] to [**2137-7-19**] as well as a chest CTA performed on [**2137-4-22**]. 
FINDINGS:  Chest, PA and lateral radiograph demonstrate relatively stable bilateral heterogeneous patchy opacities in the upper lung zones.  However, there is a more focal opacification now evident in the right middle lobe silhouetting the right heart border.  This may represent plate-like atelectasis; however, an infectious process cannot be excluded.  Stable deformities of the right posterolateral ribs are again identified, consistent with prior fractures.  Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  No pleural effusions evident.  No pneumothorax is present. 
IMPRESSION:  Relatively stable bilateral upper lung patchy opacities are consistent with history of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.  However, there is a new focal opacification in right middle lobe, atelectasis versus infectious process."

There is  a difficult evaluation of the hepatic artery on the left side with normal spectral flow. No fluid collections are noticed. The bile ducts inside the left lobe are not dilated. 
IMPRESSION: Unremarkable examination of the left lobe of the liver with normal flow in the portal vein, hepatic vein and hepatic artery. The intra and extrahepatic bile ducts are not dilated."
"HISTORY:  Fever and tachypnea.  R/O infiltrate. 
AP PORTABLE SUPINE VIEW OF CHEST:  Extreme apices not included on film.  There is increased retrocardiac densities, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/o consolidation.  There is a probable small left pleural effusion. Triangular opacity overlying the right hilum is compatible with segmental collapse.  Upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring is compatible with CHF. 
ET tube, NG tube and right subclavian central line noted.  Tip of right-sided central line overlies distal SVC/RA junction, unchanged. 
IMPRESSION: 1)  New segmental collapse in right lung. 
2)  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and suspected small left efffusion. 3)  Probable CHF."
"CLINICAL HISTORY:  47-year-old trauma patient with suspected bladder injury status post exploration.  Evaluate bladder. 
TECHNIQUE:  Approximately 200 cc of water soluble contrast were administered via the patient's indwelling Foley catheter.  Additional contrast could not be given due to patient discomfort.  Images were obtained during filling as well as during and after emptying. 
FINDINGS:  There is a somewhat bilobed configuration to the bladder dome, a finding which could represent distortion from known surrounding hematoma. No extraluminal contrast material is identified.  Post void view of the bladder demonstrates complete emptying without evidence of residual contrast in the pelvis. 
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of bladder leak."
"HISTORY:  79-year-old woman with carotid bruits. 
RADIOLOGIST:  The study was read by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1240**] [**Name (STitle) 1241**]. 
TECHNIQUE:  Evaluation of the extracranial carotid arteries was performed with B-mode, color and spectral Doppler ultrasound. 
FINDINGS:  Mild amount of plaque was seen bilaterally at the origin of the internal carotid arteries. 
On the right side peak systolic velocities were 58 cm/sec for the internal carotid artery, 69 cm/sec for the common carotid artery and 102 cm/sec for the external carotid artery.  The right ICA/CCA ratio was 0.84. 
On the left side peak systolic velocities were 72 cm/sec for the ICA, 88 cm/sec for the CCA and 70 cm/sec for the ECA.  The left ICA/CCA ratio was 0.82. 
Both vertebral arteries presented antegrade flow. 
COMPARISON:  None available. 
IMPRESSION:  Less than 40% stenosis of the bilateral internal carotid arteries."
"INDICATION:  57-year-old man with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, with difficulty threading  CVL's of IJ's.  Evaluate for upper extremity clot. 
FINDINGS:  Symmetric venous waveforms are seen in both subclavian veins.  Both internal jugular veins compress completely and demonstrate normal venous waveforms with respiratory variation.  Both axillary veins, and brachial veins, display normal venous waveforms, augment well, and compress completely. Both basilic and cephalic veins compressed completely, and demonstrate normal flow within them. 
At the site of the left AV fistula, there is no evidence of a collection. 
CONCLUSION: 1)  No ultrasound evidence of deep venous thrombosis of the upper extremities."
"INDICATIONS:  Patient with metastatic disease. Now with leg swelling, right greater than left. 
DOPPLER ULTRASOUND OF LIMBS:

RIGHT SIDE: The right common femoral, saphenous, superficial femoral and popliteal veins are patent with normal compressibility, augmentation and respiratory variation. No right sided DVT is identified. The proximal right tibial veins are also seen and are patent.  There is evidence of subcutaneous edema on the right side. 
LEFT SIDE: The left common femoral vein, and left popliteal vein appear patent. Again subcutaneous edema is identified. 
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT."
"HISTORY: COPD, preop. 
PA & LATERAL CHEST: There are no prior studies for comparison. There is prominence of the right aortic contour, which is concerning for an aneurysmal dilatation of the ascending aorta. There is flattening of the hemidiaphragms and lung hyperinflation. There is patchy atelectasis at both bases, which could represent scarring. No cardiomegaly or vascular congestion. No pleural effusions. No focal consolidations. 
IMPRESSION: 1) No definite pneumonia or cardiac failure. 2) Prominence of the right aortic contour, concerning for an ascending aortic aneurysm. A CTA of the chest is recommended for further evaluation, as well as correlation with any prior studies. These findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9158**] by phone."
"INDICATION:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with cough, low-grade temperature, abdominal distention. 
PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Comparison was made with the prior chest radiograph dated [**2199-5-27**].  The heart is top normal in size allowing the technique.  Again note is made of markedly elongated and tortuous aorta.  Lung volumes are low, probably due to low inspiratory level.  There is faint opacity at the lung bases, probably representing atelectasis.  No evidence of CHF or other consolidation is noted.  Degenerative changes of thoracolumbar spine is noted.  No evidence of free air below the diaphragm. The lateral view is limited due to overlying soft tissue. 
IMPRESSION:  Somewhat limited study.  Probable bibasilar atelectasis. Tortuous aorta."
"INDICATIONS:  Assess line placement. 
PORTABLE AP CHEST:  Comparison is made to previous films from 8 hours prior. 
FINDINGS:   The heart and mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  There has been interval repositioning of a left sided PICC catheter, however, its tip is still within the left internal jugular vein. There has been improved aeration of the bilateral lungs with a decrease in basilar atelectasis. In addition, there has been improvement in the right mid and lower lung zone parenchymal opacifications.  There has been interval removal of an NG tube. 
IMPRESSION:  Continued malpositioning of a left PICC line with its tip terminating in the left IJ Vein. Interval improvement and bibasilar atelectasis and right mid/lower lung zone parenchymal opacifications."
"INDICATION:  56 year old male with right upper extremity swelling and pain, assess for DVT. 
FINDINGS:  [**Doctor Last Name **] scale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 654**] were performed of the right upper extremity veins.  There is evidence of normal color flow, waveform and compressibility within the right IJ, axillary, brachial, and cephalic veins. There is normal color flow and waveform within the right subclavian vein.  The basilic vein could not be visualized secondary to patient's inability to cooperate with the examination.  No intraluminal thrombus is identified. 
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of right upper extremity DVT.  The right basilic vein could not be visualized secondary to the patient's inability to cooperate with the examination."

IMPRESSION: 
1)  Moderate right pleural effusion and a new small left pleural effusion with bibasilar atelectasis. 
2)  Cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary vascular engorgement but no pulmonary edema."
"PORTABLE CHEST 
One portable view at 2:40 p.m.  The right costophrenic angle is not included. Comparison is made with the previous study done earlier the same day.  There is interval improvement in mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  Increased density in the retrocardiac area consistent with atelectasis or consolidation persists.  The patient is status post median sternotomy and the heart and mediastinal structures are unchanged in appearance.  An endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and Swan-Ganz catheter remain in place. 
IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement in pulmonary vascular congestion.  No other significant change."
"AP PORTABLE CHEST, [**2111-3-17**] AT 07:46 HOURS 
HISTORY:  Question of aspiration pneumonia. 
COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated [**2111-2-14**]. 
FINDINGS:  The previously noted right upper extremity approach PICC line has been removed in the interval.  Please note the patient remains markedly rotated for this radiograph similar to the prior.  The lungs are clear with no consolidation or edema evident.  There is a tortuous atherosclerotic aorta. The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits for size.  No effusion or pneumothorax is evident.  There is a levoconcave curvature of the thoracic spine with extensive degenerative disease, particularly to the mid and lower thoracic spine noted.  No displaced fractures are seen. 
IMPRESSION:  Relatively stable chest x-ray examination with no apparent aspiration or other consolidation noted."
"INDICATION:  Check line placement. 
PORTABLE CHEST:  A single erect view obtained at 4:04 PM is compared to [**2192-7-6**].  A right PICC has been placed with the tip in the upper SVC.  The heart size is at the upper limit of normal for technique.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is discoid atelectasis in the right mid lung zone and an area of increased density in the left lower lobe, which may be due to atelectasis or pneumonia.  A percutaneous gastrostomy is noted. 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Tip of right PICC in upper SVC. 
2. Discoid atelectasis in the right mid lung zone. 
3. Atelectasis vs. pneumonia in left lower lobe."
"CHEST, [**2147-7-4**]: 
INDICATION:  History of hypotension and CHF.  Subclavian line placed.  Check position and rule out pneumothorax. 
FINDINGS:  A single AP upright image.  Comparison study taken four hours earlier.  A new left subclavian central line is noted with its tip well positioned in the lower SVC.  The cardiac silhouette again shows marked enlargement, probably biventricular but with LV predominance.  There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle consistent with pleural effusion.  A small subpulmonary effusion may also be present on the left side.  The pulmonary vessels show minimal if any upper zone redistribution.  No complicating pneumothorax is seen.

The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. 
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute intracranial process identified. 
NOTE AT ATTENDING REVIEW: A portion of the right maxillary sinus anterior wall is not included on this scan, due to a technical positioning error.  There is partial imaging of what may be two small retention cysts in the left maxillary sinus, along its floor."
"HISTORY:  61-year-old male with questionable posterior circulation stroke, intubated prior to MRI evaluation. 
No prior comparison exams are available. 
SINGLE SUPINE PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH 
Please note overall evaluation is markedly limited due to low lung volumes. The endotracheal tube tip is approximately 3 cm from the carina, and nasogastric tube is noted to pass below the diaphragm with distal tip not identified.  Mediastinal and hilar contours appear widened which is likely related to underlying low lung volumes.  No evidence of pneumothorax or frank pulmonary edema. 
IMPRESSION: Limited evaluation of the chest due to markedly low lung volumes. Tip of endotracheal tube approximately 3 cm proximal to the carina with nasogastric tube tip within the distal stomach or proximal small bowel."

COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs available from [**2127-11-26**] and [**11-6**], [**2126**]. 
UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: There has been interval removal of the endotracheal tube, Swan-Ganz catheter, mediastinal drains, nasogastric tube, and left thoracostomy tube.  There is no pneumothorax.  There has been interval increase in the small left-sided pleural effusion and a new small right effusion.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis is slighly worsened on the left, and the left hemidiaphragm is slightly elevated. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Interval removal of multiple lines and tubes, with no evidence of pneumothorax. 2. Small increase in left pleural effusion, and new right effusion. 3. Slightly elevated left hemidiaphragm. 4. Bibasilar atalectasis, slightly worse on the left."
"INDICATION:  Evaluate left central venous catheter placement. 
COMPARISON:  [**2141-7-26**]. 
PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Again seen is a right-sided central venous catheter.  There has been interval placement of a left-sided central venous catheter with the tip positioned in the proximal SVC.  The right costophrenic angle is not included on this study.  Again, seen is cardiomegaly.  There has been interval increase in the left-sided pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Soft tissue and osseous structures are unchanged. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Interval placement of a left-sided central venous catheter with the tip in the proximal SVC.  No pneumothorax is seen.  No change in the right-sided central venous catheter. 2.  Interval increase in the left pleural effusion.  Underlying left lower lobe atelactasis or consolidation can not be excluded."
"FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH 
INDICATION:  Status post cardiac arrest.  Intubated.  Endotracheal tube placement. 
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph [**2156-1-29**]. 
FINDINGS: There is an endotracheal tube in situ.  The tip of the endotracheal tube is approximately 4 cm from the carina.  There is a right internal jugular central venous catheter.  The tip of this is projected over the SVC.  There is evidence of a left pleural effusion.  The medial portion of the left hemidiaphragm is not visualized likely indicating collapse consolidation at the medial aspect of the left lower lobe.  There is no pneumothorax. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Left pleural effusion. 2.  Probable persistent atelectasis/consolidation in the left lower lobe."
"INDICATION:  Fever, elevated white cell count, resolving pulmonary edema. 
SINGLE VIEW CHEST:  Comparison with CT scan and chest radiograph of [**2133-8-2**].  There are diffusely increased pulmonary interstitial markings indicating pulmonary edema, which appears slightly worse compared to the examination of one day ago.  The opacity representing fluid seen in the minor fissure is again identified, though less well defined.  Additionally, there is a small pleural effusion along the right costophrenic angle and a smaller one along the left.  Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are less well appreciated due to the indistinctness of pulmonary vascular markings.  Midline sternotomy wires are unchanged.  Bowel gas pattern is normal. 
IMPRESSION:  Worsening pulmonary edema and bilateral small pleural effusions."
"AP CHEST, 1:14 P.M. ON [**11-3**]: 
HISTORY:  Variceal bleeding.  Right IJ line and ET tube placement need to be evaluated. 
IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: 
Tip of the endotracheal tube is substantially above the clavicles, nearly 11 cm from the carina, 7 cm is too high.  Subsequent chest radiograph at 2:11 shows repositioning of the ET tube in standard placement.  Widening of the superior mediastinum extending into the neck, separating right internal jugular line from the trachea, could be due to a hematoma or preexisting cervicothoracic mass such as a goiter.  This possibility was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 25560**] by telephone at the time of dictation.  Heart is mildly enlarged. Lungs are clear.  No pneumothorax."
"HISTORY:  Worsening 02 saturation. Evaluate for CHF. 
CHEST, AP PORTABLE:  Comparison is made to prior portable study of [**2163-7-11**]. The heart is mildly enlarged. Again noted is placement of a swan ganz catheter, with tip in the right main pulmonary artery.  There is significant improvement of pulmonary vasculature.  There is residual bilateral lower lobe infiltrate/atelectasis.  Again noted is a right sided pleural effusion with possible left sided pleural effusion.

SUPINE ABDOMEN:  Prominence of the cecum is again noted.  However, the amount of dilatation appears decreased compared to prior examination.  Air is seen throughout the remainder of the colon.  No small bowel dilatation is identified.  There is no intraperitoneal free air.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are stable. 
IMPRESSION:  Slightly less dilated cecum and no evidence of small bowel dilatation.  This appearance is less concerning for obstruction and sigmoid volvulus."
"INDICATION:  69-year-old male with history of left ureteral stent.  Assess number of stents. 
COMPARISON:  [**2151-9-29**]. 
TWO VIEWS OF THE ABDOMEN demonstrate a left-sided nephrostomy tube and a left J-J ureteral stent.  No other stents are identified. A long tubular structure is noted projecting over the left iliac [**Doctor First Name 1654**], but is likely external to the patient. Bowel gas pattern is unremarkable.  There are multiple surgical clips in the lower pelvis as before. Degenerative changes of the lumbar spine are noted. Remaining soft tissues and osseous structures are otherwise unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION: Visualization of nephrostomy tube and J-J ureteral stent on the left."
"STUDY:  Single supine abdominal radiograph. 
INDICATION:  82-year-old male with prostate metastasis to the epidural space. Check NG tube position. 
FINDINGS:  Nasogastric tube is not visualized on this radiograph although the beam is centered in the upper pelvis, thus not including the upper abdomen. There is a nonobstructing bowel gas pattern.  Ossific density within the upper lumbar and lower thoracic spine is most likely consistent with degenerative changes seen on recent CT from [**2104-5-27**].  The previously noted destructive lytic lesion within the L5 and S1 region noted as obliteration of the S1 superior endplate. There are bilateral hip replacements. 
IMPRESSION:  Nasogastric tube not visualized on this study, although the upper abdomen was not included in the field of view."
"CLINICAL INDICATION: Decreased oxygen saturations and tachycardia. 
Comparison is made to previous study of [**2116-1-30**]. 
An endotracheal tube, central venous catheter and nasogastric tube remain in place. Endotracheal tube terminates about 7 cm above the carina. The heart is enlarged but stable. Vascular engorgement and diffuse perihilar haziness is again demonstrated as well as bilateral pleural effusions. The perihilar opacities appear slightly asymmetric, worse on the left than the right. Overall, the perihilar opacities have slightly increased in the interval. 
IMPRESSION: Persistent layering pleural effusions. 
Increasing perihilar haziness, more confluent on the left side than the right. This may relate asymmetrical pulmonary edema. Underlying pneumonia in the left lung cannot be excluded."
"INDICATION:  Nausea, vomiting, low oxygen saturation level. 
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph [**2196-4-24**], and [**2195-12-24**]. 
PORTABLE UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Cardiac silhouette is top normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Minimal patchy opacities are noted at the lung bases, which could reflect atelectasis but infection is not completely excluded.  There is no pleural effusion, focal consolidation, or pneumothorax. Calcifications projecting over the left lung apex are presumed to be vascular in etiology.  Degenerative spurring of the acromioclavicular joint is redemonstrated.  No acute osseous findings are seen. 
IMPRESSION:  Minimal patchy opacities at the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis though infection cannot be completely excluded.                                                                       DFDdp"
"HISTORY:  Post liver resection for cholangiocarcinoma with continued bilious type drainage from [**Location (un) 384**]-[**Location (un) 1976**] drain.  ERCP showed leak, treated with a biliary stent, now presenting for stent pull/cholangiogram. 
ERCP SPOTS AND IMAGES:  Four spot films from an ERCP performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5027**] are provided for review.  Scout film shows an indwelling plastic biliary stent.  Subsequent images demonstrate filling of the common ducts and right- sided hepatic ducts.  There is a focal stricture in the proximal common hepatic duct.  There is no leak appreciated. 
IMPRESSION:  Focal stricture in common hepatic duct may represent recurrence of disease.  Clinical correlation advised."
"HISTORY:  Cerebellar hemorrhage. 
COMPARISON:  [**2165-3-3**] CT. 
TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and T2 images through the brain with postgadolinium enhanced imaging. 
FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of an enhancing mass within the brain parenchyma.  In agreement with the recent CT, there is evidence of intraventricular hemorrhage, as well as within the left pons.  The ventricles grossly appear stable in size, with a ventricular catheter within the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 218**] of the right lateral ventricle.  No evidence of new shift of normally midline structures is apparent.  There is no evidence of acute ischemia on diffusion-weighted imaging. 
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of an underlying enhancing mass or acute ischemia, to explain the known left pontine and intraventricular hemorrhage."
"HISTORY:  60 year old woman with increasing hypoxia. Please check for fluid overload. 
REPEAT PORTABLE CHEST [**2190-5-2**] at 11 a.m.:  The exam is technically limited. Compared to prior study on [**2190-4-22**], there is better aeration of the right lung. However, patchy opacities are seen throughout the right lung with consolidation at the right base and in the perihilar region and retrocardiac region of the left lung. This is not a typical pattern for fluid overload. 
IMPRESSION:  Better aeration of the right lung with residual densities in the right lung obscuring the right hemidiaphragm. This may be fluid infiltrat and/or atelectasis. Patchy density is seen in the perihilar and retrocardiac region of the left lung."
"REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the NG tube placement. 
Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed without benefit of comparison to the prior films. 
FINDINGS:  The NG tube tip is in the stomach in standard position.  The heart size is normal.  Mediastinum has normal position, width and shape. 
There is entire right lung consolidation and left upper lobe consolidation, which might represent pneumonia.  Some other possibilities such as hemorrhage or asymmetric edema should also be considered, but in the absence of the enlarged heart and pleural effusion, the pulmonary edema is less likely.  For precise evaluation, additional clinical history and previous exams are necessary. 
IMPRESSION: Bilateral lung consolidatons as described most probably representing pneumonia."

"AP CHEST, 6:31 A.M., [**2172-7-28**] HISTORY:  Vomiting while ventilated. Question aspiration. 
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**7-27**]: 
Mild interstitial edema has worsened.  There are no focal findings to suggest pneumonia or bronchial obstruction.  Heart size is normal.  Fullness in the mediastinum could be due to paratracheal adenopathy, but there is no mass effect, and findings could alternatively be due to a combination of fat deposition and vascular engorgement. 
ET tube is in standard placement, and nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.  I cannot tell whether a loop of tubing over the left supraclavicular region is vascular line.  Clinical assessment would be required, but if this is a vascular catheter, it does not ends centrally."

INDICATION:  44-year-old woman with hypoxia. 
FINDINGS:  The right lower lung zone atelectasis and pleural effusion are improved today; however, the right lower lobe is still not fully re-expanded. In addition, the appearance of the left lower lobe consolidation and pleural effusion is also improved.  There is a new focal bulge below the level of the aortic knob, which may represent atelectatic lung compressed against the hilum.  There is no pneumothorax.  Support devices remain in good position. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Improved appearance of right and left lower lobe consolidation and pleural effusions. 2.  Slight change in mediastinal contour of unclear significance. Conventional PA and lateral chest radiograph to be obtained when the patient is stable to better evaluate this finding."
"PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH FROM [**2120-7-23**] AT 11:15. 
INDICATION:  Post CABG. 
Comparison is made to [**2120-7-19**]. 
FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube, left-sided chest tube, and pulmonary artery catheter have been removed.  A right-sided IJ central venous catheter is seen with tip in the upper SVC.  Given the supine positioning, the pulmonary vessels are within normal limits.  There is an ill-defined left perihilar opacity, which may represent consolidation within the superior segment of the left lower lobe and could be due to aspiration.  There continues to be some increased density at the apex of the left lung which could represent chronic pleural thickening or a small tracking left-sided pleural effusion. 
IMPRESSION: 
1) No pneumothorax. 
2) No CHF. 
3) Consolidation within the left perihilar space which could be consistent with aspiration."
"INDICATION:  Repositioning of Swan-Ganz catheter.  Evaluate new placement. 
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from [**2180-5-25**] at 2:11 p.m.

Improved aeration of the left lung.  Persistent airspace and interstitial opacities within the right upper lobe."
"CHEST 2 VIEWS PA & LATERAL: 
HISTORY: Arrhythmia. 
No previous films for comparison. Heart size is within normal limits with mild prominence of the LV contour but no evidence for CHF. There is slight unfolding of the thoracic aorta. Possible small calcific focus is present at the right lung base. An apparent collection of tiny nodular densities in the right mid zone seen only in the PA film is likely due to end on vessels. The remainder of the lungs are clear and there are no pleural effusions. There is calcification in the anterior longitudinal ligament of the thoracic spine. 
IMPRESSION: No evidence for CHF. Tiny nodular densities on right likely due to vascular structures but this may be confirmed by a short term follow up exam. No evidence for pneumonia or pleural effusion."
"EXAMINATION:  Ultrasound of left upper extremity.

IMPRESSION:  1)  No pneumothorax. 2)  Left mid-lung opacity which could represent atelectasis, early pneumonia or aspiration."
"INDICATION:  84-year-old man with chest pain and recent MI. 
Comparison is made to the prior radiograph of [**2147-3-7**]. 
FINDINGS:  The patient is significantly rotated to the right side which severely limits evaluation of the radiograph however the heart size appears normal.  The aorta is mildly tortuous.  Opacification is noted in the right lung basem new from prior exam.  A smaller density is noted in the left lung base. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. The soft tissue and osseous structures are unchanged. 
IMPRESSION: Study is moderately limited due to patient rotation to the right side. However, right lung base pneumonia is highly suspect.  There may be an additional focus in the left lung base raising concern for multifocal pneumonia."

UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  The mediastinal contours are stable, with calcification of the aorta redemonstrated. Right basilar calcified nodules and calcified mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are redemonstrated, compatible with prior granulomatous disease. There is perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness, compatible with mild pulmonary edema, which has worsened in the interval.  A small pleural effusion on the right demonstrates a component which is loculated laterally.  The size of this effusion is similar compared to the prior study.  Patchy opacities at lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax. 
IMPRESSION:  Mild congestive heart failure, slightly worse in the interval, with small right pleural effusion which is partially loculated laterally.                                                                       DFDdp"

Moderate cardiomegaly is exaggerated by lower lung volumes, but there is new pulmonary vascular engorgement to suggest early cardiac decompensation. 
Gaseous dilatation of the intestinal tract in the upper abdomen is also new. No pneumoperitoneum or pneumothorax. 
A severe compression fracture of an upper lumbar vertebral body is more pronounced today than on [**2200-4-6**], whether this represents a real change is difficult to say, given differences in level of inspiration.  It could be a source of pain causing atelectasis and hypoxia."
"INDICATION:  Right subclavian line placement. 
COMPARISON:  [**2160-8-5**]. 
FINDINGS:  The cardiac silhouette, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The lungs are clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  The right costophrenic angle is mildly blunted likely due to pleural thickening.  No pleural effusions. There is persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. 
There is a new right-sided central venous catheter with its tip projecting at the level of the proximal SVC.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  The osseous structures are unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of right-sided subclavian approach central venous catheter with its tip at the level of the proximal SVC.  No evidence of pneumothorax."
"INDICATION: Intracranial hemorrhage. S/P ETT and NG tube placement. 
PORTABLE AP CHEST: There is an ETT with the tip well positioned in the mid trachea. An ETT tip is positioned overlying the stomach. There is a right sided dual chamber pacemaker and the leads overlie the right atrium and right ventricle respectively. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. There is a patchy opacification overlying the right lower lobe. The left lung is clear. There are no pleural effusions and no pneumothoraces. The pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits. 
IMPRESSION: 1) Satisfactory position of the ETT and NG tube. 
2) Patchy opacification right lower lobe, which may be due to aspiration, contusion, atelectasis or pneumonia."
"RIGHT ELBOW, THREE VIEWS 
INDICATION:  Status post right elbow fracture.  Evaluate. 
FINDINGS:  Comparison to [**2165-12-4**].  Postoperative changes status post ORIF of the proximal ulna with a dorsal plate and multiple screws is seen. Underlying fracture deformity of the ulnar shaft is still evident with no definite evidence of interval healing.  There is increased heterotopic bone formation, even compared to the recently performed radiograph.  No additional fracture deformity is seen.  A lucent tract within the more distal ulnar shaft reflects previous hardware. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Status post ORIF of the right ulna without evidence of hardware-related complication or change in alignment. 2.  Increased heterotopic bone formation, even when compared to the recently performed prior study."
"INDICATION:  Red ulcer on great toe and erythema on the medial aspect of the foot.  Evaluate for osteomyelitis. 
COMPARISON:  Right foot radiographs, [**2141-5-18**]. 
THREE VIEWS OF THE RIGHT FOOT:  Extensive vascular calcifications are present. No definite fracture, dislocation, focal lytic or sclerotic osseous abnormality is seen.  No cortical destruction is seen along the medial aspect of the first digit to suggest osteomyelitis.  No soft tissue gas is present. 
Degenerative changes are again seen involving the first MTP, first IP joints, as well as within the mid foot.  Small plantar calcaneal spur is identified. Alignment is unchanged. 
IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence to suggest osteomyelitis.  Please note that MRI is a more sensitive modality for the evaluation of osteomyelitis.                                                                       DFDdp"
"PORTABLE CHEST, [**2135-6-21**]: 
CLINICAL INDICATION:  Decreased breath sounds in right lung.  Confirm appropriate ETT placement. 
An ETT is in satisfactory position.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits for portable supine technique and low lung volumes. There is minimal patchy opacity in the retrocardiac portions of the lower lobes. The lungs otherwise appear clear, and no pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  A right scapular fracture is noted. 
IMPRESSION: 1)  ETT in satisfactory position. 2)  Minimal patchy retrocardiac lung opacities bilaterally, with otherwise clear lungs.  This most likely represents patchy atelectasis but aspiration is an additional consideration."
"INDICATION:  S/P MVA with multiple rib fractures and pulmonary contusion, check chest tube position and pneumothorax. 
No comparison chest radiograph is available. 
CHEST, AP UPRIGHT:  A chest tube is in place, terminating at the left lung base.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax. 
The heart, mediastinal contours, and pulmonary vascularity are probably within normal limits allowing for the AP technique.  Patchy opacities are present at the left lung base, which may represent atelectasis or hemorrhage and was demonstrated on the prior CT study of [**2182-7-15**].  There are no pleural effusions. 
The osseous structures reveal multiple minimally displaced fractures of left posterior ribs. 
IMPRESSION:  Chest tube at the left lung base.  No evidence of pneumothorax."
"INDICATION: 32 y/o female with respiratory failure s/p suicidal attempt. 
AP SUPINE SINGLE VIEW CHEST is compared to AP semi-erect view of the chest from [**2167-2-22**]. 
FINDINGS: There is again noted left subclavian central line with the tip in the upper SVC. Again noted 2 mediastinal wires. There is an NG tube and another tube both with the tip in the duodenum. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are obscured due to the diffuse pulmonary opacities. There is interval slight decrease in the lung volumes, however, the diffuse opacities are unchanged. 
IMPRESSION: 1) Unchanged appearance of diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacities likely due to chemical pneumonitis complicated by ARDS. Findings suggestive with areas of fibrosis. 2) NG tube and other gastric tube are located in duodenum."
"HISTORY:  Status post NG tube placement.  Check position. 
Comparison is made to the prior study of [**2129-10-10**]. 
FINDINGS:  This is a technically suboptimal image.  The nasogastric tube is seen descending in the esophagus to approximately the left of the right atrium at which point it is no longer identifiable and therefore its final location is uncertain.  A repeat film is recommended. 
In this suboptimal film there is evidence of an enlarged cardiac silhouette and left lower lobe infiltrate vs atelectasis.  The area of increased opacification in the right upper lobe seen on the prior film is again present and as far as can be determined is unchanged. 
IMPRESSION:  Terminance of the nasogastric tube is indeterminable in this suboptimal radiograph.  There appear to be no significant changes otherwise."
"INDICATION:  Multifocal pneumonia 
FINDINGS:  A single frontal view of the chest with comparison of [**2134-1-26**]. The extreme apices are not included on this study.  The tracheostomy tip is 1.5 cm above the carina.  The right subclavian central line catheter is unchanged.  When compared with the prior study there has been interval increased interstitial opacities bilaterally.  Again seen are multifocal areas of more consolidative parenchyma most pronounced within the right mid to upper lung zones as well as left lung base.  There is a loculated right pleural effusion.  There are multiple calcified granulomas.  No pneumothorax is seen. 
IMPRESSION:  Stable areas of consolidation with interval increase in interstitial opacities bilaterally.  Superimposed ARDS should be considered."
"HISTORY: Pneumonia.  Coronary artery disease with intubation. 
Endotracheal tube is 5 cm above the carina.  NG tube extends below the diaphragm.  Left sided dual chamber pacer present with atrial ventricular leads in situ poorly localized on this underpenetrated film.  CV line introduced via right jugular vein is in right brachiocephalic vein.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size is within normal limits and there is no evidence for CHF.  There is opacity at the left base with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm consistent with consolidation in the left lower lobe.  There could be an associated small left pleural effusion. 
IMPRESSION:  Persistent left lower lobe consolidation and possible small left pleural effusion.  No evidence for CHF.  No pneumothorax."
"INDICATION:  79-year-old female status post trauma.  Evaluate for pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. 
COMPARISON:  None available. 
TECHNIQUE:  AP radiograph of the chest was obtained. 
FINDINGS:  There is a large right pneumothorax with right upper lobe and likely right middle lobe collapse.  The right hemidiaphragm is depressed.  No mediastinal shift is appreciated.  Heart size is top normal.  The left lung is well aerated.  A left seventh rib fracture is seen. 
IMPRESSION:  Large right pneumothorax with depression of the right hemidiaphragm. 
These findings were reported to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1693**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13430**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3787**] by telephone at 9:35 a.m. on [**2165-3-27**]."
"AP CHEST, 5:44 P.M., [**1-21**] 
HISTORY:  Check NG tube placement.  Ileus. 
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**5-15**] through [**1-17**]: 
New nasogastric tube would need to be advanced 8 cm to move all the side ports into the stomach, where the tip of the tube is now. 
Severe bilateral upper lobe scarring on the right.  Consolidation on the left, which developed between [**Month (only) 6512**] and [**1-8**] is pneumonia, improved since [**1-9**], stable since [**1-17**].  Right PICC line ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction.  Heart size is normal.  No pneumothorax. Severe gaseous intestinal distention seen in the imaged portion of the upper abdomen.  No definite pneumoperitoneum."
"INDICATIONS:  74-year-old woman with shortness of breath, aortic stenosis, and congestive heart failure, for PICC line placement assessment. 
CHEST, AP PORTABLE:  Comparison is made to [**2132-3-26**]. The tip of the new PICC line is not well visualized, but appears to terminate in the distal superior vena cava or near the cavoatrial junction.  An overlying EKG lead partly obscures area, limiting exact precise evaluation. The heart is similarly enlarged with a left-sided pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. 
IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory positioning of right-sided PICC line.  Left effusion and cardiomegaly."
"CLINICAL HISTORY:  Possible 4th ""vessel"" within the umbilical cord, raising consideration for urachal remnant. 
The urinary bladder was moderately distended and normal in appearance.  No abnormal fluid collection or structure was identified extending from the bladder to the umbilicus.  Please note that the examination is limited by the umbilical arterial and venous catheters which limit scanning in this region. Both kidneys are normal in size, contour, and echo texture for the patient's age with the right measuring 2.2 and the left 3.3 cm.  There is no hydronephrosis. 
IMPRESSION:  Normal renal and bladder ultrasound.  If concern for urachal abnormality persists I would recommend a follow up dedicated bladder/umbilical ultrasound when the patient is older and clinically well."
"Compared to prior examination dated the same date earlier.  Again seen, portions of a right IJ catheter terminating at the SVC-RA junction, a nasogastric tube reaching the body of the stomach and a PDA clip.  The bladder is distended, as there is a soft tissue density projecting over the lower pelvis.  Air-filled loops of bowel, which appear moderately more distended than on the prior examination.  Bubbly lucencies in the right quadrant of the abdomen likely represents air and fecal material rather than pneumatosis.  No portal venous gas or free air is seen. 
IMPRESSION:  Continued bowel wall distention with some thickened loops of bowel, slightly more distention than on the prior examination.  No convincing evidence for pneumatosis at this time.  Recommend continued serial followup."
"ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND 
INDICATION:  48-year-old man with TIPS/cirrhosis, evaluate for TIPS patency and focal liver lesions. 
ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND:  Comparison is made to prior examination of [**2133-2-4**]. The liver architecture is coarse.  Two cysts are identified in the liver.  The right kidney measures 12.2 cm.  The left kidney measures 13.2 cm.  There is splenomegaly of 16.7 cm. 
The TIPS is patent and wall-to-wall color flow is seen throughout.  The following velocities were obtained:  Main portal vein 32 cm/sec, proximal TIPS 29 cm/sec, mid TIPS 65 cm/sec, and distal TIPS 67 cm/sec.  Reversal of flow is noted in the left portal vein.  There is no evidence for ascites.

"INDICATION:  74-year-old male with sternal infection.  Evaluate for aspiration. 
FINDINGS: 
Video fluoroscopic swallow evaluation was performed in conjunction with speech pathology department.  Varying consistencies of barium were administered under continuous fluoroscopic guidance in the lateral projection. 
On the current study, there is penetration with thin and nectar-thickened liquids, though aspiration is only seen with concurrent swallowing of a barium tablet.  Of note, the tablet did not pass into the esophagus, rather becoming stuck in the vallecula.  It was thus intentionally regurgitated. 
IMPRESSION: 
Penetration with thin and nectar-thickened liquids. 
Aspiration with concurrent swallowing of of thin liquids and a barium tablet.

Persistent recent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm secondary to atelectasis in the right lower lobe could be due to an endobronchial mucous plug, otherwise unchanged."
"INTRAOPERATIVE ULTRASOUND OF THE LIVER 
INDICATION:  Multiple liver metastases, for planned right hepatic lobectomy. 
Intraoperative scans of the liver demonstrated a 9-mm hyperechoic nodule at the extreme lateral inferior margin of segment III.  No other focal lesions were identified in the left lobe or caudate lobe.  In the right lobe, there are numerous isoechoic nodules seen, most of which had central calcifications. At least four or five nodules were identified, the largest being in segment VIII measuring up to 4 cm in diameter with second 2-cm nodule immediately adjacent.  Several other nodules are seen elsewhere in the right lobe.

COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from [**2116-8-26**] at 12:50 p.m. 
ONE VIEW OF THE CHEST: 
The lungs are well expanded and have relatively lower opacity compared to the prior examination.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions.  An ET tube terminates 1 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is noted in the stomach appropriately. 
IMPRESSION: 
ET tube terminates 1 cm above the carina and should be withdrawn for optimal positioning. 
These findings were communicated via telephone to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2763**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2764**], M.D. at 4:40 p.m. on [**2116-8-26**]."
"INDICATION:  82 y/o woman status post CABG, now with desaturation. 
AP semiupright single view of the chest is compared to [**2130-5-9**]. 
FINDINGS:  Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  There is a left subclavian central line with the tip in low SVC.  There is interval marked improvement in the bilateral patchy interstitial opacities when compared to the previous study. These findings suggest improvement of pulmonary edema. However, the interstitial markings and alveolar opacities are still increased when compared to baseline interstitial opacities seen in the preoperative chest radiograph.  There is unchanged appearance in the mild to moderate left pleural effusion, which was not present in the preoperative chest radiograph. 
IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement but not yet complete resolution of the pulmonary edema."

COMPARISON:  [**2185-10-7**]. 
INDICATION:  CHF.  Renal failure.  Cough. 
There has been prior median sternotomy and aortic valve replacement.  Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged but has decreased in size since the previous study with associated resolution of previously reported pulmonary edema. Bilateral retrocardiac opacities are present, persist on the right and worsened on the left.  This is likely due to a combination of atelectasis and adjacent effusion.  Right PICC line remains in place, terminating in the proximal superior vena cava. 
IMPRESSION:  Resolution of CHF.  Moderate right and small left pleural effusions with adjacent basilar atelectasis."
"REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of a patient after thoracocentesis with known renal cell carcinoma and pleural effusion. 
PA and lateral upright chest radiograph compared to [**2189-2-26**]. 
Compared to the prior study, there is significant decrease in the left pleural effusion.  Minimal  apical pneumothorax cannot be excluded.  The right pleural effusion is small and unchanged. 
Multiple pulmonary nodules are demonstrated involving the entire lung consistent with known metastatic disease.  The heart size is mildly enlarged but stable.  The mediastinal contours are unchanged. 
IMPRESSION:  Questionable minimal apical pneumothorax after thoracocentesis with significant decrease in left pleural effusion.

HISTORY:  Rib fractures and hemothorax after rib plating, assess expansion of the lungs. 
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to preoperative study on [**1-30**]: 
Right lung is diffusely edematous and which may relate to recent reexpansion. There is a small right pleural effusion, but no appreciable pneumothorax, two pleural tubes at the apex and one at the base.  Multiple right-sided rib fractures have been plated. 
ET tube in standard position.  Left hemidiaphragm is substantially obscured by a very large hiatus hernia.  I would recommend conventional radiographs when feasible to exclude a diaphragmatic injury, if the clinical history is consistent with sufficient mechanism of injury. 
Heart size normal.  Aorta is intact."
"PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST: 
Compared to previous study of 1 day earlier. 
INDICATION: Fevers. 
An ETT remains in the low position, terminating approximately 1.5 cm above the carina with neck in flexed position. Central line and NG tube are unchanged. There is stable widening of the cardiac and mediastinal contours. There is mild perihilar haziness present, possibly due to crowding of vessels related to low lung volumes. Dense left retrocardiac opacity and a small left pleural effusion persists. 
IMPRESSION: Allowing for low lung volumes, no significant change. Relatively low position of ETT, although flexed position of the neck likely accentuates the low position."

Comparison to prior study from [**2100-10-18**] at 11:45AM. 
CHEST TWO VIEWS:  There has been near complete resolution of left-sided pleural effusion S/P thoracentesis.  No pneumothorax is identified.  There remains increased opacity at the left base with obscuration of left heart border and hemidiaphragm with apparent air bronchogram.  There is slight elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  The remainder of the lung is clear. Mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal. 
IMPRESSION: 
1)  Near complete resolution of left-sided pleural effusion S/P thoracentesis.  No evidence of pneumothorax. 
2)  Residual left lower lobe opacity with apparent air bronchograms may represent residual compressive atelectasis due to the presence of effusion, though pneumonic consolidation cannot be excluded."

COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated [**2101-1-18**]. 
FINDINGS:  Consistent with the given history, a new right internal jugular central line is evident with the distal tip in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction.  There has been relative redistribution of the diffuse mild pulmonary edema previously noted with slight improved aeration on the right and worsening opacity on the left.  This may also be in part that the patient is now more appropriately situated with respect to rotation where the prior study was significantly rotated.  Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right remain evident.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. 
IMPRESSION:  New right internal jugular central line with no evidence of pneumothorax seen."
"EXAMINATION:  AP chest. 
INDICATION:  IJ catheter placement. 
A single image is obtained on [**2116-10-6**] at 12:39 hours and is compared with the prior radiograph performed at 04:33 hours.  The patient had placement of a right-sided IJ sheath.  The tip appears to project over the expected location of the proximal SVC.  Multifocal airspace disease is again seen in the right lung.  Allowing for technical differences, this is not significantly changed since the prior radiograph.  The patient remains intubated with the tip of the ET tube approximately 4.3 cm above the carina.

"INDICATION:  Follow up intraventricular hemorrhage. 
TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT. 
COMPARISON:  Head CT from [**8-26**]. 
NONCONTRAST HEAD CT:  There is no change in the amount of intraventricular hemorrhage.  The previously described ovoid nodule of increased attenuation now is more ill defined in layering posteriorly against the atrium of the right lateral ventricle, and most likely represents a gravity dependent blood clot.  Mild dilatation of the lateral ventricles is unchanged since the prior study.  There is no new vascular territorial infarct or other change since the previous study.  Perinasal sinuses remain partially opacified as described previously. 
IMPRESSION:  No change in amount of ventricular blood or ventricular size. Gravity dependent layering of blood clot in atrium of right lateral ventricle."

On the left, peak systolic velocities are 85, 80, 49 in the ICA, CCA, and ECA respectively.  The ICA to CCA ratio is 1.1.  This is consistent with less than 40% stenosis. 
Antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries. 
IMPRESSION:  Minimal plaque with bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis."
"AP CHEST, 5:31 a.m. [**11-7**]. 
HISTORY:  End-stage liver disease, worsening hypoxia. 
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**11-3**] and 17: 
Moderate left pleural effusion posteriorly distributed in the supine position is probably unchanged in volume since [**11-6**], though increased since [**11-3**]. Consolidation at the medial aspect of the left lung base could be pneumonia or atelectasis, unchanged.  Atelectasis adjacent to the right hilus changes in distribution but not in severity.  Heart size mildly enlarged and pulmonary and mediastinal and vasculature mildly engorged may be due in part to supine positioning, as well as presumed volume overload.  No pneumothorax. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.  Left jugular line tip projects over the mid SVC."
"INDICATION:  Head bleed with facial swelling. 
VIEWS:  Upright AP view compared with supine AP view from [**2125-4-3**]. 
FINDINGS:  The NG tube, ET tube and right IJ central venous line all remain in stable satisfactory positions.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours remain stable.  There is a left retrocardiac opacity present, which may represent atelectasis or consolidation.  A small left pleural effusion is present. Pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits.  Patchy atelectasis is present within the right lower lobe.  No pneumothorax is identified. 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Persistent left retrocardiac opacity, likely representing atelectasis. However, pneumonia or aspiration cannot be excluded. 
2. Small left pleural effusion. 
3. Patchy atelectasis at right base."

"PROCEDURE:  Chest PA and lateral. 
REASON FOR EXAM:  Post-MVR, recent removal of chest drain. 
FINDINGS:  There is a small right apical pneumothorax post-removal of chest drain.  The loculated right-sided pleural effusion unchanged.  Prominence of the vasculature in the upper lobes bilaterally suggest mild pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette is markedly enlarged in comparison to the preoperative chest radiograph most likely due to pericardial effusion. 
The position of the right PICC line, right internal jugular line are unchanged, mitral valve replacement noted. 
IMPRESSION: 
Small right apical pneumothorax post-removal of chest drain. Marked enlargement of cardiac contour in comparison to preoperative chest radiograph suggests a  pericardial effusion.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1172**] [**Name (NI) 14921**]."

"HISTORY:  86-year-old male with cough and fever. 
COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest x-rays from [**2158-11-11**] and [**2158-7-11**]. 
FINDINGS: 
AP and lateral views of the chest.  Lower lung volumes seen on the current exam.  There is persistently increased interstitial markings throughout the lungs bilaterally, not significantly changed from [**11-11**].  There has however been interval development of more confluent opacity in the left lung worrisome for a superimposed infectious process thought to involve the apical segment of the left lower lobe.  There is no definite effusion.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but unchanged.  No acute osseous abnormality detected. 
IMPRESSION: 
Persistently increased interstitial markings in the lungs bilaterally potentially due to interstitial edema or chronic underlying lung disease. Superimposed new consolidation in the left lung worrisome for superimposed infectious process.  Recommend repeat after treatment."
"INDICATION:  57-year-old male status post emergency CABG with IABP. 
COMPARISON:  Prior study from earlier the same date at 1313 hours. 
SUPINE AP CHEST:  The patient is status post median sternotomy.  A right-sided Swan-Ganz catheter is seen with its tip in the pulmonary outflow tract. Midline mediastinal drains and a left basilar chest tube are seen in place. There is no pneumothorax.  A nasogastric tube courses below the level of the diaphragm and out of view.  The heart size is normal.  There is continued moderate pulmonary interstitial edema and small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.

COMPARISON:  [**2132-12-3**]. 
AP UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  The patient is status post CABG with expected post-CABG changes including small right effusion that allowing for more upright positioning is similar in size. There is opacity within the right upper lung with questionable air bronchograms.  This may just represent pulmonary vasculature, however, developing pneumonia cannot be excluded. 
The right Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed with right IJ sheath still in place.  The two left-sided chest tubes are in similar position.  The left hemithorax AICD and leads are intact. 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Stable small right pleural effusion. 2.  Otherwise expected post-CABG changes. 3.  Questionable opacity in right upper lung. Probably normal structures, however pneumonia cannot be excluded."

PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Comparison is made with the prior chest radiograph taken approximately eight hours earlier on the same day. Nasogastric tube was placed, with the tip overlying the left mid quadrant. The patient is status post median sternotomy.  Again note is made of markedly prominent main pulmonary artery trunk and bilateral main pulmonary arteries, with interstitial opacities and lower lobe opacities, overall unchanged compared to the prior study. 
IMPRESSION:  Status post nasogastric tube placement.  Markedly enlarged pulmonary artery most likely due to pulmonary arterial hypertension. Interstitial opacities and bilateral lower lobe opacities of the lung."
"HISTORY:  75-year-old man status post CABG. 
COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph from [**2118-9-3**]. 
FINDINGS:  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Bibasilar opacities, likely postoperative atelectasis are unchanged. The costophrenic angles are blunted bilaterally, unchanged from previous radiograph.  The previously visualized pneumonia pericardium is again seen, decreased in size.  The previously visualized pneumoperitoneum is no longer seen on this study. 
A dual-chamber right-sided cardiac pacer is visualized with leads over the right atrium and right ventricle with two abandoned leads also visualized. Multiple sternotomy wires are unchanged. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Bibasilar atelectasis, mild cardiomegaly and resolving pneumopericardium; none of which are significantly changed from the previous radiograph."
"AP CHEST, 6:29 A.M., [**12-19**]. 
HISTORY:  Thoracic pediculectomy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Tachycardia and pleural effusions. 
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**12-17**]: 
The lung volumes are lower and mild pulmonary edema has developed. Consolidation in the left lower lobe, accounting for mild leftward mediastinal shift is more pronounced and may represent either worsening atelectasis or developing pneumonia, and the same can be said for less severe consolidation in the right infrahilar lung.  Heart is top normal size, unchanged, but there is more congestion of mediastinal veins on today's study.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed.  No pneumothorax.  Tip of right subclavian line projects over the upper right atrium, advanced several centimeters from its previous location.  No endotracheal tube is present today."
"INDICATION:  89-year-old man from [**Location (un) 3766**] with hypoxic on NRB.  History of PE.  Rule out acute process. 
PORTABLE AP CHEST:  Comparison is made to [**2103-5-15**].  Marked cardiomegaly with left retrocardiac opacity likely representing an effusion (atelectasis or pneumonia are possible) is stable.  The patient is status post CABG and aortic valve replacement.  There is a new small right-sided pleural effusion.  Hazy opacities in the left and right mid lung have increased and could represent failure.  A left-sided pacemaker with a single ventricular lead is in unchanged position. 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Cardiomegaly with bilateral pleural effusions (new right-sided effusion) and increased bilateral hazy pulmonary opacities likely represent worsening failure. 
2.  Left retrocardiac opacity could represent effusion and/or atelectasis/pneumonia."
"ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND ON LIVER DOPPLER 
CLINICAL INDICATION:  Alcoholic cirrhosis and hepatorenal syndrome. 
COMPARISON STUDY:  [**2122-9-25**]. 
The liver appears normal in size, echogenicity and architecture, and there are no focal liver lesions seen.  Portal vein flow is normal.  There is no evidence of ascites or splenomegaly. 
The gallbladder is normal in appearance, and there are no definite stones, but there is either a small 3-mm polyp or an adherent stone along the posterior wall.  No bile duct dilatation is noted.  Portal vein flow is patent with normal respiratory variations, and hepatic venous and inferior vena caval flow was confirmed as normal. 
CONCLUSION:  Normal-appearing liver with no worrisome focal lesions."
"INDICATION:  30 year old with chest tube on right for pneumothorax.  Fever, increasing oxygen requirements. 
FINDINGS:  The study is compared to the previous examination of one day earlier and shows continued application of the right chest tube.  There is partial atelectasis involving the right lower lobe.  Segmental atelectasis is noted in the posterior segment of the left lower lobe. These findings have not changed since the previous study.  A small right apical pneumothorax is also suspected.

FINDINGS:  NG tube terminates at the GE junction.  Heart is mildly enlarged but stable in size.  There is bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  The rest of the lungs are clear.  No pneumothorax. Left-sided PICC line has its tip at the SVC-RA junction.  Pleural basilar and perisplenic calcifications that seen previously are again noted. 
IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory position of a left-sided PICC line.  Bibasilar atelectasis.  Tip of NG tube ends at GE junction.  Findings were called to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 52739**]."
"INDICATION:  Decreased breath sounds. 
PORTABLE CHEST:  Comparison is made to prior study of [**2123-1-20**]. 
The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable, allowing for patient rotation. 
There is still a sizeable infiltrate in the left base, which is either unchanged, or perhaps slighlty improved.  There is a focal region of increased markings at the right base laterally, which is also without change.  Blunting of the left lateral costophrenic angle is consistent with a small effusion, again without change.  There is no evidence of a right effusion.  No new pleuro-parenchymal abnormalities are identified. 
IMPRESSION:  No significant change from five days earlier."
"AP CHEST, 8:56 AM ON [**3-28**] 
HISTORY:  62-year-old woman, intubated.  Rule out acute process. 
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to 3:26 a.m.: 
Lung volumes are lower, but mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema has improved, now restricted to the lung bases.  The most severe opacification at the left lung base could be atelectasis or pneumonia, it developed between [**3-24**] and [**3-27**] and has not improved appreciably since.  Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusion and mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly are unchanged. Mediastinal vascular engorgement, which worsened between [**3-27**] and [**3-28**] is stable.  ET tube is in standard placement.  Right jugular line ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction and would need to be withdrawn 1.5 cm to move it confidently into the lower third of the SVC.  ET tube is in standard placement.  No pneumothorax."
"REASON FOR EXAM:  Shortness of breath, COPD. 
COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs with the most recent from [**2131-12-31**]. 
SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Lungs are hyperinflated, compatible with history of COPD.  Scarring and pleural thickening in the right lung apex with some architectural distortion is stable.  There is no evidence of pneumonia or congestive heart failure.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The heart, mediastinum, and hila are normal.  Mild calcifications of the aortic arch are noted, stable.  Fusion hardware within the thoracolumbar spine is stable.  Dense carotid calcification, left greater than right, in the neck incidentally noted. 
IMPRESSION:  COPD with no evidence of acute pneumonia or congestive heart failure."
"CHEST SINGLE AP FILM. 
History of coronary artery disease with stent placement and pneumonia. 
Endotracheal tube is 3 cm above carina.  Right subclavian CV line is in distal SVC.  NG tube is in stomach.  Surgical clips are present in left neck.  There has been no significant change in the ill-defined patchy opacities in the right lower zone and in the opacity in the left lower lobe, findings being consistent with bilateral pneumonia.  No pneumothorax. 
IMPRESSION:  No change since prior film of same date.  Persistent bilateral lower zone opacities as described.  No pneumothorax."
"INDICATION:  Status post left chest tube with right-sided pneumonia. 
COMPARISON:  [**2136-1-11**]. 
UPRIGHT AP CHEST:  Again, there is a small amount of loculated air at the base of the left hemithorax.  It is not significantly changed since the prior study.  The left subclavian central line is unchanged.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  Bibasilar patchy and linear opacities are again demonstrated with a small right pleural effusion.  In the interim, however, there is increased right perihilar opacity raising the possibility of failure superimposed on the pneumonic process. 
IMPRESSION: 1) Probable persistent small left basilar pneumothorax. 2) Unchanged bilateral patchy opacities, likely related to pneumonia. 3) Interval increase in right perihilar opacity, raising the question of superimposed failure."
"INDICATION:  Man status post open reduction and internal fixation of left fourth and fifth metacarpal fractures. 
COMPARISON:  Wrist radiographs from [**2111-4-28**]. 
FOUR VIEWS OF THE LEFT HAND AND WRIST: 
Fine osseous detail is obscured by an overlying cast.  A Kirschner wire is noted in the diaphysis of the fourth metacarpal as well as the head of the fifth metacarpal.  Also noted is significant screws and plating of the fifth metacarpal diaphyseal fractures.  There is mild joint space narrowing of the distal interphalangeal joints as well as the first carpometacarpal joint. 
IMPRESSION: 
Still visible fracture line in the fourth and fifth metacarpals.  Mild degenerative disease of the hand."
"INDICATIONS:  Vaginal bleeding. 
PELVIC ULTRASOUND:  LMP two years earlier.  No prior studies are available for comparison.  The uterus is anteverted and measures 7.4 x 3.6 x 3.8 cm.  There is a large amount of fluid in the pelvis.  The bladder contains a Foley catheter.  The endometrium is normal measuring 5 mm.  There is a small approximately 1-2 cm fundal fibroid.  Both ovaries are normal in size, position, and appearance.  Normal follicular activity is seen in the right ovary. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  No evidence of endometrial hyperplasia, neoplasia, or polyp. 2.  Large amount of fluid in the pelvis, likely secondary to known cirrhosis."
"CLINICAL HISTORY:  Scoliosis, question stability. 
PA and lateral views of the thoracic and lumbar spine were obtained.  The lateral view includes the cervical spine. 
As seen on the study from [**2184-1-15**], there are bilateral, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4743**] [**Location (un) 389**]-type rods extending from roughly the T2-3 level, down to L4. Laminar hooks, multiple wires, and distal pedicle screws are seen.  There is no change in hardware position compared to the prior study.  As seen previously, there is moderate anterior wedging of a vertebral body at the thoracolumbar junction.  There may have been anterior interbody fusions at the lower lumbar levels.  There is only minimal scoliosis convex to the right at the mid thoracic levels and to the left at the thoracolumbar junction.

HISTORY:  Status post VATS and washout of hemothorax. 
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**6-1**] at 11:28 p.m.: 
Right pleural tubes have been modified, new tube at the apex is sharply folded, terminating along the mediastinum, second apical tube ends at the level of the second posterior rib and a basal tube, loops at the right lung base.  Right pleural effusion has been substantially drained.  Moderate atelectasis is present in the right lung.  Mediastinum is minimally shifted to the left.  Left lung is clear aside from basal atelectasis.  No pneumothorax. ET tube, dual-channel right supraclavicular central venous sheath and nasogastric tube are in standard placements."
"INDICATION:  21-year-old man with ARDS, pancreatitis, and elevated liver function tests, please evaluate for cholecystitis. 
No comparison is avaialable. 
Findings: The liver demonstrates normal echogenicity with no focal lesion. The liver has normal hepatopetal flow.  The gallbladder has normal appearance with no stone and no evidence of cholecystitis.  The common bile duct is not dilated and measures 5 mm.  Kidneys are normal in size and appearance with no stone, mass, or hydronephrosis.  The spleen is in the upper limit of normal range measuring 11.9 cm. Small amount of ascites is visualized in the peritoneal cavity.  The pancreas has normal appearance in the head, neck, and body.  The pancreatic tail is not visualized. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  No cholecystitis. 2.  Trace ascites ."
"INDICATIONS:  Left subclavian line change over guide wire. 
AP CHEST:  Comparison is made to the study from [**2106-10-23**].  The endotracheal tube has been retracted.  The tip is now several cm above the carina.  The left subclavian central venous line tip is likely within the proximal SVC near the confluence of the brachiocephalic veins, but is still directed laterally to the right instead of down towards the right atrium.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The NG tube tip and side port remain below the diaphragm.  Cardiac size and pulmonary vasculature are stable in appearance. There is a left pleural effusion which is also not significantly changed. 
IMPRESSION: Left subclavian line tip in proximal SVC. No pneumothorax. Small left pleural effusion."
"PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, [**2203-2-19**] AT 13:59 
CLINICAL INDICATION:  History of respiratory failure with endotracheal tube placement, check location. 
Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated [**2203-2-19**] at 9:21. 
Portable semi-erect chest film, [**2203-2-19**] at 13:59, is submitted. 
IMPRESSION: 
Endotracheal tube and right internal jugular central line are unchanged in position.  The nasogastric tube has been advanced and now the tip is within the stomach and the side port is probably just beneath the gastroesophageal junction.  There has been interval improvement in mild pulmonary edema.  More focal patchy opacity at the left base persists which could reflect a combination of compressive atelectasis and/or pleural effusion, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to the airspace process."
"INDICATION:  47 year old man with trauma.  Now with chest pain and poor O2 sats. 
COMPARISON:  [**2124-9-14**]. 
CHEST AP:  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are within normal limits.  The pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable.  The lungs are clear.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  There are no pleural effusions.  There is a double density and crescentic lucency at the right hemidiaphragm for which a pneumoperitoneum cannot be excluded.  The osseous and soft tissue structures are stable in appearance. 
IMPRESSION:  Apparent lucency adjacent to right hemidiaphragm, possibly projectional, but cannot exclude pneumoperitoneum.  Recommend lateral decubitus view of abdomen for further evaluation. This finding was discussed with the primary team at the time of interpretation."
"INDICATION:  Head bleed, now with labored breathing. 
CHEST X-RAY, PORTABLE AP:  Comparison made to prior study of [**2169-11-30**]. 
CHEST X-RAY, PORTABLE AP:  There is a right internal jugular central venous line with tip in the mid superior vena cava.  A Dobhoff tube is present with tip in the stomach. There is obscuration of the diaphragm with diffuse increased density in the lower lung zones, consistent with layering pleural effusions.  These do not appear significantly changed in the interval. Opacity is present in the left retrocardiac region, likely representing atelectasis. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. 
IMPRESSION: Bilateral pleural effusions, without significant change from [**2169-11-30**]. Bibasiler atelectasis."
"INDICATION:  AML status post bone marrow transplant.  Admitted with RSV pneumonia. 
COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, [**2133-2-9**].  Chest CT, [**2133-2-3**].

There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is no pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Improvement in previously seen right-sided pneumonias. 2.  Stable left opacification is likely a persistent pneumonia."
"CHEST 1 VIEW PORTABLE: 
INDICATION:  [**Age over 90 **] y/o woman with sepsis, shortness of breath, worsening oxygenation. 
COMMENTS:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest is reviewed, and compared with the previous study of [**2129-12-9**]. 
There is slight increase in congestive heart failure with cardiomegaly and small bilateral pleural effusion.  There is increased opacity in the right lower lobe, which is probably due to atelectasis.  The possibility of superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded.  The right jugular IV catheter terminates in the superior vena cava.  No pneumothorax is seen. 
There is evidence of G tube overlying the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. 
IMPRESSION: 
Slightly worsening congestive heart failure with cardiomegaly.  Right lower lobe opacity, atelectasis vs. pneumonia."
"STUDY:  Single portable AP chest radiograph. 
INDICATION:  CVA, on permanent tracheostomy with intermittent hypotension. 
COMPARISON:  CT chest [**2162-6-13**], chest radiograph [**2162-6-10**]. 
FINDINGS:  Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are consistent with previous coronary artery bypass grafting.  Despite mild lordotic positioning the cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  There is a right-sided pacemaker with single lead terminating in the right atrium.  There is no evidence of acute pulmonary edema.  There is a moderate-to-large right pleural effusion and a smaller left effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  The hilar structures appear within normal limits.  Tracheostomy tube remains in expected position. 
IMPRESSION:  Pleural effusions as before without evidence of acute pulmonary edema."
"PORTABLE CHEST [**2188-7-6**] AT 12:47. 
INDICATION:  Fever. 
COMPARISON:  [**2188-7-5**] at 18:24. 
FINDINGS:  At the right lung base there is increased patchiness visualized in a somewhat linear fashion.  The latter feature suggests atelectasis although pneumonia could be present.  The retrocardiac density remains unchanged and may represent pneumonia as well.  The level of inspiration is quite shallow as was seen on the prior film.  Lines and tubes remain in place and there is no PTX. 
IMPRESSION:  Increasing patchy density at the right lung base.  Persistent retrocardiac air space opacity.  Pneumonia versus atelectasis."
"INDICATION:  Status post CABG, evaluate for effusion. 
VIEWS:  Standard PA and left lateral view, compared with AP erect view from [**2197-11-6**]. 
FINDINGS:  Again seen are median sternotomy wires and CABG clips.  There has been interval removal of the right internal jugular pulmonary artery catheter.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Again seen is stable left ventricular enlargement without evidence of vascular engorgement.  The mediastinum is stably widened.  Again seen is left lower lobe atelectasis.  There has been interval improvement in the aeration of the right lower lobe.  A tiny left pleural effusion is also present. 
IMPRESSION:

FINDINGS:  The right internal jugular venous catheter remains in unchanged and satisfactory position.  The heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  There is unchanged prominence of the interstitial markings and alveolar opacities bilaterally in the lungs, consistent with possible pulmonary edema.  The appearance of the bilateral layering pleural effusions is stable.  The appearance of an implant in the left breast with an associated calcified rim is unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.  Surrounding osseous structures and soft tissues are unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change."
"AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH 
INDICATION:  68-year-old woman with decreased breath sounds on the left and paradoxical movement of the left hemidiaphragm. 
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated [**2174-4-29**] and CT chest dated [**5-6**], [**2174**]. 
FINDINGS:  Compared to scout of the recent chest CT, cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Right lung remains clear.  There is no significant change in size or appearance of moderate left pleural effusion, better assessed on the recent chest CT.  No new air pockets. There is an underlying compressive atelectasis at the left base.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal. 
IMPRESSION:  Unchanged appearance of moderate left pleural effusion from [**5-6**], [**2174**], better delineated on the chest CT.  Probably unchanged degree of underlying compressive atelectasis."
"INDICATION:  Known aspergilloma and COPD with recent blood transfusion. 
CHEST X-RAY, PORTABLE AP:  Comparison made to prior study of one day earlier. There is a right internal jugular central venous line, which is unchanged in position with tip in the mid superior vena cava.  An endotracheal tube is present with tip at the thoracic inlet.  There is a nasogastric tube, which is curled in the stomach.  There is unchanged appearance of the right lung, with cystic spaces and irregular opacity consistent with patient's known diagnosis of aspergilloma.  There is interval improved aeration in the left lower lobe with decreased patchy opacities.  Persistent emphysema is seen in the left upper lobe. 
IMPRESSION: 
Interval improved aeration of the left lower lobe."
"CLINICAL HISTORY:  ICD placement. 
FINDINGS:  Two views of the chest are compared to portable examination from [**2193-8-16**].  There has been placement of a permanent pacemaker with the atrial lead ending lower than normally seen and the ventricular lead ending more superior than normally seen.  No pneumothorax.  Unchanged, moderately enlarged cardiac silhouette. 
Overlying soft tissues prevent full evaluation of the vertebral bodies, however, there is some suggestion of sclerosis of the lumbar vertebrae.  An AP and lateral view of the lumbar spine would be of utility. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Placement of permanent pacemaker without complications.  No pneumothorax. 2.  Possible sclerosis of the lumbar vertebral bodies should be confirmed with conventional spine radiographs."
"INDICATION:  29-year-old man with leukemia status post bone marrow transplant and intubated. 
COMPARISON:  [**2172-11-30**]. 
AP SUPINE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There has been interval increase in hazy opacification through most of both lungs likely representing mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema not necessarily cardiac in origin.  Increased opacities in the right lower lung and left lower lung represent atelectasis or pneumonia. Heart size is normal and stable.  Right upper lobe atelectasis is slightly increased compared to the prior exam. 
Endotracheal tube measures only 5 cm above the carina, but 2 cm above the  clavicles, higher than optimal.  Left dual-lumen central venous line is in standard placement. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Slightly high endotracheal tube. 2.  Progressive mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. 3.  Increased right upper lung atelectasis."
"CHEST RADIOGRAPH 
TECHNIQUE:  Single AP semi-erect portable radiograph of the chest was compared with prior chest radiographs from [**2139-10-5**] to [**2139-10-6**]. 
FINDINGS: 
Right PICC line ends at mid SVC, endotracheal tube terminates 4.5 cm above the carina, and orogastric tube passes into the stomach, however, the distal end of OGT is off  radiograph view.  Bilateral lung bases are remarkable for mild opacity with obscuration of the costophrenic angle suggesting minimal pleural effusions and bibasal atelectasis, new since [**2139-10-6**].  Upper lungs are clear, no discrete lung opacities concerning for pneumonia.  Normal heart size.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. 
IMPRESSION:  Minimal bibasal atelectasis and mild bilateral pleural effusions are new since [**2139-10-6**].  No discrete lung opacities concerning for pneumonia."
"INDICATION:  68 y/o woman with diabetes, VP shunt and multilobular pneumonia with acute hypoxia and shortness of breath. 
COMPARISON:  [**2127-1-31**]. 
CHEST, SINGLE VIEW:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable in a patient status post CABG.  There has been marked interval worsening of the bilateral patchy and confluent air space opacities.  There are no definite pleural effusions.  The soft tissue and osseous structures are unremarkable. A VP shunt is noted in apparently unchanged positioning. 
IMPRESSION:  1)  These findings most likely represent a pulmonary multifocal pneumonia.  Much less likely asymmetrical pulmonary edema."
"INDICATION:  Mental status change after ERCP. 
COMPARISON:  None. 
TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT. 
FINDINGS:  There is no hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, hydrocephalus, or acute vascular territorial infarct.  Mineralization in both basal ganglia is incidentally noted.  There are periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensities, which are consistent with small vessel ischemic disease. A small lacune of the right caudate head is noted.  There is calcification within both cavernous internal carotid arteries. Note is made of mucosal thickening which is moderate along the posterior aspect of the left maxillary sinus.

"INDICATION:  Interstitial pulmonary disease, new line placement. 
COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from 7:41 this morning. 
SINGLE PORTABLE AP SUPINE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Again seen are the bilateral multifocal alveolar opacities, there may have been slight worsening of these since the prior study.  The endotracheal tube is at the thoracic inlet, the nasogastric tube tip is in the fundus.  The tip of the new right subclavian central venous catheter is not well visualized but is likely at the cavoatrial junction.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax. 
IMPRESSION:  New right subclavian central venous line with its tip likely at the cavoatrial junction.  No pneumothorax.  Persistent bilateral multifocal alveolar opacities, which may have slightly worsened in the interim."
"INDICATION:  77-year-old man status post right upper lobectomy with two chest tubes in place.  Evaluate for pneumothorax. 
COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest x-ray dated [**2146-2-3**]. 
AP SEMI-UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY:  Two chest tubes terminate within the area of the right lung apex.  No pneumothorax is identified on this semi-upright film.  There is prominent right thoracic subcutaneous emphysema extending up into the neck.  Right thoracic pleural thickening suggests a tiny layering pleural effusion.  The trachea deviates slightly to the right.  The left lung is clear.

An additional 14-mm hyperdensity in the right frontal lobe slightly more inferior also appears unchanged.  No new intracranial hemorrhage is identified.  No shift of normally midline structures is noted.  No skull fractures identified. 
IMPRESSION:  Two foci of intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the right frontal lobe appear unchanged in size during the short interval."
"INDICATION:  Status post PICC placement, assess position. 
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from [**2106-1-29**]. 
FINDINGS:  The left PICC ends in the high SVC.  The right lateral lung is not included on this radiograph.  There is unchanged mild cardiomegaly.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  There is no pneumothorax identified.  The right mid-lower lung opacities are unchanged while the left mid-lower lung opacities have improved. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Unchanged right mid-lower lung opacities and improved left mid-lower lung opacities, may be secondary to pulmonary edema and/or pneumonia.  Recommend followup imaging to distinguish between these entities. 2.  Unchanged mild cardiomegaly. 3.  Left PICC ending in high SVC. 
These findings were reported to the IV nurse at 10:40 a.m. via telephone on the day of the study."
"INDICATION: Status post AVR and CABG.  Evaluate for aspiration. 
TECHNIQUE: Video oropharyngeal swallow was performed in conjunction with speech therapy.  Barium of different consistencies was administered.

In the pharyngeal phase, there is decreased larngeal elevation and absent epiglottic deflection.  There is residue in the vallecula especially with solids.  Residue partially clears.  The pharngeal contraction is decreased and symmetric.  There is penetration and trace aspiration especially with thins and to a lesser degree with nectar. 
IMPRESSION: Decreased laryngeal elevation and epiglottic deflection with residue in the vallecula especially with solids and penetration/trace aspiration especially with thins.  For futher details, refer to report from speech therapy."
"INDICATION: Line placement, assess position of triple-lumen catheter. 
FINDINGS: A right internal jugular vein approach central venous line is identified seen to overlie the SVC and to terminate in the lower SVC just above the expected level of the right atrium. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or any other placement-related complication. Comparison is made with a previous PA and lateral chest examination of [**2158-4-24**], which was a preoperative examination. Comparison demonstrates that a plate atelectasis has developed in the left lower lobe area partially in retrocardiac position. There is no other sign of any new infiltrate or CHF. 
IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated placement of central venous line."
"INDICATION:  Cerebral hemorrhage status-post nasogastric tube placement. 
Comparison: [**2182-7-7**] 
SEMI-UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The nasogastric tube is present with tip in the fundus of the stomach, in satisfactory position. A VP shunt is again identified. The heart is stablely enlarged with a left ventricular predominance. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There has been interval worsening of patchy opacity seen within the left lower lobe consistent with probable worsening atelectasis and/or infiltrate. Small left pleural effusion is present. The right lung is grossly clear. No pneumothorax is seen. Pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits. 
IMPRESSION: 1) Satisfactory placement of nasogastric tube. 2) Interval worsening of patchy opacity within the left lower lobe, likely representing atelectasis and/or infiltrate. Small left pleural effusion."
"Compared to [**2133-1-20**] and [**2133-2-1**]. 
CLINICAL INDICATION:  Status post craniotomy procedure.  Question pneumonia. 
The cardiac silhouette is enlarged and there is increased pulmonary vascularity caliber.  Bibasilar pulmonary opacities are again demonstrated with adjacent pleural effusions, and appear unchanged.  There is a patchy rounded opacity in the right upper lobe anteriorly with an equivocal area of cavitation.  This appears unchanged in retrospect from [**2133-2-1**] but is new compared to [**2133-1-20**].  The lung volumes appear increased.  The skeletal structures are unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION: Stable findings which likely represent CHF superimposed upon emphysema with associated small pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis. 
More focal right upper lobe opacity with questionable cavitation, which could represent a focal necrotizing pneumonia.

NON-CONTRAST CT SCAN OF THE HEAD: There is a moderate-sized right frontal lobe parenchymal hematoma and hemorrhage.  There is considerable hemorrhage within the ventricular system. There also is substantial subarachnoid hemorrhage which is visualized and is lowest in the foramen magnum.  There is a mild subfalcine herniation from right to left associated with the parenchymal hemorrhage.  There is some motion artifact making it difficult to assess the [**Doctor Last Name 37**]-white interface. Definite large territorial infarct is not clearly identified. 
IMPRESSION:  Extensive hemorrhage and hematoma formation within the cranial cavity as described.  Results called to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 33985**]."
"HISTORY:  65-year-old woman with new slurred speech after fall and bilateral frontal contusions.

"FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH 
INDICATION:  Respiratory distress.  Evaluate for pulmonary pathology. 
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, [**2106-2-1**] AT 09:33. 
FINDINGS:  Upright portable chest radiograph was obtained at 3:15 p.m. on [**7-3**], [**2106**].  This demonstrates unchanged consolidation in the left lower zone. Some left basal atelectasis is also evident.  Mild residual infiltrate in the right lower zone is essentially unchanged.  Calcification along the right diaphragmatic pleura is evident.  Sternotomy sutures are seen.  No obvious pneumothorax is evident.  Blunting of left costophrenic angle likely reflects a persistent small effusion.  Degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine. 
IMPRESSION:  Overall, similar appearance to prior examination with left greater than right basal infiltrates.  Also small left pleural effusion."
"AP PORTABLE CHEST: 
INDICATION:  CHF and renal failure status post intubation. 
The study is compared with earlier AP portable chest of [**2179-8-31**]. 
FINDINGS:  An ET tube is now seen with its tip 4 cm above the carina.  Again is seen a central venous line with left subclavian approach with its tip in the proximal SVC. 
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  There is no interval change since the earlier examination done on the same day.  Again is noted a large heart with bilateral pulmonary congestion consistent with CHF and pulmonary edema. 
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Bilateral pulmonary congestion and alveolar opacities consistent with CHF and pulmonary edema."
"AP CHEST, 1:59 P.M., [**9-8**]. 
HISTORY:  Delirium, suspect pneumonia. 
IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of any prior chest imaging: 
The sharp margin of the region of consolidation in the infrahilar left lower lobe suggests this is atelectasis rather than pneumonia, but does not really exclude infection.  There are no other regions of lung which are suspicious for pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion and the heart is normal size. The mediastinum is probably widened at the level of the aortic arch, but it is difficult to separate the edge of the mediastinal soft tissues from large thoracic vertebral osteophytes deviating the paraspinal line.  When feasible, upright conventional views should be obtained to see if there is really mediastinal adenopathy."
"INDICATION:  Status post hemicraniectomy.  Evaluate pneumocephalus. 
COMPARISON:  Numerous prior head CTs with most current recent exam dated [**2150-1-11**]. 
TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.

"PA and lateral chest [**2194-1-21**] compared to previous study of [**2194-1-15**]. 
CLINICAL INDICATION:  Preoperative assessment prior to coronary bypass surgery. 
FINDINGS: 
The heart is upper limits of normal and size.  The aorta is mildly tortuous and the pulmonary vascularity is normal.  The lungs appear clear, and there are no pleural effusions.  Skeletal structures reveal degenerative changes in the spine and a mild compression deformity in the midthoracic spine.  The latter is stable dating back to [**2188-4-18**] radiograph. 
Finally, note is made of biapical thickening, right greater than left, stable dating back to [**2188-4-18**] and attributed to scarring. 
IMPRESSION: 
Stable chest radiographic appearance with no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process."
"INDICATION:  Postoperative film after excision of right atrial mass. 
COMPARISONS:  PA and lateral from [**2146-11-29**]. 
SINGLE VIEW CHEST, AP:  The endotracheal tube is approximately 2 cm above the thoracic inlet, and should be advanced.  This is a suboptimal film secondary to the left hemithorax being partially obscured by breast tissue.  There is evidence of right upper lobe atelectasis.  The right internal jugular central line is seen terminating within the mid SVC.  Patient is status post median sternotomy with sternal wires and skin staples. 
IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube approximately 2 cm above the thoracic inlet and further advancement would be beneficial.  Atelectasis within the right upper lobe. Suboptimal film due to obscuration of the left hemithorax.  If clinically indicated, a repeat film is required.  These findings were called to the ICU where the patient was being cared for."
"REASON FOR THE EXAMINATION:  This is a 33-year-old man with new right kidney transplant with proteinuria.  The request is to perform a right transplant kidney biopsy.

DATE OF EXAM:  [**2137-11-29**]. 
INDICATION:  81-year-old male with CLL, with new-onset weakness and decreased breath sounds in the lung bases bilaterally. 
FINDINGS:  As seen on [**2137-11-26**], there is a large right-sided pleural effusion, and a small-to-moderate left pleural effusion.  The airspace within the right lung base and retrocardiac region cannot be evaluated due to underlying effusions, and therefore pneumonia is not excluded.  The upper lungs are better aerated.  The right IJ central venous catheter tip projects at the SVC/right atrial junction.  There is no pneumothorax.  The previously seen possible lucencies within the left clavicle and scapula are not included on this film.  Osseous structures are otherwise unchanged. 
IMPRESSION:  Stable large right and moderate left pleural effusions."

INDICATION:  75-year-old man status post extubation. 
TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright radiograph of chest.  Comparisons were made with prior chest radiographs through [**2189-8-16**] with the most recent from [**2189-8-31**]. 
FINDINGS:  Since [**2189-8-31**], the endotracheal tube and orogastric tubes have been removed.  Right central line ends at the cavoatrial junction. Bilateral lung volumes are low and since [**2189-8-31**] there is interval development of bilateral diffuse lung opacities and is likely moderate pulmonary edema.  Increased retrocardiac density on the left side suggesting left lower lung atelectasis is overall unchanged.  Presence of pleural effusion if any bilaterally is indeterminate due to diffuse bilateral opacity. Heart size is top normal and stable.

Again seen is left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  There is new opacity at the right base, likely representing an element of consolidation, with new prominence of the right hilum. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Left PICC line extending into neck and should be replaced. 
2.  Continued left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. 
3.  New opacity right base, likely representing atelectasis - - new compared with [**2178-11-14**]. 
Findings called to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3313**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12391**], at 11:51 a.m. on Sunday, [**2178-11-15**]."
"HISTORY:  53-year-old man status post thoracotomy and right upper lobectomy. Assess for interval change. 
COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph from [**2195-9-1**]. 
FINDINGS:  Diffuse, bilateral, poorly marginated airspace opacities are not appreciably changed.  This is most likely multifocal pneumonia.  There are no pleural effusions.  Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Postoperative changes including chest wall resection and right apical pleural fluid are unchanged. 
Dobbhoff tube has been removed and replaced with a nasogastric tube which ends in the stomach.  Tracheostomy tube and right internal jugular central venous line are in appropriate position and unchanged. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Multifocal opacity, likely infectious, and not significantly changed. 2.  Stable post- operative changes."
"INDICATIONS:  A 75-year-old man intubated, with increasing leukocytosis and fever.  Question pneumonia. 
CHEST, AP PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT:  Comparison is made to the prior day, also with limited review of a recent CT from [**2124-1-20**].  The patient remains intubated.  The endotracheal tube again terminates at the carina.  A nasogastric tube passes into the stomach, although its distal course is not well visualized for technical reasons.  The lung volumes are low, and the film lordotic in orientation.  Persistent bibasilar opacities are present, most suggestive of atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax, definite effusion or pulmonary edema. 
IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube terminating at the carina.  Probable bibasilar atelectasis.  Discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 256**] at 1 p.m. on [**2124-1-25**]."
"PORTABLE AP CHEST: 
INDICATION:  Right pleural decortication.  Assess feeding tube position. 
COMPARISON:  [**2139-5-12**]. 
FINDINGS:  Tracheostomy tube, three right-sided chest tubes, right subclavian central venous line, and Dobbhoff tube are all in unchanged position.  The patient is s/p CABG and several small clips are seen in the mid abdomen as well.  Staples overlie the right lateral chest wall.  The heart and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  There is a possible increase in size of the right pleural effusion.  The left lung remains relatively clear.  A pneumothorax is not appreciated.  The bones are grossly unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION:  Slight interval increase in size of right pleural effusion. Tubes and lines unchanged."
"CHEST RADIOGRAPH 
INDICATIONS:  Status post recent coronary bypass graft surgery.  Study performed to assess nasogastric tube placement. 
FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  A nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach.  If clinically indicated, however, advancing the tube somewhat is suggested in order to gain greater purchase into the stomach, noting that the visible sidehole projects near the gastroesophageal junction.  Persistent medial lower lung opacities are most compatible with minor atelectasis.  There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A right jugular central venous catheter is unchanged. 
IMPRESSION:  Nasogastric tube terminating in the stomach and advancing it somewhat is recommended to gain greater purchase into the stomach."
"HISTORY:  Right iliac stent. 
FINDINGS:  The current study is viewed in conjunction to prior exam of [**2180-9-4**].  Stent placement has occurred on the right.  Currently Doppler evaluation shows monophasic wave forms at all levels on the right.  The ABI is .43 based on the PT artery and .39 based on the DP artery.  The left lower extremity was not interrogated.  The volume recording demonstrates wave form widening from the low thigh, distally.  At the metatarsal level on the right the amplitude is only 6 mm. 
IMPRESSION:  No appreciable change compared to the exam of [**2180-9-4**] ie., no change in ABI, volume recordings or diffuse monphasic wave forms on the right."
"[**2120-4-22**] 
INDICATION:  Status-post pancreas transplant. 
Comparison is made to a chest radiograph from approximately 8 hours earlier. 
AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There has been interval insertion of a right internal jugular central venous line with the tip in the mid-right atrium. The nasogastric tube tip is below the diaphragm, along with a sideport. Heart size appears slightly more generous, but is likely within normal limits due to differences in technique. There is also increased prominence of the pulmonary vasculature. There is also mild decrease in lung volumes, likely due to inspiratory effort. Findings may indicate aggressive fluid administration during surgery. No pleural effusions are identified. Osseous structures are unchanged. 
IMPRESSION:   Lines and tubes as above. Slight prominence of pulmonary vasculature may be related to aggressive fluid administration."
"HISTORY:  Screening.  Mother with breast and ovarian CA.  Sister with breast CA.  Implants placed [**2116**]. 
DIGITAL SCREENING MAMMOGRAPHY INTERPRETED WITH CAD.  There are bilateral prepectoral/subglandular silicone prostheses.  These have irregular thickened and calcified capsules, but no overt leak into the surrounding tissues.  The hard non-movable implants make push-back views difficult or impossible to obtain with two additional images on the left and one on the right.  Scattered fibroglandular densities with no dominant mass or architectural distortion identified and no clustered microcalcifications.  Appearance is unchanged from [**2148-10-2**]. 
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of malignancy.  [**Hospital1 **]-RADS 2 - benign findings. Implants with severe capsular fibrosis.  Consideration should be given to annual mammography given this patient's family history."
"INDICATIONS:  86 y/o man with crit drop intubated for respiratory distress. 
PORTABLE AP CHEST:  Comparison is made to study of [**2117-2-16**].  There is placement of endotracheal tube with tip in the right mainstem bronchus.  This tube should be pulled back 3 to 4 cm.  The heart size is stable.  There is no redistribution of the pulmonary vasculature.  There is increased expansion of the right lower lobe and decrease in the size of the right sided pleural effusion.  A small amount of new atelecatsis/consolidation is seen in the left lung base.  High density contrast material is again overlying the right lower lobe, suggesting prior aspiration of contrast material. 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Right mainstem bronchus intubation. 2.  No evidence for worsening left heart failure."
"INDICATION:  Postmenopausal. 
COMPARISON:  [**2105-12-18**]. 
FINDINGS:  Note is again made of a levoconvex scoliosis as well as degenerative changes of the lumbar spine, which may overestimate bone density. The bone mineral density from L1 through L4 is 1.2 g/cm2, resulting in a T-score of -0.2 and a Z-score of 0.8.  This represents a non-significant increase from the comparison study of 0.8%, an increase from baseline in [**2099**] of 0.7%. 
In the femoral necks, the mean bone mineral density is 0.83 g/cm2, resulting in a T-score of -1.5 and a Z-score of -0.4.  This represents a non-significant increase of 1.6% from the comparison study in [**2104**] and a decrease of 3% from the baseline study in [**2099**]. 
IMPRESSION:  Bone mineral density in the femoral necks corresponding to osteopenia and normal bone mineral density in the lumbar spine."
"INDICATION:  COPD, hypoxia, shortness of breath, bilateral lower extremity edema. 
Portable AP view of the chest dated [**2168-8-17**] is compared with the same examination from [**2168-8-8**].  There is stable cardiomegaly.  There is bilateral peribronchial cuffing in upper lung zone redistribution indicative of mild congestive heart failure, slightly worsened in the interim.  There is possibly a small left pleural effusion.  The right lung is grossly clear.  There is no pneumothorax or evidence for focal lung consolidation.  The surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION:  Slight worsening of CHF since the prior exam with possible small left pleural effusion.  Stable cardiomegaly."
"LEFT FEMUR, TWO VIEWS. 
INDICATION:  Status post ORIF of a left femur periprosthetic fracture. 
COMPARISON:  Left hip radiograph, [**2138-11-5**]. 
FINDINGS: Two AP views of the left femur demonstrate three fixation plates with multiple screws and cerclage wires transfixing a comminuted fracture of the proximal left femur diaphysis involving the greater trochanter.  The fracture fragments are in near anatomic alignment, and the fracture line is still visible in the current study.  Soft tissue swelling and lateral skin staples are noted. 
IMPRESSION:  Unchanged appearance of a left periprosthetic femoral fracture, without hardware-related complications."
"STUDY:  Single portable AP chest radiograph. 
INDICATION:  Shortness of breath. 
COMPARISON:  None. 
FINDINGS:  There is mild cardiomegaly.  Tortuosity of the thoracic aorta is noted and stable since study from [**2198-3-14**]. Retrocardiac opacity is most consistent with atelectasis. There is a small to moderate right pleural effusion.  There is no radiographic evidence of pneumonia. 
Incidentally noted is a sclerotic lesion within the left proximal humerus measuring 2.4 cm also noted on remote study from [**2191-5-17**] and possibly representing an enchondroma. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Left lower lobe atelectasis and right small to moderate pleural effusion. No radiographic evidence of pneumonia. 
Sclerotic focus within the left proximal humerus also noted on prior remote study from [**2191**] which is not fully characterized and may represent an enchondroma."
"PORTABLE CHEST OF [**2160-9-16**] 
COMPARISON:  [**2160-9-14**]. 
INDICATION:  Evaluate pleural effusions. 
The patient is status post median sternotomy.  Various lines and tubes remain in place, with apparent interval repositioning of [**1-6**] left-sided chest tubes. A nasogastric tube has been withdrawn slightly in the interval and coils in the fundus of the stomach.  Remaining intrathoracic devices are in satisfactory position. 
There has been interval development of a small left pneumothorax with apical and basilar components.  There is stable cardiomegaly.  Bibasilar atelectatic changes are evident, with interval improving aeration in the left lower lobe. Small right pleural effusion is noted and is not significantly changed compared to earlier studies of [**2160-9-14**]. 
IMPRESSION:  New small left pneumothorax."
"HISTORY:  Right upper quadrant pain and MRCP evidence of mildly dilated common bile duct and two cysts in tail of pancreas. 
Eight fluoroscopic scout films are provided. There is contrast filling of the common bile duct, common hepatic duct, right and left hepatic ducts and several intrahepatic biliary divisions.  There is also filling of an intact cystic duct remnant. 
There is mild dilatation of common bile duct but no focal strictures or calculi are detected. 
There is contrast filling of the pancreatic duct and a few side branches. The duct is visualized to the tail of the pancreas.  It is normal in caliber, course and contour. Specifically, no strictures, filling defects or communication with cystic structures. 
IMPRESSION:  Mild dilatation of common bile duct. Normal pancreatic duct."
"AP CHEST 8:28 P.M. on [**6-14**]: 
HISTORY:  Lymphoma and worsening clinical exam.  Possible pneumonia. 
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**6-6**] through 9: 
Diffuse interstitial pulmonary abnormality has developed since [**6-13**], because of its rapidity it is likely edema, either volume related or due to non-cardiogenic causes such as blood product transfusion or drug reaction. Small bilateral pleural effusions persist.  The left suprahilar opacification which would otherwise raise concern for pneumonia was also present on [**6-11**] when edema was seen, has subsequently cleared on [**6-13**].  Heart size is normal."
"INDICATION:  Status post chest tube, now on waterseal.  Question pneumothorax. 
COMPARISON:  [**2138-6-22**] at 7:14 a.m. 
FINDINGS:  The right chest tube appears to be withdrawn in position compared to the prior, with a sideport likely lying outside of the pleura.  No residual pneumothorax can be identified.  Perihilar haze indicates unchanged fluid overload.  There is a new retrocardiac opacity that may represent atelectasis or pneumonia in the proper clinical setting.  There is also a new left pleural effusion. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Right chest tube sideport likely lies outside of the pleural cavity without evidence for pneumothorax. 2.  New retrocardiac opacity and left pleural effusion. 3.  Unchanged fluid overload."
"HISTORY:  AML.   Bone marrow transplant.  Respiratory distress. 
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to chest films since [**10-26**], most recently [**10-28**]. 
There has been substantial improvement in pulmonary edema from the left lung and a decrease in pleural effusions, now only small to moderate in volume. However, there has been substantial increase in consolidation in the right lower lobe suggesting progressive pneumonia as well as the aggregate of nodules in the left upper and right perihilar lung.  The latter are strongly suggestive of fungal or Nocardia infection.  The former may be pyogenic. Heart size is top normal.  ET tube is in standard placement and bilateral central venous catheters in the SVC, as before."
"INDICATION: 58 year old man status post left carotid endarterectomy today, not waking up. 
TECHNIQUE: Axial images of the brain were obtained without intravenous contrast. 
No prior studies are available for comparison. 
CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is loss of [**Doctor Last Name 181**]/white matter differentiation in the left hemisphere involving portions of the frontal,parietal,temporal and occipital lobes. There is no significant surrounding edema. There is no intra or extraaxial hemorrhage. There is no shift of normal midline structures. There is slight asymmetry of the lateral ventricles but the overall ventricular size is normal. There is a lacune in the left frontal corona radiata. Osseous structures, paranasal sinuses and soft tissue structures are unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION: Evolving infarct of the left hemisphere."
"AP CHEST, 11:15 PM ON [**2-21**] 
HISTORY:  Central line pulled back. 
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to 10:36 a.m.: 
Left internal jugular line projects over the upper SVC.  ET tube, now less than 5 cm above the upper margin of the clavicles and 8 cm from the carina has been repositioned due to findings on subsequent chest radiographs and conversations with the clinician following this study.  Left lower lobe collapse and moderate left pleural effusion have increased.  Small right pleural effusion is suspected as well.  The heart is enlarged but margins are obscured and comparison is not possible.  No pneumothorax."
"CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 57-year-old female liver donor with persistent nausea and vomiting.  Assess for gastric outlet obstruction. 
FINDINGS: 
Limited double contrast upper GI was performed as the patient could not tolerate sufficient volume of barium by mouth.  Barium passes freely through the esophagus.  There are normal primary peristaltic contractions.  No gross mucosal abnormalities are identified.  No free gastroesophageal reflux is observed during the study.  There is a normal gastric rugal fold pattern.  The stomach empties promptly into the small bowel.  Duodenal bulb and sweep appear grossly normal. 
IMPRESSION: 
Normal, limited double contrast upper GI.  No evidence of gastric outlet obstruction."
"PA AND LATERAL CHEST: 
CLINICAL INDICATION:   Dyspnea and hypoxia. 
The heart is enlarged but stable in size.  There has been interval decrease in pulmonary vascular engorgement and perihilar haziness with some minimal residual perihilar haziness remaining.  There are confluent areas of increased opacity in the right upper lobe and in the left retrocardiac region. Previously present right lower lobe opacities have cleared in the interval.  A small left pleural effusion is unchanged. 
Overall, the right upper lobe opacity has worsened in the interval. 
IMPRESSION: 
Worsening right upper lobe opacity.  In the setting of signs of improving edema elsewhere in the lungs, interval worsening in this area raises the concern for evolving infectious pneumonia. 
Stable left retrocardiac opacity and adjacent left pleural effusion."
"SINGLE VIEW OF THE CHEST, [**2201-2-21**]. 
HISTORY:  89-year-old female with CHF and increasing dyspnea. 
FINDINGS:  Single bedside AP examination labeled ""upright at 17:25"" is compared with remote two-view study, dated [**2197-6-18**]; the overall appearance is not much changed.  There is minimal bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis or scarring.  No focal airspace process is seen.  The heart is unchanged in size, with no significant pulmonary vascular congestion, pleural effusion or other evidence of CHF.  There are atherosclerotic changes involving the thoracic aorta.  A probable tiny granuloma projects over the lateral aspect of the right second rib. 
IMPRESSION:  No acute process; specifically, there is no evidence of significant CHF."
"INDICATION:  Multiple myeloma with enterococcal empyema, evaluate for pneumothorax, infiltrate or effusion. 
COMPARISON:  [**2116-7-22**]. 
TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable supine chest. 
FINDINGS:  The tracheostomy tube is not visualized, possibly due to exclusion of the lung apices from the radiograph.  Left internal jugular venous access catheter and nasogastric tube appear in unchanged position, with NG tube terminating in a moderately distended stomach.  Right apical pneumothorax no longer visualized, although the right chest wall is partially excluded from the radiograph.  Bilateral pulmonary opacities appear slightly improved on the right.  Heart size and mediastinal contours appear unchanged.  Right pleural effusion unchanged. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Resolution of right pneumothorax. 2.  Unchanged right pleural effusion.  Improved diffuse consolidation within the right lung and stable left lung consolidation."
"HISTORY:  ARDS. 
Portable radiographs of the chest demonstrate patchy increased airspace opacity involving both lungs, worse in the left upper and right lower lungs. There is biapical pleural thickening.  No effusion detected.  Lung volumes are low to normal.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unremarkable.  Support lines are unchanged when compared to [**2122-1-24**].  There is marked osseous destruction involving the right glenohumeral joint.  The aorta is tortuous. 
IMPRESSION: 
Abnormal airspace opacities involving the bilateral lungs.  Diagnostic considerations again include pneumonia.  The findings are unchanged. 
Support lines unchanged. 
Marked osseous destruction of the right glenohumeral joint.  The finding may represent the remote sequela of trauma.  Neuropathic arthropathy can have a similar appearance.  The finding is unchanged when compared to multiple previous studies."
"AP CHEST, 12:52 A.M. ON [**11-14**] 
HISTORY:  Necrotizing pancreatitis and effusions. 
IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: 
Lung volumes are low.  Pleural effusion is moderate on the left, small on the right.  Opacification at the lung base is probably combination of mild edema and atelectasis.  Upper lungs clear.  Heart size normal.  Rightward displacement of the lower portion of the nasogastric tube may reflect low lung volumes or a space occupying process including esophageal distention or mediastinal phlegmon.  Correlation with abdominal CT scanning recommended. 
Tip of the left PIC catheter projects at the superior cavoatrial junction.  No pneumothorax."
"HISTORY: Status post off pump CABG. 
Chest effusions. 
CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. 
Compared with one day earlier, the ET tube and an NG tube have been removed. A left subclavian line is present, tip over distal SVC/RA junction.  This has been changed over from a Swan-Ganz catheter.  No pneumothorax is identified. Patient is status post sternotomy, with moderate cardiomegaly.  There has been slight interval improvement in the right sided pleural effusion, with underlying atelectasis.

History of renal cell carcinoma with known metastases to the lungs with worsening upper respiratory infection symptoms. 
COMPARISON:  Multiple chest CTs, most recent dated [**2110-12-30**]. 
FINDINGS:  The indistinct opacity of the medial left apex is again noted and consistent with the known metastatic disease.  Otherwise, no definite further pulmonary nodule or mass is seen.  There is no superimposed consolidation or edema.  There is mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits for size.  No effusion or pneumothorax is evident.  The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION:  No acute pulmonary process.  Known metastatic disease at the left apex."
"INDICATION:  Broken tip of the needle driver during the operation.  Question of foreign body seen within the operative area. 
FINDINGS: Two images given of the broken needle tip and one abdominal radiograph were submitted for review.  Abdominal radiograph demonstrates multiple surgical midline staples.  There is no radiopaque foreign body consistent with a broken tip of the needle driver.  This case was discussed at 3:40 AM on [**2157-3-10**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] by phone with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  No radiopaque foreign body consistent with the broken needle driver tip seen projecting over the abdomen."
"INDICATION:  49-year-old female with aspiration status post intubation. Evaluate ET tube placement. 
COMPARISON:  No prior study available for comparison. 
SUPINE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Evaluation is limited by various radiopaque objects.  Within this limitation, the endotracheal tube terminates 5 cm from the carina at the upper margin of the clavicles.  An NG tube is also noted in situ. Although the last side port is not clearly identified, the tip is in the mid-body of the stomach.  Lungs are clear.  There is no appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal silhouette, hilar contours, and pulmonary vasculature are unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION:

2)  NG tube in situ with distal end projecting over the left upper quadrant."
"PORTABLE CHEST ON [**2196-4-2**] at 6:11. 
INDICATION:  Trauma and suspicion for infiltrates. 
COMPARISON:  [**2196-4-1**] at 5:54. 
FINDINGS: 
Increased opacity at the right base in a linear configuration is most consistent with subsegmental atelectasis.  At the left lung base there is a less well-defined more patchy appearance which may be progressing since the prior study.  A developing pneumonia in this location should be considered and a follow up is recommended.  Right-sided CVL remains in place with no PTX and the NGT/ETT have both been removed.  Some increase in interstitial markings diffusely appears to be an interval change. 
IMPRESSION:  Some worsening of fluid status and concern for possible development of left lower lung field consolidation."
"HISTORY:  Right TMA, left foot osteomyelitis.  Right fem-tib bypass graft. 
FINDINGS/TECHNIQUE:  [**Doctor Last Name **] scale, color duplex, and spectral Doppler interrogation of the arteries of the lower extremities bilaterally was performed. 
RIGHT SIDE:  Interrogation of the femoral, popliteal, and dorsalis pedis arteries demonstrated triphasic blood flow.  Pulse volume recording on the right yielded highest amplitude in excess of 39 mm in the lower thigh. Segmental limb pressures were not recorded. 
LEFT SIDE:  Spectral Doppler interrogation of the femoral and popliteal arteries demonstrated triphasic blood flow, whereas interrogation of the posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis artery demonstrated monophasic blood flow. Segmental limb pressures on the left were not recorded due to noncompressibility of the vessels. 
IMPRESSION:  Patent right femoral-tibial bypass graft.  Vascular insufficiency on the left below the popliteal artery."
"INDICATION:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with shortness of breath and desaturation while in ED.  Question of flash pulmonary edema. 
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from [**2196-3-28**]. 
ONE VIEW OF THE CHEST: 
Evaluation of the lungs is limited due to low lung volumes and patient position.  Within these limitations, the lungs show mild pulmonary edema with mild bibasilar atelectasis.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  The mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  No definite pleural effusions are present.  A right-sided pacer terminates with leads in the right atrium and right ventricle.

Evaluation limited due to low lung volumes.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis and pulmonary edema."
"INDICATION:  A 64-year-old woman status post intubation, query tube position. 
COMPARISON:  [**2112-6-18**]. 
SINGLE PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  In this kyphotic view, the endotracheal tube is at the lower portion of the thoracic inlet and is probably in normal position.  Orogastric tube and side hole are coarse below the diaphragm and out of the field of view.  Median sternotomy wires are seen. Heart size is top normal given technique.  The mediastinum appears widened. There are ill-defined opacities throughout both lungs with a perihilar predominance.  There may be small pleural effusions.  There is no large pneumothorax. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Probably standard position of endotracheal tube.  Could consider PA and lateral for better definition. 
2.  Perihilar predominant, ill-defined airspace opacification suggests pulmonary edema.  Underlying infection cannot be excluded.  Could consider another film after diuresis."

Again noted is evidence of focal opacities in the right lower lobe, and the right upper lobe, which remain unchanged from the prior exam obtained nine hours earlier.  Again noted is left-sided central venous line, with the tip in the mid SVC, in good position.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The left CP angle is not included in the image. 
IMPRESSION:  The tip of the central venous line is in the mid SVC.  Otherwise, no significant change from the prior study."
"INDICATION:  Status post AAA repair, open abdomen, status post trach placement, evaluate right pleural effusion. 
SEMI-UPRIGHT AP OF THE CHEST:  A tracheostomy tube is again present with the tip terminating approximately 3 cm above the carina.  There is again note of a right internal jugular central venous catheter with the tip positioned in the contralateral brachiocephalic vein.  There is persistent left and right lower lobe collapse/consolidation with volume loss appreciated in the right lung. There are again present small bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the right side.  The right-sided effusion appears to be largely subpulmonic. 
IMPRESSION: 
1) No significant interval change of persistent bibasilar atelectasis and small effusions. 
2) Right internal jugular central venous line with tip in the contralateral brachiocephalic vein."
"INDICATION:  Enterocutaneous fistula, sepsis and respiratory failure.  New line placement. 
COMPARISON:  AP chest [**2188-12-13**]. 
AP CHEST:  The right IJ line has been replaced with a right subclavian line, the distal portion of which extends into the neck, likely within the right internal jugular vein.  The endotracheal tube lies 4 cm from the carina.  Two feeding tubes extend into the stomach.  There has been interval increase in vascular engorgement.  Layering bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. Increasing obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm suggests progressive consolidation. 
IMPRESSION:  1)  Malposition of right subclavian line.  This finding was discussed with the ordering physician. 
2)  Persistent bilateral pleural effusions and worsening right lung base consolidation. 
3)  Increasing vascular congestion, suggesting possible mild CHF."
"HISTORY:  This is a 23-year-old female with history of BOOP, end-stage renal disease status post missed hemodialysis session, here with cough. 
COMPARISON:  [**2117-3-13**]. 
CHEST PA AND LATERAL:  Heart is enlarged, with a prominent azygous vein, suggestive of a pericardial effusion. Otherwise, cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Surgical suture chain overlies the right mid lung. Hazy opacity in the right lower lobe may represent an early pneumonia. Slightly increased interstitial markings suggest mild fluid overload, without pulmonary edema.  There is no pleural effusion. Osseous structures are unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Early right lower lobe pneumonia. 2.  Pericardial effusion. 3.  Mild fluid overload."
"PROCEDURE:  Chest PA and lateral. 
REASON FOR EXAM:  82-year-old man with left lower lobe effusion, left VATS drainage and recent removal of Pleurx catheter. 
FINDINGS: Since the previous chest radiograph dated [**2176-7-9**], the left- sided pleural drain has been removed and the left sided effusion and left lower lobe opacities and atelectasis are unchanged. Increased ground-glass opacification in the right lower lobe may be partially accounted for by a reduced inspiratory effort with crowding of perivascular structures suggesting that the infrahilar airspace opacification is stable. Focal pleural thickening with left apical pleural calcification is unchanged. 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  The left Pleurx drain has been removed,no pneumothorax. 
2.  Persistent bibasilar and infrahilar opacities and left pleural effusion are remain stable."

FINDINGS:  [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 337**] of the right common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were performed.  Intraluminal thrombus is identified from the right common femoral vein to the level of the popliteal vein.  No color flow or Doppler waveforms are demonstrated in the common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins. 
IMPRESSION:  Right DVT extending from the common femoral vein to the popliteal vein."
"LEFT FOOT THREE VIEWS, [**2208-6-2**] AT 1734 HOURS 
HISTORY:  Left foot pain and redness. 
COMPARISON:  Multiple priors including most recently [**2208-5-23**]. 
FINDINGS:  Marked stability is again identified with severe endstage degenerative changes noted at the first metatarsophalangeal joint and fusion of the phalanges of multiple digits throughout the foot.  In particular, there is an area of lucency along the lateral head of the first metatarsal bone, which has been present at least dating back to [**2206-10-16**].  The regional soft tissues are relatively unremarkable.  Small plantar spur is evident.  No underlying fracture or dislocation is noted.  Global mineralization is diminished. 
IMPRESSION:  Markedly stable foot radiographs dating across multiple prior exams.  No acute changes to suggest underlying osteomyelitis.  If clinical suspicion remains high, consider MRI for more sensitive evaluation."
"INDICATION:  Bilateral lower extremity edema. 
COMPARISON:  Bilateral lower extremity DVT study, [**2135-10-13**]. 
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND:  Grayscale and Doppler ultrasound was performed on the right and left common femoral veins, superficial femoral veins, and popliteal veins.  There is limited evaluation of the distal superficial femoral vein due to the patient's extreme bilateral lower extremity swelling.  In the visualized veins, no intraluminal thrombus is seen.  Normal waveforms, compressibility, and augmentability were demonstrated.  There are also lymph nodes seen in the groin, the largest on the left measuring 1.6 cm and on the right measuring 3.5 cm. 
IMPRESSION:  No DVT identified of the right or left lower extremity. Prominent inguinal lymph nodes clinical corrleation is recommended."
"HISTORY:  CABG. 
FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of [**12-1**], there has been a CABG procedure performed with intact midline sternal wires.  Endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 4.2 cm above the carina.  Right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter tip is in the right pulmonary artery.  Nasogastric tube extends to the stomach with the side hole in the region of the esophagogastric junction.

3.  Stable mild pulmonary edema."
"INDICAITON: Assess for pleural effusion for layering. 
COMPARISON: Compared to one day earlier. 
CHEST, LEFT LATERAL DECUB: There is a large layering left pleural effusion. Note that there is persistent homogeneous increased density at the left base, such that the underlying parenchyma cannot be evaluated.  There is blunting of the right lateral costophrenic angle with poor definition of the right hemidiaphragm as previously noted, such that any right pleural fluid that may be present is not clearly freely layering. 
IMPRESSION: Large layering left pleural effusion as described."
"INDICATION:  Preoperative chest radiograph in patient with severe peripheral vascular disease. 
PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH OF [**2196-6-28**].  There are no previous exams available for comparison.

COMPARISON:  [**2150-9-21**]. 
NONCONTRAST HEAD CT:  There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or shift of normally midline structures.  The ventricles and cisterns are normal. The density values of the brain parenchyma are normal, with preservation of the [**Doctor Last Name **]-white differentiation.  Punctate hyperdense foci within the basal ganglia bilaterally likely represent calcifications that are unchanged from [**9-21**].  Mastoid air cells remain partially opacified.  There is improved aeration of the visualized portion of the paranasal sinuses. 
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.  Please note that MRI with diffusion weighting is more sensitive for the detection of acute ischemia."
"INDICATION:  Right upper lobectomy complicated by right middle lobe collapse. 
COMPARISON:  Radiographs dating back to the first postoperative radiograph of [**2191-3-28**] and most recently [**2191-4-4**]. 
FINDINGS:  The right lower lobe is hyperaerated as a result of right middle lobe collapse.  The convex lateral margin of the right paramediastinal density is unchanged since [**2191-4-4**] and better characterized on the chest CT of [**2191-3-27**] as collapsed right middle lobe which is abnormally thickened, likely due to torsion.  The cardiac size is normal.  The left lung is mildly atelectatic in its lower portion and relatively hyperinflated. 
IMPRESSION: Persistent right paramediastinal density with lateral convex margin, likely reflects right middle lobe torsion.  No interval change since [**2191-3-27**]."
"INDICATION:  History of paraspinal and epidural abscesses. 
AP AND LATERAL CERVICAL SPINE:  Comparison to the intraoperative lateral view of [**2148-9-10**], the bone graft material at the C6 level appears to have migrated anteriorly.  The alignment of the lower thoracic spine appears to be abnormal, with the C7 vertebral body anterior cortex projecting a vertebrae above.  The remaining vertebral bodies are in unchanged alignment. The C5 vertebral body is somewhat sclerotic, and there is persistent prevertebral soft tissue widening. 
IMPRESSION:  Probable anterior migration of C6 bone graft. The overall alignment of the lower cervical spine is probably abnormal, and some listhesis is probably present.  Prevertebral soft tissue widening is unchanged. The findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7792**] on [**2148-9-25**]."
"HISTORY:  Question pneumonia, evaluate pneumothorax, ?? _____Line ?? placement.

IMPRESSION: No definite fracture. If there is clinical suspicion for femoral neck or hip fracture, an MRI could be performed."
"Status post sternotomy and the presence of surgical clips in the anterior left mediastinum are indicative of previous bypass surgery.  Heart shadow is partially obcured by fat pads but no conclusive evidence of any significant cardiac enlargement is present.  Pulmonary vascular congestion is noted and the lateral and right-sided posterior pleural sinuses are free.  The left posterior pleural sinus is blunted but there is no conclusive evidence for any new parenchymal infiltrates in this or any other pulmonary region when comparing it with the next previous portable chest examination of [**2121-1-27**]. 
IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory postoperative chest findings without evidence of significant CHF or new acute parenchymal infiltrate.  Blunting of posterior left pleural sinus interpreted as postoperative scar formation or adhesion."
"INDICATION:  EVD, evaluate ventricles. 
COMPARISON:  [**2124-3-10**]. 
TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT. 
FINDINGS:  There is no significant difference in the appearance of the brain with diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Streak artifact from the endovascular coil precludes accurate assessment of the basilar cisterns and temporal lobes. 
The ventricles are unchanged in appearance, with blood layering in both occipital horns.  The ventricular shunt device is present entering a left frontal burr hole and terminating in the third ventricle. 
No new hemorrhage is identified.  There is partial opacification of the sphenoid sinuses, complete opacification of the right maxillary sinus, and partial opacification of the ethmoid and left maxillary sinus.  The mastoid air cells are predominantly occluded.

"HISTORY:  Newborn infant with respiratory distress. 
FINDINGS:  Portable AP chest, 2:03 a.m., [**2110-9-13**]. 
Lung volumes are lower limits of normal.  There is diffuse bilateral hazy lung opacity, with an appearance consistent with changes of RDS.  Lucency in the right mid/perihilar region is noted, and may represent a segment of asymmetrically aerated lung, versus a cystic lung lesion.  I doubt this represents pneumothorax.  Continued followup is necessary. 
The cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size.  No definite edema. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Changes of RDS. 2.  Cystic mid right lung lucency as described.  Followup is necessary, particularly after intubation, to assess the stability of this finding.  This was discussed in morning rounds."

INDICATION:  Stab wound. 
COMPARISON:  [**2156-12-4**]. 
FINDINGS: The endotracheal tube remains in place.  The right chest tube is stable in appearance.  The Dobbhoff catheter is seen curled upon itself in the expected location of the body/fundus of the stomach.  Compared to the prior study, there is better aeration of the right airspace disease.  Stable appearance to the left lower airspace disease, but a subtle increase is visualized in the left mid lung zone.  Heart and mediastinum are stable in appearance.  No pneumothorax. 
IMPRESSION:  Discrepant changes with improved aeration of the right lung and slight increase in opacity in the left mid lung."
"EXAM:  Right elbow, three views. 
CLINICAL INFORMATION:  78-year-old male with history of left elbow pain status post fall. 
COMPARISON:  None. 
FINDINGS:  Three views of the right elbow were obtained.  Please note that the lateral view is suboptimal due to patient positioning and if high clinical concern, suggest repeat.  Given the above, no definite acute fracture or dislocation is seen.  Enthesopathy is noted along the lateral epicondyle.  No definite joint effusion is seen, although the lateral view is suboptimal. There is no radiopaque foreign body. 
IMPRESSION:  Suboptimal lateral view due to patient positioning, if there is high clinical concern, suggest repeat.  Given this, no evidence of acute fracture or dislocation."

IMPRESSION: 
1.  Right internal jugular dialysis catheter again having its tip within the right atrium in similar position as compared to multiple prior studies.  There is increasing bibasilar and perihilar airspace opacities, which likely reflect worsening moderate pulmonary edema.  There are likely layering effusions, left greater than right.  Diffuse pneumonia would be less likely given the rapidity of interval change.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged, with the heart being stably enlarged."
"INDICATION:  Recent insertion of peripherally inserted central venous catheter. 
COMPARISON:  Prior radiographs dating back to [**2107-10-10**] and most recently [**2107-10-14**]. 
FINDINGS:  A right upper extremity peripherally inserted central venous catheter tip is projected over the expected location of mid SVC, in satisfactory position. 
Right mid zone linear atelectasis is stable.  Moderate cardiomegaly and marked bilateral pulmonary arterial enlargement is supported by a CT thorax dated [**2107-10-11**], to account for the marked right hilar opacity.  There is no evidence of acute consolidation or pleural effusion. 
IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory position of peripherally inserted central venous catheter. 
Marked cardiomegaly and enlargement of both pulmonary arteries."

TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright. 
FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is persistent predominantly central opacification of each lung, most suggestive of moderate interstitial pulmonary edema.  Two streaky opacities projecting over the left mid lung suggest minor atelectasis.  Overall, there has been some improvement. To some extent medial patchy opacities projecting over each hemidiaphragm may also reflect minor atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.  A small pleural effusion is suspected on the left. 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Similar to somewhat improved central opacities suggestive of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. 
2.  Decreased pleural effusions."

COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph [**2164-6-15**]. 
FINDINGS:  There is continued opacification of the right base.  It is not significantly worsened since the prior exam.  This may be due to a combination of pleural effusion, atelectasis, and aspiration.  In the proper clinical setting, pneumonia cannot be excluded.  There is a stable moderate right pleural effusion.  There is a small left pleural effusion.  No new consolidation is identified.  There is no pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  An esophageal stent is unchanged in position.  A drain is present overlying the mid abdomen.

TECHNIQUE:  Axially acquired images were obtained through the cervical spine without contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were also displayed. 
FINDINGS:  No fracture is identified.  Alignment is maintained.  Apparent mild thickening of the prevertebral soft tissues is likely due to intubation and NG tube placement.  Visualized soft tissues of the neck are within normal limits. CT does not provide intrathecal detail comparable that of MRI.  Lung apices demonstrate emphysema. 
Degenerative changes are noted throughout the cervical spine with moderate anterior osteophytes and calcification of the anterior longitudinal ligament. Small posterior osteophytes are noted at C4-5 and cause mild canal narrowing. 
IMPRESSION:  No fracture.  Alignment maintained.  Degenerative changes as described above."

The second feeding tube is off the lower portion of the radiograph likely resides within the stomach. There is a left sided chest tube unchanged. No pneumothorax is seen. There are old healed right rib fractures. There has been interval worsening of consolidation of the left lower lung with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm consistent with atelectasis vs. consolidation. No congestive heart failure is seen. 
IMPRESSION: 1) High ETT. 2) Interval left basilar opacification likely represents area of atelectasis vs. pneumonia."
"PORTABLE CHEST ON [**2161-3-14**] AT 06:03 
INDICATION:  Episode of flash pulmonary edema.  Dyspnea.  Check for change. 
COMPARISON:  [**2161-3-13**]. 
FINDINGS:  Compared to the prior study there is continued evidence of interstitial edema, now with a left pleural fluid and a poorly visualized left heart border.  Retrocardiac density could be atelectasis but pneumonia cannot be excluded.  There is slightly better aeration at the right lung base. 
PTX and features suggesting prior vertebroplasty at the L1 level. 
IMPRESSION: 
Mixed response with better aeration of the right lung and worsening opacity in the retrocardiac location.  Continued evidence of interstitial edema, no worse versus prior."

Two views.  Comparison with the previous study done [**2141-12-23**].  The patient is status post median sternotomy and [**Month/Day/Year 945**] as before.  There is increased density at the left base consistent with atelectasis or consolidation unchanged. Streaky density in the lower right lung is consistent with subsegmental atelectasis as well.  The costophrenic sulci now appear blunted.  Mediastinal structures are unchanged.  A carotid sheath has been withdrawn.  A PICC line remains in place. 
IMPRESSION:  Blunting of the costophrenic sulci consistent with small pleural effusions which may have increased or redistributed since the prior examination.  No other significant change."
"INDICATION:  CHF status post MI.  Acute respiratory failure.  ?CHF or pneumonia. 
Single portable AP view of the chest is compared with twelve hours ago. 
FINDINGS:  Again, the heart is markedly enlarged, and may even be slightly enlarged compared to the prior study. There is increased density of the retrocardiac region. There is no pneumothorax and no definite pleural effusion. The Swan- Ganz catheter and IABP have been removed. Osseous structures are unchanged. There are sternotomy wires present as well as mediastinal clips suggestive of prior CABG. 
IMPRESSION:  Marked cardiomegaly. Retrocardiac density may represent consolidation or collapse. Lateral view of the chest would be useful for futher evaluation when the patient is clinically stable."
"INDICATION:  53-year-old man with shortness of breath, rule out CHF, pneumonia. 
COMPARISON:  [**2185-1-14**]. 
BEDSIDE UPRIGHT VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Extremely limited radiograph due to underpenetration and extensive soft-tissue scatter.  The hemidiaphragms and part of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is excluded from the field-of-view. There is bilateral hazy interstitial opacity, with prominence of the apical pulmonary vasculature, suggesting mild pulmonary edema.  Stable moderate cardiomegaly is again noted.  The right lower lobe is not well visualized; however, there is more confluent opacity at the right lower lobe and pneumonia cannot be excluded. 
IMPRESSION:  Extremely limited radiograph.  Within these limitations, there is suggestion of mild pulmonary edema and confluent opacity in the right lower lobe and pneumonia cannot be excluded.                                                                       DFDdp"
"INDICATION:  Chest trauma.  Chest tube placement. 
PORTABLE AP SEMIUPRIGHT CHEST:  Compared to the exam performed 7 hours previously, there has been interval placement of a right-sided chest tube. The right hemidiaphragm is better visualized indicating in previously noted pleural effusion.  ET tube and left subclavian line remain in good position. The heart is slightly enlarged.  There is persistent left lower lobe atelectasis, which appears increase in the interval.  This may, therefore, represent left-sided effusion or increasing consolidation.  Right rib fracture is again noted. 
IMPRESSION:  Right-sided chest tube in good position, with interval decrease in size of right pleural effusion. 
Increasing left lower lobe opacity may indicate evolving consolidation with effusion."
"INDICATION:  Unresponsive, elevated INR. 
COMPARISON:  None available. 
TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT. 
There is no evidence of infarction, hemorrhage, loss of [**Doctor Last Name 34**]-white matter junction differentiation, mass effect, or edema.  The ventricles, sulci, and cisterns are of normal configuration and size of age.  Basal cisterns are preserved. No fractures are identified.  Mastoid air cells are partly opacified. There is no bony erosion.  Mastoid air cells are clear. 
IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial process.  Partial opacification of the mastoid air cells may be chronic, but this is of unclear time line given lack of priors.  Correlate clinically. 
PFI:  No acute intracranial hemorrhage.  MR is more sensitive in the detection of acute stroke."
"VENOUS DUPLEX UNILATERAL EXTREMITY MAPING: 
REASON:  Patient in need of lower extremity bypass graft.  Evaluate for superficial conduit. 
FINDINGS:  Grayscale evaluation is performed of both lower extremities.

IMPRESSION: 1.  Significant pooling in the valleculae for solid, nectar and honey consistencies. 2.  Laryngeal penetration was noted for nectar and honey consistencies. 3.  Frank tracheal aspiration was noted for nectar consistencies. 
Please see speech and swallow team report in OMR for further details."
"CHEST 
HISTORY:  Status post craniotomy, copious secretions. 
One portable AP view.  Comparison with [**2115-12-26**].  The patient is rotated to the left, but there still appears to be some volume loss in the left chest. There is probably interval increase in pleural fluid as well.  Mediastinal structures appear shifted to the left.  The left chest is nearly opacified and the cardiac silhouette essentially obliterated.  The right lung appears hyperexpanded and clear.  An endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube have been withdrawn. 
IMPRESSION:  Volume loss in the left lung and interval increase in pleural fluid on the left with near-opacification of the left chest post extubation."
"INDICATION:  30-year-old woman with MRSA endocarditis and multifocal pneumonia with loculated pleural effusions, now with chest tube, assess for pneumonia/effusions. 
COMPARISON:  [**2116-7-31**]. 
FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs are obtained.  Pigtail chest tube projects over the posterior left base and is unchanged.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Again, multiple round focal densities are noted bilaterally, representing known septic emboli.  Bilateral pleural effusions with possible loculated effusions in the fissures as before. Possible small left apical pneumothorax is unchanged. 
IMPRESSION:  No significant changes compared to the prior radiograph."
"HISTORY:  Outside PICC placement, please evaluate for proper placement before use. 
FINDINGS:  There is a right hydropneumothorax.  There is a small left pleural effusion.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  A right PICC line appears  malpositioned, with the tip projecting over the subclavian vein at the lateral upper chest.  The osseous structures are intact. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Interval development of large right hydropneumothorax. 2.  Malpositioned right PICC tip projects over the subclavian vein at the upper lateral right chest.  Repositioning is recommended. 3.  Findings discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 334**] at the time of interpretation."
"TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view. 
INDICATION:  67-year-old female patient status post transplant, with pneumothorax and chest tube, assess pneumothorax size. 
FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained 10 hours earlier during the same day.  Indwelling double-lumen dialysis catheter, right-sided chest tube and NG tube as before. Similar position of right internal jugular approach central venous line.  The right-sided chest tube remains in place and no pneumothorax can be identified presently.  No new parenchymal infiltrates are present.  Position of overlying drainage tubes in upper abdomen are unchanged.  Degree of vascular congestion is also unchanged. 
IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings during latest 10-hour examination interval."
"PORTABLE CHEST, [**2130-4-14**] and is compared to [**2130-4-13**]. 
INDICATION:  Subclavian catheter placement attempt. 
There has been interval removal of a left subclavian central venous catheter and right external jugular vein catheter.  No new catheter is seen on either side.  No pneumothorax is identified.  An ET tube remains in place, currently terminating 8 cm above carina.  An NG tube is in satisfactory position.  There are minimal atelectatic changes in the lower lobes with crowding of vessels. 
No confluent areas of consolidation are seen and no pleural effusions are identified. 
IMPRESSION: 1)  S/P catheter removal, with no evidence of pneumothorax. 
2)  Proximal position of ET tube, 8 cm above the carina."
"INDICATION:  S/P OG tube placement.  Check position. 
Comparison is made to the prior exam on the same day at 11:26 hours. 
FINDINGS:  A Swan-Ganz catheter and ET tube are in unchanged position.  An NG tube is seen coursing through the stomach and exits the field of view.  The heart is enlarged but stable in size.  The pulmonary vasculature is engorged with perihilar haze, consistent with cardiac failure.  Left-sided retrocardiac opacity and obscuration of the hemidiaphragm was consistent with atelectasis. 
IMPRESSION:  1)  NG tube seen coursing through stomach but exits the field of view. 
2)  Persistent cardiac failure and left basilar atelectasis."
"PORTABLE CHEST: 
INDICATION: Motor vehicle accident. 
Comparison is made to previous chest radiograph of 1 day earlier. 
An ETT, NG tube, and left subclavian vascular catheter remain in satisfactory position. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits allowing for leftward patient rotation. There remains dense left retrocardiac opacity which has progressed in the interval with associated further obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm. There is also a persistent small left pleural effusion. There is vascular engorgement and perihilar haziness noted. 
Note is made of a fracture involving the distal right clavicle. There are bilateral rib fractures. 
IMPRESSION: 
Progressive retrocardiac opacity, most likely due to atelectasis. A component of pulmonary contusion is also possible given rib fractures in this area. 
Persistent small left pleural effusion. 
Mild fluid overload. 
Multiple bilateral rib fractures and distal right clavicle fracture."
"HISTORY:  Trauma. 
COMPARISON:  No previous imaging of the chest is available for comparison. 
FINDINGS: 
Portable upright radiograph demonstrates a stellate opacity in the left upper lobe that tracks from the superior hilum towards the left pleura.  There is mild biapical pleural thickening which may be post-inflammatory.  Mild superior retraction of both hila is seen.  There is no pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  There is no pleural fluid.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  No rib fractures are seen. 
IMPRESSION: 
Stellate opacity in the left upper lobe is likely due to scarring, but comparison to previous radiographs, and if not available, frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest would be helpful. 
Findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7**] on [**2148-4-13**]."
"INDICATION:  84-year-old woman with increasing cough.  Evaluate for infiltrate. 
COMPARISONS:  Multiple priors, most recent PA and lateral chest radiograph [**2190-1-3**]. 
TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph. 
FINDINGS:  Left-sided single-chamber pacemaker is present with lead terminating in the right ventricle.  The cardiac silhouette is normal and unchanged from [**2190-1-3**].  There are increased interstitial markings bilaterally which appear slightly improved since [**2190-1-3**], consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure or chronic lung disease. Hyperexpansion of the lungs are noted which may reflect chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Trace left-sided pleural effusion is noted. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Mild interstitial prominence consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure or chronic lung disease, mildly improved since [**2190-1-3**]. 2.  Trace left-sided pleural effusion."
"INDICATION:  Status post AVR, assess left lung opacity. 
TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest. 
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from [**2143-11-26**]. 
FINDINGS:  Rounded bilateral mid lung opacities are again seen, grossly unchanged and likely reflect consolidative infectious process given history of septic emboli.  There is unchanged bibasilar opacification, which is likely atelectasis with left greater than right effusions.  Cardiac silhouette is markedly enlarged, similar to the most recent prior.  Left PICC terminates in the cavoatrial junction.  Median sternotomy wires are intact. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Unchanged bilateral mid lung opacities likely reflect infectious process given history of septic emboli. 2.  Unchanged or slightly increased left greater than right pleural effusion and associated atelectasis."
"REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Current wound infection, elevated sputum production. 
Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**2157-7-1**]. 
The tracheostomy tip is 6.5 cm above the carina.  The right subclavian line tip, the pacemaker leads, and the direction of the feeding tube are in standard positions. 
The heart is moderately enlarged but stable.  The bilateral pleural effusion, right larger than left are unchanged with most probably large mediastinal pleural component on the right.  The moderate pulmonary edema is also unchanged.  Mediastinal widening seen on the last two chest x-rays in comparison to [**6-29**] is most probably due to a enlarged mediastinal veins accompaning pulmonary edema. 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Unchanged bilateral moderate pleural effusion and pulmonary edema. 
2.  Slightly widened mediastinum most probably due to enlarged pulmonary veins."
"EXAMINATION:  Portable abdomen. 
INDICATION:  Abdominal distension. 
Limited evaluation of the abdomen on two images shows distension of a loop of bowel presumably transverse colon up to approximately 9 cm.  Contrast is seen in the right side of the colon.  No contrast is seen in the distal colon. Scattered air is seen in non-distended small bowel and also in the stomach. No radiopaque foreign material is seen.  Diffuse haziness is present, which may be secondary to body habitus, but ascites would also be a possibility. 
IMPRESSION: 
Minimal distension of transverse colon.  No air distal to this.  The findings likely represent an ileus type of pattern.  However if obstruction is a strong suspicion, clinically obtain CT."
"CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST 
INDICATION:  40-year-old male presenting with multiple foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
COMPARISONS:  CT [**2153-6-17**]. 
TECHNIQUE:  Axial contiguous 5 mm images of the brain were acquired. 
FINDINGS:  Multiple foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the left frontal, right temporal, and right occipital lobes are unchanged compared to the examination from 24 hours prior.  A small hyperdense focus in the left subdural area overlying the left frontal lobe is stable as well.  There is no hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures. There is no evidence of new hemorrhage. 
IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of scattered foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage and probable left subdural clot compared to examination 24 hours prior."
"CHEST, 2 VIEWS, PA AND LATERAL: 
Preop carotid stenosis. 
The heart size is normal.  No evidence for CHF.  There is a focal area of pleural density in the left mid zone acute or chronic nature of which is uncertain in the absence of prior films for comparison.  No definite associated rib lesion.  There is probable biapical scarring.  No free pleural effusion.  Surgical clips are present in the right neck. 
IMPRESSION:  Focal area of pleural density in left mid zone, as described. Significance and acute/chronic nature undetermined in the absence of prior films.  Comparison with prior outside films if available would be helpful. Alternatively short term follow up after surgery is suggested to reevaluate and determine if there is a need for further workup such as CT scan."
"INDICATION:  Elevated LFTs and suspected stent failure. 
FINDINGS:  Fluoroscopic imaging performed during endoscopy by the Gastroenterology staff.  No radiologist was present during this examination. The initial scout radiograph showed biliary stent within the region of the common duct.  A suture was identified at the confluence of the common hepatic duct and the main right and left intrahepatic ducts.  Stents were placed across this region of strictured bile duct by report.  No evidence of leak or filling defect identified within the visualized extrahepatic biliary system. 
IMPRESSION:  Stricture in the region of the confluence of the common hepatic duct and central intrahepatic biliary system."
"HISTORY:  Status post PICC removal and placement of a Hickman catheter. Recheck Hickman placement. 
SINGLE VIEW CHEST:  Note this is a redictation of a film that was already reported on [**2148-7-15**].  Comparison is made to a previous exam of [**2148-7-8**]. 
There has been interval removal of a right sided PICC.  A tunneled right sided Hickman catheter is in place, with the tip overlying the proximal SVC. The patient's pacer leads remain in satisfactory position.  There is stable cardiomegaly. The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. The lung fields remain clear.  Note that the left lateral hemithorax is not included on this exam.  There is no evidence of a pneumothorax. 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Satisfactory placement of right sided Hickman catheter.  No evidence of pneumothorax."
"INDICATIONS:  Labored breathing. Endotracheal tube placement. 
Comparison is made to previous films from  one day earlier. 
An endotracheal tube has been placed, in satisfactory position.  A nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragms and the right PICC line remains in place. The examination of the cardiovascular status of the patient is limited due to low lung volumes and respiratory motion. With this limitation in mind there is no gross evidence of pulmonary edema.  Left retrocardiac opacity persists, unchanged.  Again demonstrated are somewhat distended loops of bowel within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen. 
IMPRESSION:   Endotracheal tube in satisfactory position. Otherwise no significant change allowing for differences in technique between the two studies."
"INDICATION:  Status post renal transplant with increasing fluid via the JP drain.  Evaluate for hydronephrosis. 
COMPARISON:  None. 
TECHNIQUE:  Transplant renal ultrasound. 
FINDINGS:  The transplant kidney located in the right lower quadrant measures 12.2 cm.  There is no hydronephrosis.  The corticomedullary differentiation is preserved.  There is a trace amount of fluid about the transplant kidney. There is normal color flow within the transplant renal artery and vein, and normal waveforms within the transplant arteries, with resistive indices ranging from 0.65-0.77.  The bladder contains a catheter consistent with a transplant ureteral stent.  There is a tiny amount of fluid within the left lower quadrant. 
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of large perinephric fluid collection.  Normal postoperative appearance of the transplant kidney, with resistive indices ranging from 0.65-0.77."
"CHEST X-RAY. 
CLINICAL INDICATION:  Assess for worsening pulmonary edema. 
FINDINGS:  A single portable image of the chest is compared to the prior examination dated [**2177-8-22**].  There is minimal interval enlargement of the right pleural effusion noted on the prior examination.  Otherwise, no significant interval change.  A left pleural effusion persists.  There is stable perihilar fullness associated with loss of definition of pulmonary bronchovasculature consistent with underlying edema.  There is a stable right IJ line with its tip within the expected region of the superior vena cava. The cardiac silhouette is grossly unchanged. 
IMPRESSION:  Minimal interval enlargement of right pleural effusion. Otherwise, stable examination as described above."
"CLINICAL INDICATION:  67-year-old male with history of hemoptysis, now with acute onset severe right upper quadrant pain.  Evaluate for cause of right upper quadrant pain. 
TECHNIQUE:  Two AP radiographs of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained with the patient in the supine and upright positions. 
FINDINGS:  There is a normal bowel gas pattern without dilation or air-fluid levels.  Stool is seen throughout the colon.  There is no free air. 
There is severe degenerative disease in the lower lumbar spine.  Surgical clips are seen in the pelvis and are likely related to prior prostatectomy.

COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs of [**2112-11-15**], [**2112-11-11**].  Chest CT of [**2112-11-15**]. 
FINDINGS:  Frontal view of the chest was obtained.  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Since the previous study of [**2112-11-15**], there has been slight improvement of a diffuse interstitial pulmonary process, affecting the right lung more than the left.  Cardiogenic pulmonary edema superimposed on emphysema would be most compatible with the asymmetric interstitial pulmonary process seen, but differential diagnosis includes hemorrhage, infection, and aspiration.    No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mediastinal vascular congestion remains. 
IMPRESSION:  Slight interval improvement of diffuse interstitial pulmonary process, most compatible with cardiogenic pulmonary edema, but cannot exclude differential as listed above."
"INDICATION:  Status post gastric bypass, bleed at anastomosis. 
COMPARISONS:  None. 
SINGLE VIEW CHEST, PORTABLE SUPINE:  The left costophrenic angle has been clipped from the film.  The ET tube is in appropriate position at the thoracic inlet.  The NG tube courses below the diaphragm into the stomach.  Surgical clips are seen at the upper abdomen.  The film is limited by patient motion. Allowing for this, the pulmonary vasculature appears within normal limits, and there are no focal pulmonary opacities.  Widening of the mediastinum may be due to technique or patient body habitus. 
IMPRESSION:  No radiographic appearance of pneumonia or CHF.

"PROCEDURE:  VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW 
INDICATION:  75 year old female with cough and decreased sats when eating. 
FINDINGS:  The radiologist was present to provide the speech pathologist with assistance during video oropharyngeal swallow examination. Video imaging was performed during swallowing to evaluate solid and liquid consistencies. 
There is mild loss of bolus control with premature spillover and intermittent penetration during swallowing of nectars. However, in this instance, there is spontaneous cough with clearing. With thin liquids, aspiration is seen and spontaneous cough is ineffective at clearing material. Cued cough improves clearing of material. Aspiration is due to mild reduced laryngeal elevation as well as reduced valve closure. Swallowing to puree consistences was unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION:  Aspiration to thin liquids with ineffective spontaneous cough secondary to mild reduced laryngeal elevation and valve closure. Please see the speech pathologist report for recommendations and further details."
"INDICATION:  46-year-old male found unresponsive.  Rule out fracture. 
COMPARISONS:  No comparisons are available. 
RIGHT TIB/FIB, TWO VIEWS:  There is a fracture of the distal tib/fib with evidence of healing.  There is posterior angulation of the distal fragments over the proximal fragments. There is persistence of lucent area through the callus. Correlation with clinical history is recommended.  It could represent a bad healing from an old fracture or a new fracture. 
There are multiple screws in the distal tibia and fibula beyond the previously described fracture. There is a side plate and screws in the distal fibula. 
There is another subacute fracture of the proximal fibula with callus formation around it. 
IMPRESSION: Lucency through subacute/chronic fracuture of the distal tibia and fibula. It is unclear whether this represents incomplete healing or if it is a new fracture. Clinical correlation recommended."

COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies between [**2164-3-31**], and [**2158-5-8**]. 
INDICATION:  Collapsed left lung. 
Left hemithorax remains completely opacified.  Mediastinal shift is difficult to evaluate due to marked patient rotation towards the left.  Right-sided vascular structures appear indistinct, likely due to a combination of motion artifact and mild interstitial edema.  Small right pleural effusion is again demonstrated. 
IMPRESSION:  Persistent opacification of left hemithorax, likely due to a combination of left lung collapse and pleural effusion.  Given abrupt termination of distal left bronchus, bronchoscopy may be helpful to clear impacted secretions."
"HISTORY:  Jaundice and choledocholithiasis. 
TECHNIQUE:  ERCP. 
FINDINGS:  14 fluoroscopic spot images acquired during an ERCP procedure are submitted for review. 
There is mild dilatation of intrahepatic biliary ducts with minimal irregularity along the wall of the ducts, likely related to inflammation. Abrupt termination of the duct was seen at the ampulla. 
By ERCP report, a sphincterectomy was performed and stones and sludge were noted in the common bile duct.  The stones were extracted from the bile duct successfully.  A biliary stent was placed, due to suspicion for cholangitis. 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Mild intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation. 
2.  Biliary sphincterectomy with stones extraction and biliary stent placement. 
3.  Abrupt tapering of the dilated common duct at the ampulla--unclear if this is inflammatory or due to mass.

Mild pulmonary edema has worsened since earlier in the day.  Small region of consolidation at the right lung base which developed between [**5-14**] and [**5-19**] is possible pneumonia.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Small pleural effusions are presumed, right greater than left.  No pneumothorax.  ET tube, dual-channel right supraclavicular central venous line, and a Swan-Ganz catheter are in standard placements.  Nasogastric tube is looped in the stomach and a small bore catheter also projects over the upper stomach, possible percutaneous gastrostomy, or drain."
"INDICATION: Vascular congestion post total pneumonectomy of the left. 
Comparison is made to [**2110-5-25**] at 1024. 
FINDINGS: A tracheostomy tube is unchanged in position. There is stable leftward shift of the mediastinum and fluid within the left pneumonectomy cavity. A surgical drain and surgical skin staples are seen overlying the left hemithorax. Fluid is seen within the minor fissure and also tracking laterally and superiorly along the right chest wall. There remain patchy air space opacifications within the right lung, which have been attributed to pneumonia. A left sided IJ central line is unchanged in position. There are new areas of focal consolidation. No new pneumothorax is seen on the right. 
IMPRESSION: 1. Slight increase in size of right sided pleural effusion. 2. Unchanged appearance of right lung pneumonia."
"HISTORY:  Open AAA repair with pulmonary edema. 
CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. 
Right IJ central line is present, tip over proximalmost SVC. 
Status post sternotomy.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged compared with one day earlier.  There is a moderately large left effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  Probably also a small-to-moderate right effusion, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF.  No pneumothorax is detected.

"PORTABLE CHEST, [**2130-10-6**]: 
HISTORY:  Intubation, query pneumothorax. 
Comparison to prior study from [**2130-10-2**]. 
PORTABLE CHEST:  The ETT is in satisfactory position, approximately 4 cm above the carina.  There is relative lucency at the left apex adjacent to an interface, though no visceral pleural line is identified.  Minimal linear atelectasis is seen at the left base.  Otherwise the lungs are clear and there are no effusions.  The heart size and mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. 
IMPRESSION: 1)  Satisfactory position of ETT. 2)  Unusual interface with peripheral relative lucency at the left apex.  This may represent a skin fold rather than a pneumothorax, as there is no visceral pleural line as would be expected with a pneumothorax.  However, given clinical concern for pneumothorax, a repeat study is warranted."

"AP CHEST 6:05 A.M. ON [**11-2**] 
HISTORY:  Pancreatitis, pleural effusion, desaturation. 
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to chest radiographs since [**10-29**], most recently [**11-2**] at 1:20 a.m.  Lung volumes have improved and pleural effusions have largely resolved.  Focal consolidation in the right lower lung is concerning for pneumonia, whereas left perihilar opacification could be atelectasis or mild edema.  Both bear watching. 
The tip of the endotracheal tube at the upper margin of the clavicles, 6.5 cm from the carina, is 2 cm above optimal placement.  Nasogastric tube passes through the mid stomach and out of view.

IMPRESSION: Decreased left pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis. No pneumothorax."
"HISTORY:  Rule out subluxation. 
SINGLE LATERAL VIEW OF THE CERVICAL SPINE, SWIMMER'S VIEW: 
The humerus obscures much of the posterior elements.  Allowing for this, the patient is status post vertebrectomy of C5.  Alignment is preserved at the C1- C5 levels.  It is difficult to confirm alignment at the C5-6 levels, but no obvious subluxation is identified.  The prevertebral soft tissues are prominent, as noted on earlier examinations.  An electrode (? temperature probe) overlies the lower prevertebral soft tissues though its exact positioning is uncertain. 
IMPRESSION:  Anatomic alignment from C1-C5.  Alignment between C5 and C6 is not optimally demonstrated due to overlying soft tissues, but no obvious subluxation is seen.  Alignment between C7 and T1 is within normal limits."
"PORTABLE CHEST, [**2161-1-22**]:

Given for slight differences in film technique, there is grossly unchanged appearance to moderate-to-large right-sided pleural effusion with loculated fissural component and left-sided pleural effusion and basilar atelectasis. Retrocardiac opacity remains grossly stable, likely representing atelectasis, however, underlying consolidative process cannot be excluded.  A malpositioned right-sided central venous catheter has been removed on current radiograph. Calcification within the thoracic aorta and scoliotic changes of the thoracolumbar spine are unchanged. 
IMPRESSION:  Overall, stable appearance of moderate-to-large right-sided pleural effusion, including loculated component and left-sided pleural effusion and atelectasis.  Underlying consolidative process cannot be completely excluded."

FINDINGS:  The right internal jugular central venous catheter is in satisfactory position with the distal tip projected over the expected location of the upper SVC.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Left lower lobe atelectasis is moderately severe.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.  A nasogastric tube is satisfactorily placed with the side hole well below the expected location of the gastroesophageal junction.  A well-circumscribed lucency likely in the left subphrenic space may be extraluminal, abdominal surgical clips suggest recent laparotomy. 
IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory position of right internal jugular central venous catheter.

"CHEST RADIOGRAPH 
TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable view of radiograph was compared with prior radiographs through [**2142-10-4**] with the most recent from [**2142-10-7**]. 
FINDINGS: 
Since [**2142-10-7**], there is large pleural effusion causing near complete opacification of right hemithorax and mediastinal shift to the right side. Because of the obscuration of the left mediastinal and cardiac borders, evaluation of the cardiomediastinal silhouette was limited.  Right lung volume is low.  Mild-to-moderate amount of atelectasis is present at lung base and pleural effusion, if any, is mild. 
IMPRESSION: Large right pleural effusion increased since [**2142-10-7**] with mediastinal shift to the right side.

Right chest tube remains in place in the lower right hemithorax with persistent basilar hydropneumothorax, not substantially changed.  Previously reported apical hydropneumothorax is less well visualized but may be due to lack of fully upright positioning.  Diffuse interstitial pattern in the right lung is again demonstrated with associated diffuse hazy opacities, not substantially changed.  Minimal patchy opacity has developed in the left retrocardiac region, likely atelectasis.  Subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall is without change.

"CHEST PA AND LATERAL 
INDICATION:  A 53-year-old man treated for pneumonia, history of end-stage lung disease, rising white blood cell count, eval for infiltrate or edema. 
COMPARISON:  [**2176-12-24**]. 
FINDINGS:  Left central venous catheter has been removed.  Multifocal bilateral opacities, some cavitated, are decreasing in size. The small right pleural effusion is unchanged. The effusion is likely secondary to hepatic disease given its stability in the midst of improving pneumonia.  The heart is normal size and mediastinal contours are normal.  There is no pulmonary edema. 
IMPRESSION:  Improving multifocal pulmonary infection though etiology (airway versus hematologic dissemination) is radiographically indeterminate."
"CLINICAL INDICATION:  80 year old male with acute chest pain and dyspnea. 
TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest. 
COMPARISON:  [**2123-4-27**]. 
FINDINGS:  The left subclavian catheter remains in stable position at the junction of the brachiocephalic vein and SVC.  There is stable cardiac enlargement with a left ventricular pattern.

"Portable chest of [**3-27**] compared to [**3-24**]. 
INDICATION:  Worsening productive cough. 
The cardiac silhouette and mediastinal contours are stable.  Marked tortuosity of the thoracic aorta and this likely is accentuated by patient rotation.  There has been interval worsening of the left retrocardiac opacity. There is slight blunting of both costophrenic angles.  Note is also made of peripheral asymmetrical opacity in the right apex as well as a linear band like opacity in the right upper lobe at slightly lower level.  These findings are unchanged. 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Worsening left retrocardiac opacity which may be related to atelectasis, infarction, or pneumonia. 
2.  Nonspecific peripheral right upper lobe opacity, possibly due to scarring. Cmpoarison to older radiographs would be helpful to document a stable appearance."
"INDICATION:  Status post Bentall, evaluate for effusion.

HISTORY:  Ileus or obstruction.  Tachycardia and tachypnea. 
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**12-24**] through 7: 
Pulmonary edema present on [**12-26**] has largely cleared.  Given the exceedingly low lung volumes, bibasilar consolidation should be due to atelectasis, but I cannot exclude pneumonia.  The upper lungs are clear. Pleural effusion is minimal, if any.  There is no pneumothorax.  A right PIC line ends in the upper right atrium.  Heart is not particularly enlarged, though difficult to assess because of very small chest due to marked intestinal distention in the imaged portion of the upper abdomen.  No definite pneumoperitoneum.  Nasogastric tube ends in a moderately distended stomach."
"INDICATIONS:    HIV, SOB, fever, O2 saturation 66%.  Worsening hypoxia. Evaluate for change in endotracheal tube and infiltrates. 
FINDINGS:   Single AP supine view.  Comparison is made to previous films from [**2177-10-5**].  There is evidence of diffuse increased consolidation throughout both lungs consistent with worsening pulmonary edema, diffuse pulmonary infection or ARDS.  The cardiac silhouete is largely obscured. The heart does not appear to have increased in size. The changes are most severe in the left lung, particularly in the lower zones. 
The endotracheal tube and the right IJ central line remain in excellent positions. 
IMPRESSION:   Marked increase in intensity of diffuse bilateral pulmonary consolidations."
"INDICATION:  Chest pain. 
COMPARISON:  [**2194-2-28**]. 
PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Study is limited due to patient rotation. The heart size remains top normal in size.  The aorta demonstrates diffuse calcifications.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly likely unchanged. The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  There appears to be bronchial wall thickening noted in the left mid lung field.  Lungs remain hyperinflated, compatible with underlying COPD.  Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.  No focal consolidation is visualized.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures is present with a mild wedge compression deformity of a mid thoracic vertebral body, unchanged, and old left rib cage deformities. 
IMPRESSION:  COPD with bronchial wall thickening in the left mid lung field suggestive of bronchitis.  Bibasilar atelectasis.                                                                       DFDdp"

Since the prior study there has been interval development of scoliosis of the lumbar spine with convexity to the left.  There is a 17 mm curvilinear calcification noted to the left of the L3-4 disc space.  Most likely this represents an osteophyte.  There is no subdiaphragmatic free air.  There is a relative paucity of air within the colon.  However air is seen in the rectum and in several loops of small bowel.  No abnormal calcifications to suggest kidney stones are seen. 
IMPRESSION:  Nonspecific bowel gas pattern."
"INDICATION:  Trauma with hypoxia and tachycardia. 
FINDINGS: 
Comparison is made to a prior study from the previous day. 
An endotracheal tube terminates at the thoracic inlet.  The heart is enlarged but unchanged in size.  The mediastinal contours are stable.  There is a probable small left-sided pleural effusion.  A small amount of patchy basilar opacity is seen on the right and in the retrocardiac region, which could represent atelectasis, aspiration, or early pneumonia.  No pneumothorax or failure are seen. 
IMPRESSION: 
No evidence of failure.  Patchy right basilar and left retrocardiac opacity is seen that could represent atelectasis, aspiration, or early pneumonia."
"PROCEDURE:  Chest, portable AP on [**2170-12-28**].

INDICATION:  Aortic dissection.  Desaturation.  Evaluate effusion/infiltrates. 
FINDINGS:  Compared with 5/21 and [**2200-6-29**], tubes and lines are unchanged in positions.  No overt CHF. 
There is persistent patchy infiltrate at the right lung base.  There is a new focus of patchy infiltrate in the right mid lung field laterally and a small- to-mild right pleural effusion. 
General haziness of the left hemithorax has not dramatically changed, consistent with a layering effusion.  A loculated component at the left apex appears perhaps slightly smaller.  The widening of the aortic arch contour appears grossly stable. 
IMPRESSION:  New right mid lung infiltrate/aspiration.  Small right pleural effusion. 
Otherwise, no dramatic changes. 
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4519**] [**Doctor Last Name 1072**] was paged for these findings."
"INDICATION:  Status post PEG tube placement, with free air under the diaphragm and fever.  Please evaluate placement of PEG tube. 
COMPARISON:  None. 
TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS:  With the patient in a left lateral decubitus position, approximately 100 mL of water-soluble contrast material was instilled through the gastrostomy tube into the stomach, without evidence of an extraluminal leak.  The patient was then placed in a supine position, further demonstrating normal filling of the stomach.  There was delayed gastric emptying, not fully assessed on this study.

"INDICATION:  86-year-old male with weakness.  Evaluate for bleed. 
COMPARISON:  [**2110-7-17**]. 
TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained through the brain.  No contrast was administered. 
FINDINGS:  There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, major vascular territorial infarction, mass effect, or edema.  [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation is preserved.  Scattered periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensity is likely related to chronic small vessel ischemic disease. Age-appropriate prominence of ventricles and sulci is consistent with a moderate degree of diffuse parenchymal volume loss.  The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.  Globes and lenses are intact. No osseous abnormality is identified. 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  No acute intracranial abnormality.

PORTABLE SUPINE AND UPRIGHT ABDOMEN:  There are no dilated loops of small or large bowel, without evidence of obstruction or ileus.  There is no evidence for free intraperitoneal air or pneumatosis.  Multiple surgical clips overlie the right upper and left upper quadrants of the abdomen.  Vascular calcifications are seen within the pelvis.  In addition, a rounded calcific focus in the left mid abdomen, measuring approximately 6 mm, likely reflects calcification within the pancreas as seen on CT abdomen and pelvis. Osseous structures reveal a diffusely mottled appearance, with a ""rugger jersey"" spine, compatible with changes from renal osteodystrophy. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  No obstruction or ileus. 
2.  Osseous changes of renal osteodystrophy."
"INDICATION:  Dysphagia, failed bedside evaluation. 
VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW:  The study was conducted in collaboration with speech pathology.  Various consistencies of barium were administered by mouth including nectar, honey, and puree.

COMPARISON:  [**2139-7-12**]. 
SINGLE VIEW CHEST:  A right Swan-Ganz catheter has been placed which terminates in the right main pulmonary artery.  The left subclavian catheter terminates in the upper SVC.  The NG tube and feeding tube both extend into the stomach.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  The appearance of bilateral ill-defined pulmonary infiltrates appear slightly worse in the interval and may be consistent with multifocal infection.  No pleural effusions are identified.  The patient is status post CABG. 
IMPRESSION: 1)  Appropriate positioning of pulmonary artery catheter without evidence for pneumothorax. 2)  Slight interval progression in the appearance of bilateral ill-defined pulmonary infiltrates which may be consistent with infection."
"CLINICAL HISTORY:  CABG x4, now with acute desaturations status post removal of chest  tubes. 
CHEST:  The left chest tube has been removed.  No pneumothorax is seen. Infiltrates are present in the right side particularly in the right upper lobe slightly more pronounced on the previous chest x-ray though this is probably exaggerated due to the low lung volumes.  Increased density behind the heart is also present suggesting infiltrates or atelectasis in the left lower lobe as well.

"AP CHEST 5:49 A.M. [**3-13**] 
HISTORY:  Esophagectomy. 
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**3-11**] and 7: 
Bibasilar atelectasis, moderate on the right and severe on the left has worsened.  No endotracheal tube is seen below C7, the upper margin of this film.  Mediastinum from the level of the carina to the thoracic inlet has widened.  This could be due to a combination of venous engorgement and some distention of the conduit.  This needs to be followed closely to exclude hemorrhage.  Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion is stable.  Heart is not enlarged.  Upper lungs are clear.  No pneumothorax. 
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 14819**], covering for Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4009**], and I discussed these findings by telephone, at the time of dictation."
"STUDY:  ERCP. 
INDICATION:  32-year-old female presenting with elevated bilirubin, abnormal LFTs, and question of pancreatic cancer. 
COMPARISONS:  CT [**2152-12-28**]. 
[**Month/Day/Year 59024**]:  Eight fluoroscopic images obtained in the fluoroscopic suite without the presence of a radiologist are submitted for review.  These images demonstrate cannulation of the common bile duct and subsequent opacification of the biliary tree with contrast.  An area of narrowing is noted within the distal common bile duct.  The proximal CBD and intrahepatic biliary ducts appear within normal limits without areas of focal stenosis or dilatation. Subsequent images demonstrate the deployment of a metal stent within the mid-to-lower portion of the CBD.

"PORTABLE CHEST, [**2121-12-26**]. 
INDICATION:  Endotracheal tube assessment. 
Examination is technically limited due to exclusion of significant portion of the right mid and lower lung from the radiograph.  By report of the technologist, multiple attempts were made to repeat the chest radiograph, but the patient was not available. 
Endotracheal tube is in standard position terminating 4 cm above the carina. Right internal jugular vascular catheter likely terminates in the proximal right atrium and an ICD remains in standard position as well as a nasogastric tube.  Cardiomediastinal contours are without change, and previously reported interstitial edema has slightly worsened. 
IMPRESSION: Slight worsening interstitial edema."
"Infant on ventilator.  This examination is compared to [**2158-12-16**]. Endotracheal tube is at the thoracic inlet.  The nasogastric tube reaches the level of the stomach.  PDA clip is in place.  A bladder catheter is overlying the lower pelvis.  A right femoral PICC line terminates at the level of T10, likely at the IVC-RA junction region.  There is increasing air space opacity on the right which may represent asymmetric pulmonary edema.  The heart size is stable.  Multifocal areas of atelectasis, retrocardiac and at the right lung base medially.  Bowel gas pattern is unremarkable, liver may be mildly enlarged. 
IMPRESSION:  Asymmetric air space disease, right greater than left may represent asymmetric pulmonary edema.  Medial opacities, likely atelectasis at the right lung base."
"INDICATION:  Ischemic leg with shortness of breath. 
COMPARISON:  [**2140-8-11**]. 
FINDINGS:  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  The trachea and aortic knob are calcified.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Right middle lobe opacity is new in the interval and likely represents a combination of consolidation and possibly subpulmonic fluid.  Right lateral decubitus view would be helpful in further evaluation.  The left lung is clear.  No left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Right internal jugular central venous line has been removed in the interval.  Surgical clips are seen in the right axilla.  There is a new compression fracture of the lower thoracic spine. 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Right middle lobe consolidation with possible subpulmonic effusion.  Right lateral decubitus view is recommended for further evaluation. 
2.  New compression fracture of the lower thoracic spine."
"INDICATION:  64-year-old with hypotension, chest pain, syncope. 
PORTABLE SUPINE FRONTAL RADIOGRAPH. 
No prior studies. 
FINDINGS:  The patient is slightly rotated.  The heart is enlarged and mediastinal contours appear slightly widened.  There is diffuse pulmonary engorgement consistent with CHF.  There are likely small bilateral pleural effusions.  The patient is post-CABG and mediastinal clips are present as well as sternotomy wires.  An endotracheal tube terminates at the level of the clavicles.  No pneumothorax is seen on this supine radiograph. 
IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly and CHF.  Widened appearance of the mediastinum may be due to projection and technique, though an aortic injury cannot be excluded on this examination.  If there is clinical concern, a CT angiogram is recommended."

HISTORY:  Post AAA repair. 
COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated [**2150-1-15**]. 
FINDINGS:  Support tubes and lines remain stable.  The distal tip of the Swan- Ganz catheter remains in the undivided main pulmonary artery segment. There is diffuse hydrostatic edema again appreciated with continued engorgement of the vascular pedicle.  There are bilateral pleural effusions. Consolidation in the lower lobes is difficult to entirely exclude.  There is no pneumothorax. 
IMPRESSION:  Diffuse likely hydrostatic edema consistent with cardiac decompensation.  Bilateral pleural effusions are grossly stable.  Focal consolidation in the lower lobes is difficult to entirely exclude.  Repeat radiography following appropriate diuresis recommended to assess for underlying infection."
"HISTORY:  74-year-old woman, with subungual hematoma in the right hallux from trauma.  Please assess for acute fracture. 
RIGHT TOE RADIOGRAPH, THREE VIEWS:  The study is interpreted without prior comparison. 
There is severe diffuse osteopenia. No lucent or sclerotic fracture line and no dislocation is identified. A double cortical contour is noted along the medial aspect of the 1st proximal phalanx, but no associated fracture line is identified. 
There is hallux valgus configuration with 1st MTP degenerative changes. Faint soft tissue calcification is noted adjacent to the distal 1st metatarsal medially-- the etiology is uncertain.  There is no erosion to confirm the presence of gout. 
IMPRESSION: 
No acute fracture or dislocation detected. However, given the degree of osteopenia, if symptoms persist, repeat radiographs in [**5-31**] days may help for further assessment."

FINDINGS:  A single AP semi-upright image.  No comparison study.  The appearances of the heart, lungs, pleura and mediastinum are unremarkable.  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality is identified.  There is no evidence of cardiac failure.  No pneumonic consolidation is seen.  The left costophrenic angle is incompletely displayed.  There appears to be some widening of the superior mediastinum raising the question of a mass just above the thoracic inlet.  This could be a thyroid mass.  Evaluation of this region by CT should be considered when clinically appropriate. 
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Possible superior mediastinal mass questioned.  CT evaluation would be helpful when clinically appropriate."
"PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST, [**2116-5-23**] 
COMPARISON:  [**2116-5-23**] at 5:44 a.m. 
INDICATION:  Aspiration. 
An endotracheal tube terminates within 1 cm of the carina.  Other lines and tubes are unchanged and remain in standard position.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable.  An asymmetrical bilateral alveolar pattern is again demonstrated with relative sparing of the left lower lobe.  This is most likely due to asymmetrical pulmonary edema but superimposed process such as pneumonia is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. 
IMPRESSION:  Low position of endotracheal tube.  Findings communicated by telephone to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 19977**] on [**2116-5-23**]."
"INDICATION:  43 year old woman with DM and end-stage renal disease, and foot ulcers.  Right lower lobe pneumonia. 
COMMENT:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest is reviewed, and compared to previous study of yesterday. 
The previously-identified right lower lobe pneumonia has been slightly improving.  The previously-identified pulmonary edema has been slightly improving, also.  There is continued small bilateral pleural effusion. 
Again note is made of slight prominence of the upper mediastinum, which is unchanged.  No pneumothorax is identified. 
Again note is made of hip fracture in the lateral aspect of the right fifth rib. 
IMPRESSION: 
1) Improving right lower lobe pneumonia. 
2) Improving pulmonary edema.  Small bilateral pleural effusion."
"MRI OF THE BRAIN. 
CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient with lung cancer and pericardial effusion, rule out cranial mass. 
TECHNIQUE:  T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images were obtained before gadolinium.  T1 axial and coronal images were obtained following gadolinium.  There are no prior examinations for comparison. 
FINDINGS:  The ventricles and extra-axial spaces are normal in size.  There is no midline shift, mass effect, or hydrocephalus seen.  There are no focal signal abnormalities or territorial infarcts seen.  Following gadolinium, no abnormal enhancement is noted. 
IMPRESSION:  No significant abnormalities detected in the MRI of the brain with and without gadolinium."
"INDICATION:  Increased congestion right lung field evaluate for worsening CHF. 
PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST DATED [**2160-3-19**] IS COMPARED WITH THE AP CHEST DATED [**2160-3-18**]:  The patient is post-median sternotomy and CABG. There is a dual lead cardiac pacemaker and ICD.  There is a large right pleural effusion which is not significantly changed.  There is increased pulmonary vascular engorgement.  There is near complete opacitfication of the right lung.  An underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded. The osseous structures are unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION:  Stable large right pleural effusion.  CHF. Follow up studies should be performed to further evaluate the right lung parenchyma after resolution of the effusion."
"INDICATION:  Patient with pulmonary embolus, now with hypotension and altered mental status on Heparin.  Evaluate for hemorrhage. 
COMPARISON:  [**2106-3-29**]. 
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT SCAN:  There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or shift of the normally midline structures.  The ventricles and cisterns are normal.  There is hypodensity within the right frontal periventricular white matter, consistent with chronic microvascular ischemia. There may be a small lacunar infarction within the white matter adjacent to the right caudate head, also unchanged.  Otherwise, the density values of the brain parenchyma are normal, with preservation of the [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation.  The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage."
"CLINICAL INDICATION:  Line placement. 
A SG catheter is present, terminating in the region of the junction of the distal right pulmonary artery and interlobar pulmonary artery. 
Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable with mild cardiac enlargement. Pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits for semi-erect positioning of the patient.  There are bilateral pleural effusions present, which are likely unchanged, allowing for differences in patient positioning.  A prominent skin fold is noted in the left hemithorax, but there is no evidence of pneumothorax. 
IMPRESSION:  SG catheter in satisfactory position.  Persistent bilateral pleural effusions."
"PORTABLE CHEST:  Compared to 1 day earlier. 
CLINICAL INDICATION:  Respiratory difficulties following C-section.  Clinical diagnosis of pulmonary edema. 
An endotracheal tube and central venous catheter remain in satisfactory position.  The cardiac silhouette is slightly prominent but stable in size compared to the recent study.  The pulmonary vascularity appears less engorged and there has been interval slight decrease in the degree of perihilar haziness in the interval.  There is however an increasing confluent area of opacity in the left retrocardiac region. 
IMPRESSION: 
1)  Decreased perihilar haziness, likely due to improving pulmonary edema considering the provided clinical history. 
2)  Worsening confluent opacity in left retrocardiac region.  Differential diagnosis includes a resolving asymmetric area of dependent pulmonary edema, vs. an acute aspiration or atelectasis."
"PROCEDURE:  Chest portable AP view on [**2103-1-8**].

HISTORY:  79-year-old man with aspiration pneumonia, now intubated, evaluate for interval changes. 
FINDINGS:  In the interim, the endotracheal tube has been retracted by at least 2 cm, in a satisfactory location.  The right IJ line terminates in the distal portion of the SVC.  A feeding tube terminates in the abdomen.  There is persistent cardiomegaly with left retrocardiac atelectasis and/or pneumonia.  Small left pleural effusion is again noted, stable.  The right hila is again seen and still prominent.  That could be most likely related to underlying heart failure. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  In the interim, the endotracheal tube has been retracted now positioned 4 cm above the carinal bifurcation. 
2.  Otherwise, no significant interval changes as noted."
"INDICATION:  41-year-old male with recent DKA, now with nausea and vomiting. Evaluate for esophageal tear. 
COMPARISONS:  Comparison is made to AP chest radiograph from [**2120-10-12**]. 
TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  A single AP chest radiograph was reviewed.  The tip of a right subclavian catheter overlies the right brachiocephalic vein at the confluence with the superior vena cava.  The film was not obtained at maximal inspiratory effort; therefore, the lung volumes are low.  The heart, mediastinal, and hilar contours are normal.  The lungs are clear.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothoraces.  Pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits.

IMPRESSION:  Trace blunting of the left costophrenic angle may be due to trace left effusion. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Small right pleural effusion, better demonstrated on abdominal ultrasound. 2.  Patchy perihilar opacities, asymmetrically greater on the right, may reflect a component of underlying edema, although given the symmetry, superimposed atypical pneumonia may be present.  Recommend followup to resolution."
"INDICATIONS:  MVA with multiple injuries. 
THORACIC AND LUMBAR SPINE FILMS: There are multiple posterolateral left rib fractures.  There is patchy opacification in the chest which represents contusion, hemorrhage, or atelectasis. Vertebral bodies are in good alignment. About the level of T8 to 10 there are degenerative changes with end plate sclerosis and osteophytes. The most concerning appearance is at the bottom of T10 where there is end plate irregularity, however, there is also a vacuum phenomenon at this level suggesting that this is degenerative in nature. 
AP and lateral lumbar spine appears normal. 
IMPRESSION:   degenerative changes of lower thoracic vertebral bodies.  An acute upon chronic injury cannot be totally excluded at this level. 
Multiple posterolateral left rib fractures which have been previously described on prior studies."

These findings are stable since prior study.  There is interval improvement in bilateral pleural effusions, now small in size bilaterally.  There is also interval improvement of pulmonary edema, with continued mild interstitial edema seen.  Ill-defined opacity in the right infrahilar region is most likely secondary to atelectasis.  Minimally displaced fracture of the right clavicle is unchanged. Otherwise, osseous structures are unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Cardiomegaly with improved but continued mild pulmonary edema. 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions."
"EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views. 
CLINICAL INFORMATION:  69-year-old male with history of recent spinal fusion with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and hypoxia, rule out pneumonia. 
COMPARISON:  [**2104-4-29**]. 
FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  Patient is rotated slightly to the right.  There are slightly low lung volumes.  Given this, no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable, with the cardiac silhouette top normal.  Right paratracheal opacity is seen, which may most likely represent prominent vasculature as seen on prior CT, it was also seen on prior study from [**2099-1-7**].

"HISTORY:  Bilateral foot infections, evaluation of segmental pressures and PVRs. 
Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral lower extremity arterial system. Bilateral femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial, and dorsalis pedis arteries demonstrate monophasic flow.  Ankle brachial index could not be evaluated secondary to noncompressibility of the arteries.  The pulse-volume recording demonstrates bilateral widened and blunted waveform, more so in the left calf, ankle and metatarsal.  The right and left dorsalis pedis arteries could not be evaluated secondary to overlying bandages, which patient did not want removed. 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Significant aortobiiliac disease, SFA, and tibial disease, greater on the left.  Noncompressible vessels.

SINGLE PORTABLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST AT 9:20 A.M.:  There has been interval removal of an endotracheal tube and a Swan-Ganz catheter with right internal jugular approach.  The nasogastric tube has been removed.  The heart appears slightly enlarged, but this is likely secondary to lordotic positioning.  There is no pleural effusion and pulmonary vasculature is normal.  A slight increase in retrocardiac opacity may be due to atelectasis. Lungs are otherwise clear with no focal consolidation.  Median sternotomy wires are intact.  Aortic calcifications are again noted. 
IMPRESSION:  Interval development of minimal retrocardiac atelectasis; removal of support lines and tubes, without other interval change."
"PROCEDURE:  Chest portable AP. 
REASON FOR EXAM:  Chest drain now attached to an under waterseal. 
FINDINGS:  The small left apical pneumothorax is slightly smaller and the position of the left chest drain is unchanged.  Several lucencies in the retrocardiac region are unchanged since the chest radiograph earlier the today and could be due to a distended esophagus, however other abnormalities such as a supine pneumothorax or herniated intrathoracic bowel loops are other considerations.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged and normal and bibasal consolidation and atelectasis is unchanged. 
IMPRESSION:  A lateral chest radiograph should be performed to evaluate the retrocardiac region.  The findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1186**]."
"INDICATION:  Status-post aortic replacement. Please evaluate for infarct. 
TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast CT of the head

IMPRESSION: 1.  Slightly larger right loculated moderately sized hydropneumothorax with apical and lateral components. 2.  Stable congestive heart failure. 3.  Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions."
"HISTORY:  Crackles at the left lung base. 
PA AND LATERAL CHEST:   Comparison is made to prior study of [**2143-9-9**]. Again noted is mild scoliosis of the thoracic spine.  There is a pacemaker with leads in the right atrium and right ventricle respectively.  The heart is moderately enlarged.  There is calcification of the aortic knob. Again noted is retrocardiac opacity, obscuring the left hemidiaphragm. The left costophrenic angle is blunted. 
IMPRESSION: 
1) Left lower lobe collaps/consolidatione with left sided pleural effusion, and cannot exclude left lower lobe pneumonia. Overall there is no significant change from the prior study. 2) Scoliosis of thoracic spine."
"HISTORY:  74-year-old female with dyspnea, to assess for cardiopulmonary process. 
TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP radiograph of the chest was performed. 
Comparison is made with prior radiograph of [**2145-3-20**]. 
FINDINGS: There is stable appearance to a left subclavian catheter, the tip of which is projected over the right atrium.  There is stable mild cardiomegaly.  There is slight interval increase in the left basal effusion with a stable right basal effusion.  There is added density at the left lung base suggestive of an infiltrate. 
CONCLUSION: Interval increase in the left basal effusion with an infiltrate in the left lower lobe.  Please ensure followup to clearance.  Small right basal effusion is stable."
"HISTORY:  Dysmenorrhea. Questionable fibroids.  Evaluate. 
LMP:  [**2178-5-1**]. 
Transabdominal and transvaginal pelvic ultrasounds were performed, the latter for better evaluation of the endometrium and adnexa.  The uterus is anteverted and measures 8.7 x 5.7 x 7.4 cm.  Uterus does appear bulky and heterogeneous, specifically along the posterior fundal region, however, no discrete uterine fibroids identified.  The endometrium is normal measuring 6 mm.  Both ovaries appear normal with follicular activity.  There is no free fluid or hydronephrosis. 
IMPRESSION:  Bulky slightly heterogeneous uterus, but no discrete fibroids identified."
"CHEST PORTABLE AP: 
REASON FOR EXAM:  Evaluate for fluid overload.  Shortness of breath. 
Findings: The patient is status post CABG.  The extensive airspace opacification involving the left mid and lower lung is stable since the previous chest radiograph; however has significantly worsened since the radiograph of the previous day dated [**2154-7-24**], suggesting a large area of aspiration. The large right pleural effusion is unchanged.  New left lower lobe collapse. 
IMPRESSION:  Slight interval improvement in the extensive left mid and lower lung consolidation, presumably related to massive aspiration, stable large right pleural effusion with new left lower lobe collapse."
"INDICATION:  54-year-old female, history of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, currently on steroid therapy. 
COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to [**2103-12-7**] and CT chest [**2103-12-11**], most recent chest radiograph [**2103-12-21**]. 
TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph. 
FINDINGS:  There has been dramatic improvement in the lungs bilaterally with some residual abnormalities seen in the right mid lung zone.  Lungs are well expanded bilaterally with no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable and within normal limits.  There are several areas of focal pleural thickening on the right.  Otherwise, pleural surfaces are unremarkable.  Minimal stable degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are again noted.  There has been interval removal of a left-sided PICC catheter. 
IMPRESSION:  Substantial but incomplete resolution of COP."
"Chest PA and lateral: 
CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever and white count.  Evaluate for infiltrate. 
FINDINGS:  On lateral view, there is some opacity involving what appears to be the left lower lobe and probably both superior segment and basilar component, likely representing a combination of consolidation as well as pleural effusion, particularly when correlated with the chest CT examinations of [**2141-9-28**].  This corresponds to a retrocardiac opacity on the frontal view probably with elevation of the left hemidiaphragm as well.  The right hemithorax appears grossly unremarkable allowing for techniques.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are essentially unchanged.  Osseous structures are also unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION:  Left retrocardiac opacity correlating with increased opacity in the left lower lobe on lateral view.  Findings are consistent with consolidation, in conjunction with pleural effusion."
"INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and chest pain, status post V-Fib resuscitation.  Concern for CHF or pneumonia. 
TECHNIQUE:  A single portable AP view of the chest was compared with one week ago. 
FINDINGS:  There has been interval increased pleural effusions bilaterally, left greater than right.  The cardiac silhouette appears essentially unchanged, although it is somewhat obscured.  The patient is rotated towards the right. Again seen is a dual chamber left-sided pacemaker with leads in unchanged position.  Patient is status post right humerus fracture, as previously seen.  There is no pneumothorax or other focal pulmonary opacity. 
IMPRESSION: Large left and moderate right pleural effusions."
"CLINICAL HISTORY:  Right thyroid nodule.  History of recent pancreatic carcinoma. 
THYROID BIOPSY 
Initial ultrasound shows a normal left lobe and isthmus. 
Occupying the majority of the right lobe is a nodule that measures 5.1 x 2.8 x 2.5 cm.  This nodule is isoechoic and shows some echogenic foci, some with shadowing, some with comet tailing.  The nodule has modest vascularity. 
These findings were explained to the patient and fine needle aspiration recommended.  Written informed consent was obtained and a formal timeout was taken. 
Local anesthesia was administered and under direct ultrasonic guidance, four fine needle aspirations of the right thyroid nodule were made.  There were no immediate complications. 
IMPRESSION:  Fine needle aspiration of right thyroid nodule."
"INDICATION:  Recent left hip operation, and right-sided pelvic pain.  Evaluate for fracture or dislocation. 
COMPARISON:  [**2133-2-20**]. 
AP VIEW OF THE PELVIS:  The lower sacrum is obscured by overlying bowel gas. There is no sacroiliac or pubic symphysis diastasis.  The pelvic brim appears intact. 
AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE RIGHT AND LEFT HIPS:  Patient is status post bilateral total hip arthroplasty.  There is no evidence of hardware loosening or dislocation.  Again there is a lesser intertrochanteric fracture fragment inferior to the neck of the left hip prosthesis.  No new fracture is identified.  Surgical staples overlie the left hip.

SINGLE AP PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There is interval removal of the left-sided chest tube.  Residual subcutaneous gas is noted in the lateral left chest wall.  There is slight increase of left basilar opacity, representing combination of focal contusion, atelectasis and/or interval increase of small pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax or right pleural effusion.  The right lung and the left upper lung are clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouettes, hilar contours and pulmonary vasculature are normal.  Multiple left lateral rib fractures are grossly unchanged. 
IMPRESSION:  Interval removal of left chest tube without pneumothorax. Slightly increased left basilar opacity could represent combination of contusion, atelectasis, and/or increase of pleural effusion."
"EXAM:  Superficial perirectal ultrasound. 
CLINICAL INDICATION:  Patient on chemotherapy, admitted for neutropenic fever, request superficial ultrasound to evaluate for rectal abscess. 
FINDINGS: 
A seton is documented in the left perirectal tissue and the majority of its course is followed.  There is a trace amount of fluid along the fistula tract without fluid collection or other evidence of abscess.  There is slight inflammation of the tissues around the Seton without significant superficial cellulitis.  The superficial peri-anal region was scanned without identification of new abscess or fistula tract; however, MRI or transrectal ultrasound would be more sensitive for evaluation of the deeper structures. 
IMPRESSION: 
Unchanged appearance of perianal seton without evidence of new abscess or fluid collection."

At L5-S1 level, no abnormalities are seen. 
A small area of signal abnormality at the inferior endplate of L3 appears to be due to a small incidental Schmorl node. 
IMPRESSION:  Mild disc bulging and degenerative changes at L4-5 level.  No evidence of spinal stenosis or foraminal narrowing."
"CHEST PA & LATERAL. 
COMPARISON:  [**2115-10-12**]. 
HISTORY:  Effusion. 
FINDINGS:  There is large right pleural effusion occupying approximately two thirds of the right lung.  Underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.  There is left lung patchy opacities which likely represent vascular congestion, although infectious process cannot be excluded.  There is a retrocardiac increased opacity which may represent atelectasis vs. developing pneumonia. There is a small left pleural effusion. 
IMPRESSION:  Large right pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion. Increased patchy opacities in the left lung field, which may represent vascular congestion or developing infectious process. 
These findings were communicated to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1620**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 39763**] at approximately 3:30 p.m."
"PORTABLE ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND 
CLINICAL INDICATION:  79 year old female with hypothermia, hypotension, elevate liver function tests. 
Portable scans of the abdomen were performed demonstrating a moderately distended gallbladder with no stones or sludge in the lumen.  However, the gallbladder wall appears mildly edematous, a finding which was not seen on a prior ultrasound in [**2195**], nor on CT from [**2198-2-27**].  There is no bile duct dilatation, there is no evidence for ascites or significant pleural effusions and the liver is normal with no intrahepatic ductal dilatation or lesions seen. 
CONCLUSION:  Portable ultrasound studies suggest the possibility of acalculous cholecystitis.  This could be further investigated by a radionuclide biliary scan. The findings were related by telephone to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the covering resident."
"INDICATION:  30-year-old man status post renal transplant, complaining of pain. 
COMPARISON:  [**2152-4-7**]. 
RENAL TRANSPLANT ULTRASOUND:  There is interval resolution of the perinephric fluid collection.  Also seen is interval decrease in the amount of hydronephrosis.  The transplant kidney is in the right lower quadrant measuring 10.1 cm.  The renal artery and vein are widely patent and the resistive indices within the intrarenal arterial branches are approximately 0.46-0.57.  The urinary bladder appears unremarkable.  Again, noted is a slight prominence of the ureteric insertion site.  Ureteropelvic pelviectasis is present.

COMPARISON:  [**2129-6-4**]. 
TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial CT images through the brain without contrast. 
CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There is no intracranial mass lesion, hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures or intra- or extracranial hemorrhage.  There is prominence of the sulci and ventricles consistent with cerebral atrophy.  Vascular calcifications are again noted.  Hypodensities in the periventricular white matter are noted and nonspecific, likely representing chronic microvascular ischemic changes.  The osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable. 
The visualized paranasal sinuses are unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial pathology including no sign of intracranial hemorrhage."
"INDICATION:  51-year-old man status post CABG two weeks ago, now with sternal click and drainage.  Study to evaluate for sternal wires.

Comparison is made to prior CT torso and supine chest radiograph obtained on same date. 
SUPINE CHEST RADIOGRAPH 
In the interval, there is an endotracheal tube, which terminates approximately 10 cm from the carina.  Orogastric tube is no longer identified.  There has been interval development of right upper lobe collapse causing rightward mediastinal shift and elevation of the hila.  Irregular opacity projecting over the right heart border likely also represents area of atelectasis within the right lower lobe.  Small band of linear atelectasis is noted at the left base.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax. 
IMPRESSION: 
Interval development of right upper lobe collapse likely related to mucous plug.  Malpositioned endotracheal tube. 
Findings discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 232**] on date of exam at 7:30 a.m."

PORTABLE CHEST:  Comparison is made to previous films from  one day earlier. 
An endotracheal tube is presentwith the tip proximally located, terminating approximately .7 cm above the carina.  Swan-Ganz catheter is in the region of the right ventricular outflow tract and a central venous catheter is in satisfactory position.  The heart size is stable.  The lungs reveal multifocal patchy alveolar opacities as well as an underlying interstitial pattern. Bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. 
IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube terminates well above the thoracic inlet, approximately 8.7 cm above the carina as communicated to clinical service caring for the patient. 
No significant change in multifocal alveolar opacities, presumably due to pneumonia.  Pleural effusions are also stable."
"VENOUS MAPPING OF THE LOWER EXTREMITIES 
INDICATION:  74-year-old woman with history of venous stripping, undergoing evaluation prior to CABG and aortic valve replacement. 
TECHNIQUE:  Grayscale and Doppler ultrasound images of bilateral lower extremity venous system were obtained. 
FINDINGS:  Bilateral greater saphenous veins are not visualized on the current study, most probably due to prior venous stripping.  Bilateral small saphenous veins are patent.  The diameter of the right small saphenous vein is ranging from 0.23-0.31 cm and on the left is from 0.25-0.31 cm. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Status post bilateral venous stripping, therefore, bilateral greater saphenous veins are not visualized. 2.  Patent bilateral small saphenous veins with measurements as above."
"HISTORY:   88 y/o with new CVL. 
The right subclavian CVL remains in place.  The tip is in the distal superior vena cava.  Tip appears to be slightly higher at this time than on the previous study.  Cardiomegaly is again noted as well as continued application of the ET tube and NG tube.  The tip of the NG tube is at the gastric fundus and the tip of the ET tube is 6.7 cm above the carina.  Patchy infiltration in the right upPer lobe and right middle lobe are unchanged.  No evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion. 
IMPRESSION:   Since the previous study there has been partial withdrawal of the right subclavian CVP line.  No other significant changes are noted."
"HISTORY:  Fracture. 
Three radiographs of the right wrist demonstrate mineralization to be at the lower limits of normal.  The scapholunate interval is widened, representing scapholunate ligament injury.  There is positive ulnar variance measuring 3 mm.  Subchondral cyst formation is seen to involve the proximal pole of the scaphoid.  The scapholunate angle is normal on the lateral view.  Soft tissues are unremarkable.  There is subchondral sclerosis involving the ulnar aspect of the proximal lunate. 
IMPRESSION: 
Widening of the scapholunate interval.  The finding represents scapholunate ligament injury.  If clinically indicated, this would be better characterized with wrist MR arthrogram. 
Positive ulnar variance measuring 3 mm.  Associated degenerative changes along the ulnar aspect of the lunate reflect ulnar abutment."
"INDICATION:  59-year-old male with chest pain. 
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph available from [**2140-8-18**]. 
FINDINGS:  Upright frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The patient is status post median sternotomy.  The heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are within normal limits and unchanged since the prior examination.  There is no focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion.

IMPRESSION:  Unchanged multiple pulmonary nodules.  No acute intrathoracic process."
"CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE: 
REASON:  New stroke. 
FINDINGS:  Duplex evaluation is performed of both carotid arteries.  No plaque was evident on the right.  On the left, internal carotid artery appeared to be occluded. 
On the right, peak systolic velocities are 84, 93, 66 in the ICA, CCA, and ECA respectively.  The ICA-CCA ratio is 0.9.  This is consistent with no stenosis. 
On the left, as noted the internal carotid artery appears occluded.  In the remainder of the vessel the peak systolic velocities are 90, 70 in the CCA and ECA respectively. 
There is antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries. 
IMPRESSION:  The left internal carotid artery appears occluded.  However ultrasound is not 100% accurate in differentiating between the total and near total occlusion.  Clinical correlation and possible MRA is warrante.  On the right, there is no evidence of stenosis."

"RENAL ULTRASOUND SCAN 
CLINICAL DETAILS:  Query chronic renal disease. 
FINDINGS:  Right kidney is normal in size measuring 11.5 cm in length with regular renal cortical outline and normal cortical thickness.  No hydronephrosis or hydroureter. 
The left kidney is smaller measuring 9 cm in length.  Renal cortical outline appears regular, no hydronephrosis or hydroureter.  This asymmetry in the size of the kidneys could be due to left renovascular disease for example. 
Ureteric jets are demonstrated from distal right and left ureter with color Doppler.  The moderately distended urinary bladder is unremarkable. 
CONCLUSION: 
Normal-appearing kidneys, but smaller (9 cm) left kidney, possibilities include left renal vascular disease for example.  No hydronephrosis."
"PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON [**2109-12-18**]. 
COMPARISON:  None. 
CLINICAL HISTORY:  53-year-old woman with intubation, now hypoxic, question tube placement or pneumonia. 
FINDINGS:  Single AP portable view of the chest is obtained.  Right CP angle is excluded.  Endotracheal tube is seen with its tip located approximately 5.5 cm above the carina.  An NG tube courses into the left upper quadrant though its tip is excluded from view.  Underpenetrated technique somewhat limits the evaluation of the lungs.  Scattered opacities likely reflect atelectasis or bronchovascular crowding, though early pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. Heart size is grossly unremarkable.  Mediastinal contour cannot be accurately assessed given patient rotation to the left.  Bones appear intact. 
IMPRESSION:  ET tube positioned adequately.  NG tube tip not visualized. Limited evaluation of the lungs, though no gross abnormality.  Repeat if there is strong clinical concern.                                                                       SESHa"

"HISTORY:  Interval film. 
CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW. 
The lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with COPD.  There is cardiomegaly, unchanged.  Enlarged pulmonary arteries with tapered appearance is highly suggestive of pulmonary hypertension.  There is patchy opacity diffusely throughout both lungs.  There are bibasilar effusions and underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  Extreme lower lungs are excluded from the film. Although detail on the current film is difficult to discern due to respiratory motion and overpenetration, the overall appearance is similar to the film from [**2170-8-11**] and is most suggestive of CHF superimposed on COPD.  The possibility of an underlying pneumonic infiltrate cannot be entirely excluded, but is considered less likely.

FINDINGS:  Two views are compared with studies dated [**2-14**] and [**2162-2-12**].  There is persistent prominence of interstitial markings, right more than left, which may represent asymmetric pulmonary edema, with accentuation of the oblique fissures, but no significant pleural effusion.  There is rounded left ventricular enlargement, as before, related to the underlying aortic valvular disease.  No focal airspace process is seen.  There are degenerative changes involving both shoulder joints. 
IMPRESSION:  Stable asymmetric interstitial edema, right more than left."
"INDICATION:  67-year-old male with recent central line placement. 
COMPARISON:  [**2127-12-1**]. 
UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST: 
There is a new right IJ central line, which likely reaches the upper SVC. This could be advanced for optimal central positioning.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  There is no pleural effusion. 
There is persistent bibasilar opacity, left greater than right, likely atelectasis.  There is no focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.

IMPRESSION:  No pneumothorax status post right IJ central line placement.  The line terminates in the proximal SVC."
"REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the chest tube placement. 
The patient is after MVA. 
The ET tube tip projects 4 cm above the carina.  The left chest tube is inserted with its tip projecting over the superomedial aspect of the left lower lobe. 
The recent opacification of the whole left lung is more prominent in the lung bases, which is most probably due to parenchymal contusion and pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  There is no evidence of sizeable pneumothorax. There are several rib fractures on the left involving the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth ribs. 
There is _____ distention of stomach. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Status post insertion of the ET tube and chest tube. 2.  Suspected contusion of the left lung and multiple rib fractures. 3.  Acute distention of the stomach."

COMPARISON:  Multiple prior examinations including a CT intraprocedure from [**2153-9-13**], a CT chest from [**2153-7-7**], and chest radiograph most recently from [**2153-3-14**]. 
FINDINGS:  There is a small-to-moderate left apical pneumothorax without evidence of tension. Collapsed left lower lobe probably still exists when compared to prior radiograph.  Greater mediastinal widening is seen.  At the left perihilar region, several small opacities exist which could represent pulmonary nodules.  The right lung is clear.  There are no pleural effusions. The cardiac silhouette is unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Small to moderate left-sided apical pneumothorax. 2.  Collapsed lower lobe. 3.  Possible nodules at the left perihilar region.  Would recommend diuresing the patient and repeating a PA radiograph to better evaluate."
"INDICATION:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old with CHF, intubated.  Assess left IJ placement. 
PORTABLE SUPINE FRONTAL RADIOGRAPH:  Comparison is made to one hour prior. There has been interval placement of a left IJ central venous catheter with its tip terminating in the distal SVC.  No pneumothorax is identified on the supine radiograph.  An NG tube has also been placed whose tip is off the edge of the film, but likely within the distal stomach or proximal duodenum.  CHF is unchanged from one hour prior. 
IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory position of left IJ central venous catheter.  No pneumothorax."
"INDICATIONS:  This infant is the product of a 29 week gestation and is on day of life #2.  He had intrauterine cocaine and heroin exposure.  This is his first head ultrasound. 
HEAD ULTRASOUND:  The left lateral ventricle is much smaller than the right lateral ventricle. Please note that the infant was laying on his left side. There is no evidence for hemorrhage.  The overall cerebral and cerebellar architecture is within range of normal limits. 
IMPRESSION:  There can be some asymmetry in the size of the lateral ventricles.  The dependent ventricle tends to be the smaller. However, this asymmetry is unusually prominent and should be followed. The relatively small size of the left lateral ventricle may be evidence for left cerebral edema. There is no suggestion of hemorrhage at this time. This infant will need close ultrasound followup."

Compared to previous study of earlier the same date at 15:48. 
INDICATION:  Nasogastric tube placement. 
Since the recent chest radiograph, a nasogastric tube has been advanced, now terminating in the distal stomach.  Other lines and tubes are unchanged in position.  The lung volumes are slightly increased compared to the previous study, likely contributing to the apparent improvement in multifocal bilateral pulmonary opacities.  When compared to an earlier study of the same date with more similar lung volumes, the appearance of the lungs has not significantly changed. 
IMPRESSION:  Advancement of nasogastric tube, now terminating in the distal stomach."
"INDICATION:  Evaluate placement of feeding tube. 
PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY:  Comparison made to study from [**2172-10-6**].  Again seen is a Dobbhoff tube with the tip positioned in the gastric antrum and unchanged from previous exam.  A left-sided subclavian central venous catheter is again seen with the tip positioned in the mid SVC.  Opacity at the left base is again seen, representing previously noted effusion and atelectasis, which is relatively unchanged from previous exam.  The heart size and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  No pneumothoraces are seen.  Poor inspiratory effort with low lung volumes is seen, and unchanged from previous exam.

The patient is intubated with the tip of the ET tube approximately 6.5 cm above the carina.  There are bilateral pleural drains and mediastinal drain together with a Swan-Ganz catheter, the tip of which appears to be in the main pulmonary artery.  Increased retrocardiac density on the left side likely represents atelectasis/airspace disease of the left lower lobe.  Linear density is seen overlying the right lower chest which may represent some loculated fluid. 
IMPRESSION: 
Status post AVR with postoperative changes as described above."
"INDICATION: Followup film for pneumothorax with chest tube. 
COMPARISON: [**2186-2-11**] at 16:37. 
FINDINGS: Compared to prior study the chest tube has been slightly reoriented with its tip now adjacent to the right paratracheal mediastinum. There are bilateral effusions and the left costophrenic sulcus is showing increased density. This could be atelectasis or pneumonia.

FINDINGS:  Eleven spot fluoroscopic images were obtained without a radiologist present.  Images demonstrate cannulization of the CBD with injection of contrast.  The common bile duct is mildly dilated, with multiple filling defects seen.  Per ERCP report, multiple stones were extracted with a balloon catheter.  Visualized osseous structures reveal severe degenerative disease of the lumbar spine, with vertebral planum of L1 vertebral body. 
IMPRESSION:  Mild dilatation of the CBD, with multiple stones."
"INDICATION:  Bradycardia. 
TECHNIQUE:  Single portable chest radiograph was compared to multiple prior radiographs, the most recent dated [**2172-5-11**]. 
FINDINGS:  There are low lung volumes.  Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right are present, with likely left lower lobe atelectasis.  The appearance is not significantly different from the prior radiographs.  No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia is seen, though an underlying process at the left base cannot be entirely excluded.  No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax is identified.  Leads from defibrillator pads are seen overlying the left hemithorax.  There are calcifications of the tracheobronchial tree and aortic knob and degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine.

"CHEST RADIOGRAPH, AP SEMI-UPRIGHT 
HISTORY:  57-year-old male status post intubation subsequent to PEA arrest. Evaluate interval change. 
FINDINGS:  AP semi-upright chest, comparison study 2:53 a.m., demonstrates interval increase in lung volumes.  Apparent improvement in the bilateral acinar opacities may be secondary to increased volume.  Endotracheal tube is 5.2 cm above carina.  Heart and mediastinal contours are normal.  Costophrenic sulci are sharp.  Multiple bilateral healed rib fractures are again noted. Apical pleural thickening is present. 
IMPRESSION:  Apparent improvement in edema may be due in part to elevated PEEP."
"INDICATION:  Status post fall, rule out injury. 
TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained through the lumbar spine without intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were obtained. 
FINDINGS:  There is a comminuted fracture of the L1 vertebral body with circumferential expulsion of bony fragments.  There is retropulsion of osseous fragments into the spinal canal, with moderate narrowing(50 %) of the central canal at this level.  There is also extension of this fracture into the posterior elements, specifically the right-sided lamina at this level.  No additional fractures are identified.  The alignment of the lumbar spine is otherwise unremarkable.  There is moderate loss of the vertebral body height of L1.

Comparison is made to the chest radiographs from [**2136-6-4**]. 
AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Again seen is a right internal jugular central venous line, mediastinal drain, and left-sided chest tube.  The heart size and mediastinal contours and pulmonary vasculature are stable in appearance. There is increased intensity of the right upper lobe infiltrate, with decreased prominence of the right lower and left lower lobe infiltrates.  The left lower lobe is better expanded on today's study.  These findings may represent aspiration, but the appearance of the right upper lobe infiltrate is consistent with an infectious etiology.  The osseous structures are stable. 
IMPRESSION:  Improvement in bibasilar infiltrates with worsening in right upper lobe infiltrate, suspicious for a pneumonic process."
"INDICATION:  Post-tracheostomy and NG tube placement. 
COMPARISON:  Radiograph dated [**2144-10-26**]. 
AP SEMI-UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST:  There is interval placement of a tracheostomy tube in standard position.  The NG tube appears to course through the airway, terminating in the left lung parenchyma laterally.  A right-sided subclavian line is unchanged and in satisfactory position.  There is interval improvement in bibasilar opacities. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  NG tube appears to course through the airways into the left lung.  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 52349**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 34339**] was informed of this result at the time of interpretation of the study. 2.  Interval improvement in bibasilar opacities."

Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated [**2114-4-5**]. 
A portable supine chest film [**2114-10-7**] at 13:05 is submitted. 
IMPRESSION: 
The nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the expected location of the stomach  Patchy bibasilar opacities, left greater than right, are concerning for pneumonia or aspiration, less likely atelectasis.  There is also patchy opacity at the right lung apex, which was previously present and may represent an area of atelectasis or prominent vascular structures.  Due to patient rotation, the overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess.  Probable layering right effusion.  No pneumothorax.  No evidence of pulmonary edema. Persistent low lung volumes."

Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2124-8-31**] as well as chest CT from [**2124-8-29**]. 
The patient is after recent surgery of the lower cervical upper thoracic spine with unchanged appearance of the inserted hardware.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged including the partial consolidation of the right lower lobe.  The left basal opacities have progressed in the interim and compared to both chest radiograph from several hours ago, and most likely compared to chest CT, although note is made that they represent a combination of opacities and known metastatic pulmonary nodules.  There is no interval increase in pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax. 
IMPRESSION:  The concern for infectious process at the left lung base and potentially in the right lung base is still remaining."

INDICATION: Coronary artery disease, s/p CABG. Chest and mediastinal tubes removed. Evaluate for pneumothorax. 
FINDINGS: A single AP semi-upright view. Comparison study dated [**2147-2-9**]. A Swan catheter and left chest tube have now been removed. The heart again shows fairly marked enlargement, mainly left ventricular. S/P CABG surgery is again noted. There is some improvement in the lung inflation since the prior study and this is associated with some decrease in the small bilateral subpulmonary effusions. The pulmonary vessels do not indicate cardiac failure at this time. 
IMPRESSION: Overall slight improvement in the appearances of the heart and lungs. There is no evidence of cardiac failure at this time."
"INDICATION:  Check endotracheal tube. 
AP UPRIGHT CHEST:  Compared to the film of 1 hour prior.  The left hemithorax has been excluded from this film.  Endotracheal tube is seen approximately 4 cm above the carina.  No pneumothorax is identified but the extreme lung apices are excluded.  NG line is seen with its tip at the GE junction.  This should be advanced several cm.

"INDICATION:  27-year-old female with hepatocellular carcinoma and tachypnea. 
COMPARISON:  AP portable chest x-ray dated [**2175-10-13**]. 
AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY:  A left subclavian Port-A-Cath is in unchanged position with tip in the right atrium.  The lung volumes are low. Left lower lobe consolidation has progressed in the interval, consistent with worsening pneumonia, atelectasis, and effusion.  Linear atelectasis within the right lung base persists.  Multiple pulmonary nodules consistent with known metastases are again identified.  There is an IVC filter to the right of the T12 vertebral body. 
IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes, with interval progression of left lower lobe consolidation.  This could represent worsening pneumonia, atelectasis, or effusion.  Correlation with lateral view would be helpful."

"CHEST RADIOGRAPH 
INDICATIONS:  Fever and oxygen requirement. 
COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from the prior day or CT dated abdominal CT from [**2142-12-23**]. 
TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright. 
FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  A new moderate pleural effusion is seen on the right with associated parenchymal opacity.  Patchy opacity likely residing in the lingula is most suggestive of minor atelectasis or scarring. There is a similar left lower lobe opacity, previously shown as a chronic finding.  Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  A biliary stent project over the right upper quadrant. 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  New small-to-moderate right-sided pleural effusion with parenchymal opacity which could probably be explained by compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia is an additional differential consideration. 
2.  Similar left lower lung opacity which is a more chronic finding."
"HISTORY:  46-year-old male with recent V-TACH, abdominal pain.  Rule out pneumonia, check pacer placement. 
COMPARISON:  [**2188-9-19**]. 
CHEST, PA AND LATERAL:  Dual lead pacer defibrillator with leads terminating in the right atrium and floor of the right ventricle is unchanged in position. Heart size is moderately enlarged with bilateral perihilar prominence and increased interstitial markings and vascular redistribution.  These findings are compatible with mild CHF.  Lungs are mildly hyperinflated, which suggests COPD or small airways obstruction.  No pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.

INDICATION: Check status following line placement. R/O pneumothorax. 
FINDINGS: Single AP supine view. Comparison study of [**2190-4-20**] taken upright. A right IJ central line is noted, in good position with its tip in the mid SVC. The ETT and the NG tube also appear satisfactorily positioned. There is moderate left ventricular enlargement of the heart and there also is evidence of some prominence of both hilar regions and possible widening of superior mediastinum. These changes are partly due to the supine position of the patient. This should be re-evaluated with the patient upright when clinically feasible. No new pulmonary infiltrates or pleural effusions demonstrated. 
IMPRESSION: Widening of superior mediastinum and prominence of hila probably postural. An upright view is recommended when possible."
"INDICATION:  A 64-year-old woman status post intubation, query tube position. 
COMPARISON:  [**2112-6-18**]. 
SINGLE PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  In this kyphotic view, the endotracheal tube is at the lower portion of the thoracic inlet and is probably in normal position.  Orogastric tube and side hole are coarse below the diaphragm and out of the field of view.  Median sternotomy wires are seen. Heart size is top normal given technique.  The mediastinum appears widened. There are ill-defined opacities throughout both lungs with a perihilar predominance.  There may be small pleural effusions.  There is no large pneumothorax. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Probably standard position of endotracheal tube.  Could consider PA and lateral for better definition. 
2.  Perihilar predominant, ill-defined airspace opacification suggests pulmonary edema.  Underlying infection cannot be excluded.  Could consider another film after diuresis."

"AP PORTABLE CHEST, [**2104-5-19**] AT 1652 HOURS. 
HISTORY:  Pneumothorax with worsening hypoxia. 
COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated earlier same day. 
FINDINGS:  Lung volumes remain markedly low with diffuse interstitial and alveolar edema again present.  The prominent skinfold is again identified mimicking a pneumothorax of the right lung.  Marked cardiomegaly is again seen.  Air bronchograms are noted in the left retrocardiac region which may be due to atelectasis and edema however superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right again noted and stable. 
IMPRESSION:  Relatively stable chest x-ray examination again demonstrating likely cardiogenic pulmonary edema.  There is question of a possible retrocardiac infiltrate.  Repeat radiography after appropriate diuresis recommended to assess for underlying infection."

COMPARISON:  [**2139-6-28**]. 
TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable supine chest. 
FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is in place with tip terminating 2.7 cm from the carina.  There has been interval placement of a right subclavian venous access catheter with tip in lower SVC.  No pneumothorax is identified.  The heart size and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  There is mild linear opacity and volume loss within the left lower lobe consistent with atelectasis. 
Surgical clips in the right upper quadrant are consistent with prior cholecystectomy.  The nasogastric tube has been removed. 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Right internal jugular venous access catheter in satisfactory position. No pneumothorax.

"INDICATION:  Assess IJ line placement. 
Portable AP chest dated [**12-3**] is compared to the prior study dated [**2144-12-2**]. 
FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a left IJ which terminates within the left brachiocephalic vein.  The pulmonary artery catheter has been advanced such that it now terminates within the right pulmonary artery.  The tracheostomy tube and feeding tube remain in stable position.  There are two left-sided chest tubes terminating within the mid zone.  There is a persistent moderate-sized left pleural effusion with probable associated compression atelectasis of the left lower lobe.  An underlying pneumonic process in this area cannot be excluded. 
IMPRESSION:

2.  Stable appearance of left pleural effusion."
"INDICATION:  78-year-old woman with right temporal bleed and poor VA in the right eye. 
TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT. 
FINDINGS:  Compared with the examination of [**2130-4-8**], there has been no change in the large right basal ganglia intraparenchymal hemorrhage with mass effect upon the ipsilateral lateral ventricle.  A small convex hyperdensity at the right frontal convexity, near the vertex, either represents a small meningioma or a tiny subdural hematoma.  This has been unchanged since [**4-7**], [**2130**]. There is no evidence of herniation.  The ambient cistern is present and normal. 
IMPRESSION:  No change from the prior examination in the large right basal ganglia hemorrhage."
"PORTABLE ABDOMEN. 
INDICATION:  History of CAD status post CABG and CHF.  Evaluate for ileus or obstruction. 
FINDINGS: Abdominal AP portable upright only films show mild dilation of small bowel loops with gas diffusely throughout the colon.  Incidentally noted in the lung bases are bilateral pleural effusions with concurrent atelectasis. There is mild lumbar scoliosis with extensive degenerative changes bilaterally.  The cecum is not unduly dilated.  Lung bases are obscured however there is no obvious free air.  There are no soft tissue calcifications. 
IMPRESSION:  Mild ileus with no evidence of obstruction.  Considering strong cardiac history, mesenteric ischemia cannot be definitively ruled out on this examination and if clinically suspected should be further pursued."
"INDICATION: Pleural effusion follow-up. 
CHEST X-RAY:  Comparison is made  to prior study from three days earlier.  The previously noted left subclavian central venous catheter is unchanged in position, with its tip in the SVC. There is a new nasogastric tube with its tip in the stomach.  A tube of some type again projects over the right upper quadrant. 
There is still increased density in the right base silhouetting the right hemidiaphragm, consistent with pleural effusion. This may be slightly smaller in the interval. There may also be some subpulmonic pleural fluid and/or right diaphragmatic elevation contributing to this density. No acute pleural/parenchymal abnormalities are identified. 
IMPRESSION: 
1) Central venous catheter tip without change. 2) New nasogastric tube tip in stomach. 3) Persistent right pleural effusion, which may have decreased slightly in size in the interval (see above comments)."
"HISTORY:  Motor vehicle collision with confusion, hallucination. 
COMPARISON:  None. 
TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast head CT.

"HISTORY: Assess pacemaker leads. 
2 views of the chest are compared to a previous study dated [**2127-8-5**]. There are dual lead left sided pacemaker, the leads are appropriate in position. The heart and mediastinal contours are stable. There is a persistent blunting of both costophrenic angles consistent with pleural effusion. There is prominence of the bronchopulmonary markings suggesting mild congestive failure. This is unchanged. The loculated pleural effusion within the left major fissure is slightly decreased in size. The right sided PICC line is in appropriate position. 
IMPRESSION: 
Mild congestive failure with bilateral pleural effusion. The loculated pleural effusion in the left major fissure is slightly decreased in size."
"Compared to previous study of earlier the same date. 
CLINICAL INDICATION:  Fever and WBC count. 
The lung volumes are quite low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures.  The heart remains enlarged and the pulmonary vascularity remain engorged.  There has been apparent increased perihilar haziness as well as interval development of patchy opacities at the lung bases, somewhat more confluent in the left lower lobe than the right. 
IMPRESSION:  Limited assessment of the chest due to low lung volumes.  There is mild CHF present.  Bibasilar lung opacities may reflect atelectasis or pneumonia."
"INDICATION:  Basilar artery stenosis with basal ganglia bleed. 
Comparison is made to the prior CT dated [**2137-1-17**]. 
TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast head CT. 
FINDINGS:  Compared to the prior study, there has been no significant interval change in the moderate-sized hemorrhage in the right basal ganglia extending into the ventricular system.  There is again identified an expanded blood- filled right temporal [**Doctor Last Name 383**] with subependymal edema.  There is again no shift of normally midline structures.  There is again identified a small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the left parietal lobe.  Scattered periventricular and subcortical white matter hyperdensities are again appreciated consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic changes.  The paranasal sinuses and osseous structures are unchanged in appearance. 
IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change."
"INDICATION:  New right PICC. 
COMPARISON:  [**2169-1-13**], [**2169-4-30**], [**2171-7-26**]. 
FINDINGS:  A right PICC ends in the upper SVC with the catheter tip 8 mm beyond the wire.  If desired, the catheter could be advanced 5 cm to place it in the low SVC.  The lungs are otherwise clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal, without pulmonary vascular engorgement. 
IMPRESSION:  Right PICC ends in the upper SVC. 
Discussed with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 50729**] (IV team) by phone at 10:53 a.m. [**2171-8-8**]."
"MRA AND MRV 
HISTORY:  HIV with mental status changes and possible seizure.  Is there evidence of venous sinus thrombosis? 
MR arteriography and MR venography were performed.  No contrast was administered.  Comparison to the brain MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**2136-12-15**]. 
FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of arterial or dural venous sinus thrombosis. There is normal flow and no vascular anomalies detected. 
CONCLUSION:  No evidence of thrombosis of major arteries or of the dural venous sinuses."
"AP CHEST, 8:10 A.M. [**2150-1-25**] 
HISTORY:  CHF. 
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**1-18**] through 24: 
Widespread pulmonary consolidation has progressed over the past five days, and although it is most severe in the right upper and lower lungs, which would otherwise suggest pneumonia, review of recent radiographic history suggests this is a recurrence of severe asymmetric pulmonary edema, particularly since moderate cardiomegaly is more pronounced.  Left lower lobe has been airless several days, probably collapsed.  The endotracheal portion of the tracheostomy tube is still oriented horizontally and should be evaluated clinically to see if this is appropriate.  Left jugular line ends in the left brachiocephalic vein.  At least small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed, but not progressed.  There is no pneumothorax."
"PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM, [**2171-5-25**] AT 13:21 
CLINICAL INDICATION:  72-year-old with coronary artery disease, going for CABG, followup for questionable soft tissue opacity seen only on the lateral view. 
PA and lateral views, [**2171-5-25**] at 13:21 are compared to [**2171-5-24**] at 18:49. 
IMPRESSION: 
There is interval improvement in aeration.  The lungs are clear with no evidence of focal airspace consolidation, pleural effusions, pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  The rounded soft tissue opacity on the lateral projection on the study of [**2171-5-24**] is no longer apparent and therefore likely corresponded to superimposed shadows.  Degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine. Heart remains upper limits of normal size, and the aorta remains somewhat unfolded and tortuous."
"INDICATION:  COPD, intubated, with chest tube.  Evaluate change. 
TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest was compared with multiple prior examinations, the most recent of which was [**2176-1-17**]. 
FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube remains approximately 4 cm above the carina.  NG tube extends into the stomach, and beyond the inferior edge of this film. Left basilar chest tube remains unchanged in position.  There is again seen a small amount of subcutaneous emphysema at the left chest wall, which continues to decrease over subsequent examinations. 
The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes remain unchanged.  There is a persistent appearance of mild CHF superimposed upon a background of emphysema. Small bilateral pleural effusions persist.  There has been minimal interval change since the prior examinations. 
IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change."
"HISTORY:  Pneumothorax. 
Single portable radiograph of the chest again demonstrates extensive subcutaneous emphysema along the left chest wall.  Bilateral pleural effusions persist and are similar in appearance to that seen on the chest radiograph obtained two hours prior.  Support lines are unchanged.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Patient is again noted to be status post CABG.  The mediastinal contours are unchanged.  The previously seen left lower lung opacity persists.

COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated earlier same day. 
FINDINGS:  The patient was imaged on the frontal projection in somewhat apical lordotic position.  The study again demonstrates a right internal jugular approach central line.  While the course is slightly medial on the AP view, the relatively direct course on the lateral view is reassuring four superior vena cava placement.  Again, no pneumothorax is noted.  The cardiac silhouette remains massively enlarged, but stable.  Not mentioned previously, sclerotic focus is again noted centrally in the right clavicle, likely a bone island, which is stable compared to multiple prior exams. 
IMPRESSION:  Lateral view is reassuring for superior vena cava placement. Again correlate clinically with blood drawn and the course of the placement procedure."
"INDICATION:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with prostate CA, gastric CA now with small bowel obstruction and elevated white blood cells evaluation for possible pneumonia. 
FINDINGS:  Bilateral interstitial opacification of the lungs.  There is bilateral pleural effusions of minimal to moderate degree.  The hila are enlarged and not distinctly seen.  There is cardiomegaly.  Opacification may be seen in the left lower lung with an air bronchogram within it. 
IMPRESSION:  Bilateral interstitial opacification and pleural effusions with cardiomegaly and indistinctiveness of the hila.  Left lower lobe opacification as described.  The changes may be compatible with congestive heart failure but further follow up is needed to better characterize the left lower lobe area and exclude other processes."
"HISTORY: Biliary sepsis. 
COMPARISON: Outside portable chest x-ray dated [**2121-7-20**] from [**Hospital1 2130**]. 
UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST:  Low lung volumes are again noted.  There is an NG tube which coils twice in the region of the neck and once in the vicinity of the lower esophagus with its tip pointing cephalad within the mid esophagus. There is also density in the retrocardiac region on the left.  The patient has a known hiatal hernia seen on an upper GI study from [**Hospital1 **] done in [**2120-12-8**].  The NG tube may in fact coil within the hernia sac.  There are no focal consolidations.  There is no effusion or pneumothorax. 
IMPRESSION: NG tube coils possibly in the hypopharynx and also coiled either in the distal esophagus or within hiatal hernia."
"LIMITED ULTRASOUND OF THE ABDOMEN 
INDICATION:  38-year-old man with significant gastric varices and MV stenosis status post stent placement, please evaluate for patency of SMV stent. 
COMPARISON:  No ultrasound comparison available. 
FINDINGS:  The portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow.  The SMV stent cannot be directly visualized secondary to significant bowel gas.  However, the SMV is visualized proximal to the stent and flow is patent.  Since flow is demonstrated proximal and distal to the site of the stent, we infer the stent itself to be patent. 
IMPRESSION:  Inferred patency of SMV stent though not directly visualized."
"HISTORY:  53-year-old woman with renal transplant. 
COMPARISON:  Renal ultrasound, [**2152-5-24**]. 
FINDINGS:  Renal ultrasound was performed of the renal transplant in the left hemipelvis.  The renal transplant measures 12.3 cm.  There is no evidence of hydronephrosis or perinephric fluid. 
Doppler evaluation of the transplant shows symmetric flow through the kidney, and resistive indices range from 0.85 at the upper pole, 0.82 to 0.88 at the mid pole, and 0.81 to 0.83 at lower pole, and in the main renal artery of 0.89. Normal flow is seen in the renal vein. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Slight increase in resistive indices in all poles of the transplant kidney compared to prior study, now ranging from 0.81 to 0.89. 2.  No hydronephrosis or perinephric fluid."
