"PA AND LATERAL CHEST, [**2102-4-16**] 
OMPARISON:  [**2102-4-14**]. 
FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Airspace consolidation in the left lower lobe has worsened and is concerning for an evolving pneumonia.  Subtle hazy ground-glass opacity lateral to right hilum could reflect an additional site of infection.  Bronchial wall thickening is mild and suggest coexisting airways infection or inflammation.  Small pleural effusions are present bilaterally, left greater than right. 
IMPRESSION:  Evolving pneumonia in left lower lobe as well as possible new site of infection in right perihilar region.  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 35223**] was telephoned with these findings on [**2102-4-16**] at 10 a.m.",0

Comparison is made with prior study from [**2172-8-4**].  
CLINICAL HISTORY:  63-year-old man with altered mental status. IMPRESSION: Chest radiograph obtained on [**2172-8-9**] shows significant interval worsening of the patient's overall pulmonary findings compared to the prior study on [**2172-8-4**]. The lungs display increased opacification, most prominently at the lung bases, indicating the progression of underlying pathology such as atelectasis or inflammatory processes like pneumonia. Bilateral pleural effusion is also noted, a new finding since the prior study. 

The cardiac silhouette appears moderately enlarged, likely exacerbated by the lower lung volumes. Newly observed pulmonary vascular engorgement suggests early signs of cardiac decompensation. 

Additionally, gaseous dilatation of the intestinal tract in the upper abdomen is seen, indicating a new digestive tract abnormality. No pneumoperitoneum or pneumothorax is visualized. 

Furthermore, a severe compression fracture of an upper lumbar vertebral body is more pronounced on this study compared to [**2172-8-4**]. It is difficult to ascertain whether this represents a genuine change due to differences in inspiration levels. This fracture may be contributing to the patient's reported pain, which could in turn be causing atelectasis and hypoxia. 

Overall, the chest radiograph demonstrates worsening pulmonary findings, new pleural effusion, cardiac enlargement, intestinal tract abnormality, and exacerbation of vertebral compression fracture. These findings are indicative of deteriorating clinical status.",1

"INDICATION:  59-year-old male with necrotizing pancreatitis, evaluate portal system.  
ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND:  Comparison was made with a prior abdominal CT dated [**2123-2-13**]. Abdominal ultrasound was performed to evaluate the portal system in a 59-year-old male with necrotizing pancreatitis. The findings were compared to a prior abdominal CT from [**2123-2-13**]. The liver is enlarged with multiple hypoechoic lesions consistent with hepatic abscesses, which are unchanged from the prior CT. There is also mild splenomegaly. The portal vein appears patent and there is no evidence of thrombosis. Mild ascites is present. No gallbladder wall thickening or bile duct dilatation is identified. The pancreas shows diffuse echogenicity consistent with necrotizing pancreatitis. There is no evidence of pancreatic pseudocysts or fluid collections. Impression: Enlarged liver with hepatic abscesses, mild splenomegaly, and diffuse necrotizing pancreatitis.",1
"INDICATION:  Hypoxia, assess for acute process.  
TECHNIQUE:  Single AP upright radiograph of the chest. There is no mention of an AP upright radiograph of the chest. However, if we are to continue the report based on the information given, it would state the following:

The supine portable chest radiograph shows a slight improvement in the opacification of the left hemithorax, particularly in the lingula region. However, there is persistent retrocardiac opacity, which has progressed since the previous examination. Mild vascular engorgement is still present. The lines and tubes are unchanged, and there is no evidence of pneumothorax. Right basilar atelectasis has worsened since the last examination. 

The impression is that there is a slight improvement in the lingular atelectasis with persistent retrocardiac density, likely a combination of atelectasis and effusion. There is also a slight increase in right basal atelectasis with a probable adjacent small effusion. There is no significant interval change in mild vascular engorgement.",1
"HISTORY:  57-year-old male with subarachnoid hemorrhage, now intubated, referred for assessment of endotracheal tube position.  
COMPARISON:  Prior study from 1 hour and 50 minutes ago. ETT is positioned with the tip less than 2 cm above the carina. The heart size is within normal limits. The aorta appears unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. There are low lung volumes on the exam. There is bilateral basilar atelectasis. Opacity at the left lower lung field is likely atelectasis with adjacent small pleural effusion. No other significant abnormalities are seen. Comparison with prior study shows stable ETT position. Overall, the ETT is appropriately positioned, and no acute changes are noted.",1
"MRI OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT AND WITH GADOLINIUM 
Comparison is made with 5/22/08/ 
HISTORY:  Metastatic brain tumors.  
There is a postoperative cavity in the right frontal lobe with mild marginal enhancement. COMPARISON: 5/22/08
FINDINGS: MRI of the brain without and with gadolinium demonstrates a postoperative cavity in the right frontal lobe. The cavity shows mild marginal enhancement. No new or additional metastatic brain tumors are identified at this time.
IMPRESSION: Postoperative cavity in the right frontal lobe with mild marginal enhancement, consistent with the patient's history of metastatic brain tumors. No new or additional metastases identified on this study.",1
"INDICATIONS:  59-year-old man status post fall down the stairs, unresponsive and intubated.   Status post ET tube placement. There is no previous imaging available for comparison. The endotracheal tube is in good position. No pneumothorax or consolidations are present. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. The ventricles are normal in size and configuration without evidence of hydrocephalus. Multiple linear areas of increased signal intensity are seen within the brain parenchyma, consistent with shear injury or diffuse axonal injury. There is no evidence of acute spinal fracture or malalignment. No bony abnormalities or fractures are identified. 

IMPRESSION: 
1. Diffuse axonal injury in the brain parenchyma.
2. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
