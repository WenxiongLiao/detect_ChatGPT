"Analysis of alterations in the retinoblastoma gene and tumor grade in bone and soft-tissue sarcomas. We examined 43 sporadic bone and soft-tissue sarcomas for molecular genetic alterations affecting the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene Rb-1 (also known as RB1). The gene was altered in 6 of 14 sporadic osteosarcomas and in 5 of 29 other bone and soft-tissue sarcomas. Rb-1 messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts were detected in normal tissues and benign lipomas, but they were absent or altered in each of the 19 sarcomas we examined. To examine the association of deletions in the Rb-1 gene with tumor grade, we correlated the DNA alterations in the Rb-1 gene with clinical data for 36 patients. The Rb-1 gene was altered in 40% of high-grade bone and soft-tissue tumors, but not in low-grade bone tumors and in only one low-grade, soft-tissue sarcoma. Overall, 10 of 25 high-grade sarcomas had detectable alterations of the Rb-1 gene compared with only 1 of 11 low-grade tumors. ",0
"Bilateral sudden deafness and acute acquired toxoplasmosis. An 18-year-old woman, while suffering from acute acquired toxoplasmosis, experienced sudden deafness and a total loss of vestibular function first in the right ear and three months later also in the left. Following treatment with sulphadiazine and pyrimethamine, hearing was retrieved to such a degree that the patient was enabled to communicate by means of a body-worn hearing aid and lip-reading. Taking the differential diagnostic possibilities into account, we believe that toxoplasmosis was the cause of the severe hearing loss. Since effective treatment seems to be available, we recommend that patients with acute bilateral sensorineural hearing loss of unknown origin are examined for acute toxoplasmosis with a view to instituting chemotherapy.

"Mesial temporal sclerosis: pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management. Mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) is probably the most common symptomatic pathologic entity--alone or mixed with other pathologic features--for seizures of temporal lobe origin. The pathophysiology of MTS, including any genetic influence, needs clarification. A characteristic ictal expression for seizures of MTS origin appears not to exist. The majority of patients (78%) with postresection MTS who are seizure-free have tightly localized interictal abnormalities restricted to F7/F8, Sp1/Sp2, T3/T4, and T5/T6 more than 96% of the time. MRI abnormalities may be seen in 55% of patients with MTS if both ""hard"" and ""soft"" criteria are used or in 20% when only ""hard"" criteria are used. The neuropsychologic evaluation of patients with MTS, which includes intracarotid amobarbital test (IAT), may prove to be increasingly useful in identifying patterns of cognitive deficit that correlate with enhancement of both lateralizing and localizing preoperative information.

"Ischaemic heart disease among men in Norway during the period 1966-1985: two counties with different mortality time trends. We have examined regional differences in mortality from ischaemic heart disease, including sudden, unexpected death (IHD/SUD), among Norwegian men aged 30-69 years, during the period 1966-1985. Mortality time trends were considered. The two counties with the most widely differing IHD/SUD mortality time trends were Rogaland and Oppland. Rogaland, located in south-western Norway, experienced a 24.1% IHD/SUD mortality rate decrease between 1966-1970 and 1981-1985, while Oppland, in central south-eastern Norway, experienced a mortality rate increase of 12.4%. Marked regional differences within these counties were found. The highest IHD/SUD mortality rate increase occurred in rural areas of Oppland. Urban areas of Rogaland had sharply decreasing rates. Knowledge of such regional mortality differences could provide useful information regarding aetiological factors and serve as a basis for preventive measures and health-care planning. ",0
"Small cell carcinoma of the pancreas and biliary tract. Four cases of anaplastic carcinoma of the pancreas or biliary tract were studied clinicopathologically and immunohistochemically. All four cases were intermediate cell type and contained a minimum amount of microscopic foci of differentiated glandular adenocarcinoma. Argyrophilic tumor cells were not seen in any of the four tumors. Immunohistochemically, no tumor was positive for hormonal products, but all tumors were positive for epithelial markers. These findings suggest that the anaplastic carcinoma are not derived from argyrophilic cells, but rather from adenocarcinomas which have the potential for anaplastic metaplasia. The long-term survival of one patient emphasized the importance of chemotherapy in the treatment of small cell carcinoma of the pancreas and biliary tract. ",0
"Central odontogenic fibroma: clinicopathologic features of 19 cases and review of the literature. The odontogenic fibroma is a benign neoplasm infrequently reported in the literature (20 cases). Nineteen additional examples are reported. This lesion occurs most frequently in the maxilla anterior to the molars and displays a striking female predilection. On occasion, it may be associated with an unerupted mandibular third molar. Histomorphologically, it is not encapsulated. A spectrum of fibrous connective tissue stroma is present: from myxoid to densely hyalinized and from relatively acellular to cellular. Calcification may or may not be present. It is distinguished by the presence of sparse cords and islands of inactive odontogenic epithelium. Enucleation or surgical curettage is appropriate therapy and recurrence is low. As there appears to be no correlation of histologic pattern with clinical behavior, it seems unnecessary to try to separate the tumor into two variants. ",0
"Prevention of renal disease and conservation of renal function. In summary, we have reviewed some of the most frequently encountered areas of prevention of renal failure in the elderly. They include obstruction, hypertension, drug interaction, and inappropriate use of drugs and the silent killer of the elderly, renal carcinoma. Only by a thorough understanding of the altered physiology of the aging kidney can the physician avoid making the same mistakes when new drugs are developed or new types of diseases are encountered. Proper early diagnosis and understanding the guidelines to therapy in these conditions, can save huge human costs in terms of mortality, morbidity, and money. ",0
"Testicular calcifications and neoplasia in patient treated for subfertility. A subfertile male with a history of left cryptorchism underwent scrotal ultrasound that revealed stippled calcifications, without associated mass, in the right testicle. Six months later, while on a regimen of clomiphene citrate, a testicular tumor became palpable. This was sonographically confirmed to be surrounding the calcifications. Testicular calcifications are most commonly associated with benign conditions. We review the literature regarding their relationship to neoplasms and the significance of the ultrasonic findings. Furthermore, this is the sixth reported case of testicular tumor developing during hormonal treatment for oligospermia. Although these cases may be circumstantial, closer surveillance and screening ultrasound may be indicated for subfertile males taking clomiphene citrate. ",0
"Inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms. In a series of 517 operations for abdominal aortic aneurysm from 1971 to 1988 there were 45 cases (8.7%) with an inflammatory aneurysm with a typical thick glistening whitish fibrous layer. Almost two-third of the patients had rather severe chronic or acute progressive pain in the abdomen, the back or the flank. Unilateral (7) or bilateral (2) hydronephrosis due to ureteral compression occurred in 9 patients (20%). A diagnosis of inflammatory aneurysm was made preoperatively only in 10 patients. In 8 of the 9 patients with hydronephrosis ureterolysis was done, unilaterally (6) or bilaterally (2). After ureterolysis all had complete resolution of the hydronephrosis. Preoperative diagnostic methods are excretory urography, showing medial deviation, ultrasonography and CT-scanning of the abdominal aorta. All patients with an inflammatory aneurysm should undergo aortic replacement to prevent rupture and achieve pain relief. Ureterolysis in cases of hydronephrosis is strongly recommended and may be performed safely and with excellent results. ",0
"Lugol stain for intraoperative determination of the proximal surgical margin of the esophagus. An adequate proximal surgical margin is difficult to determine particularly in cases of esophageal carcinoma with surrounding intraepithelial invasion. We report here readily facilitated intraoperative approaches for detection of the exact margin of carcinomatous invasion of the esophagus. The resected specimen of the esophagus is incised longitudinally and placed in a 1% Lugol bath for 2-3 minutes. The normal squamous epithelium includes glycogen that interacts with the iodine of Lugol's solution and the normal epithelium of the esophagus becomes a uniform greenish-brown. A squamous cell carcinoma does not include glycogen, hence is not stained with this solution and a clear identification is feasible. Thus, a carcinomatous infiltration not recognizable in routine examinations becomes macroscopically visible when Lugol's solution is used. ",0
"Clinical judgments in pain management. From research reports published over the last 20 years, it appears that moderate to severe uncontrolled pain may be the norm for hospitalized patients despite recent advances in the management of pain. Research on the extent of under-management of pain and the factors associated with it is examined and summarized in this paper. Methodological imperfections of the research are identified. Several explanations for pain under-management have been proposed and these are reported. A clinical decision making model is also reviewed and it is suggested that this model could be applied to pain management problems. Further, it is suggested that this model may be very useful in developing educational interventions to improve health practitioners' clinical skills in pain management. ",0
"Germfree animals and technics in surgical research. Germfree animals have been reared to a size, weight, and age permitting the performance of major surgical procedures and the pursuit of a variety of surgical research problems. Germfree dogs have been maintained in the isolator system through three generations, indicating that life, reproduction, and growth are all possible in the absence of microbial contamination. The value of the germfree approach to surgical problems has been utilized in studies of a variety of gastrointestinal problems, shock, cancer, immunology, burns, wound healing, and in direct patient application. Patients have been maintained in isolator environments for prevention of infection, for operative procedures, for treatment of extensive burns, and for management of immune-suppressed individuals. We conclude that germfree animals and germfree technics provide a valuable addition to the armamentarium of the surgeon in both research and clinical applications. ",0
"Adverse treatment effects in the trial of the European Working Party on High Blood Pressure in the Elderly. Adverse treatment effects were assessed in 840 elderly hypertensive patients randomly assigned to active treatment (a combination of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide) or placebo; methyldopa was added to the regimen in one third of the treated patients. Symptoms of dry mouth, nasal stuffiness, and diarrhea were reported by significantly more treated patients than placebo control subjects. More patients receiving diuretics plus methyldopa than diuretics alone reported dry mouth and diarrhea. Significantly more treated patients than control subjects showed evidence of a high serum creatinine level, mild hypokalemia, and gout. More treated patients tended to have diabetes. The benefits of treatment outweighed these adverse treatment effects. ",0
"Corpus callosotomy for intractable seizures in the pediatric age group. The results of corpus callosotomy in 18 patients 16 years old and younger are presented. Eighty-three percent of our patients have had a significant improvement from the surgery (a decrease in seizure frequency of greater than 80% or no longer having generalized atonic, tonic, or tonic-clonic seizures). The procedure seems to be well tolerated in young patients, and we have not noted a postoperative deterioration in behavior, memory, or language function in our patients. One of our patients died in status epilepticus 3 months after surgery. Nevertheless, we have not encountered any serious morbidity in our other patients. Corpus callosotomy can be considered for children with intractable seizures, especially when generalized atonic, tonic, or tonic-clonic (whether primary or secondary) seizures are the major seizure type.

"Modified technique of Pringle's maneuver in resection of the liver. Crushing of the hepatic parenchyma with hepatic clamps to minimize blood loss during resection of the liver leads to mechanical damage of hepatocytes. Pringle's maneuver may precipitate liver failure by hepatic warm ischemia as well. Therefore, we controlled bleeding from the surface of the resection by using light compression on the hepatic parenchyma with a band while applying a hepatic arterial clamp at the hepatic hilus. This vascular control method can be done because the portal pressure is about one-tenth of the hepatic artery pressure and provides an efficient and harmless transection of the liver. ",0
"Prognostic factors in primary retroperitoneal soft-tissue sarcomas. We analyzed independent treatment variables (age, sex, signs and symptoms, site, size, histopathologic findings, grade, and clinical presentation) and treatment-dependent variables (resectability, type of operation, surgical margins, surgical boundaries, microscopic margins, adjuvant radiotherapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy) in 80 patients with primary retroperitoneal soft-tissue sarcomas admitted from 1982 through 1988. Both univariate and multivariate analysis of survival and disease-free survival were performed. The major factor in survival outcome was the ability to completely resect the lesion. When the 62 patients who underwent complete resection were examined, the only independent prognostic factor for both survival and disease-free survival was grade. We conclude that completeness of resection and grade of the lesion are primary determinants of survival. Once all tumor is macroscopically removed, no advantage could be demonstrated by more extensive surgical resection or current adjuvant therapy. ",0
"Surgery for thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. From July 1985 to July 1989, Loma Linda University Medical Center evaluated 46 thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs). Forty patients were taken to surgery--18 (45%) were operated on an emergency basis for reasons including rupture (12 patients, 30%), dissection (5 patients, 12.5%), and severe pain (1 patient). The overall mortality for all operated patients was five (12.5%-17% for emergency surgery versus 9% for elective surgery). Nonfatal complications occurred in 40 per cent of patients (16). The overall incidence of paraplegia was 10 per cent (4/40), emergency patients 17 per cent (3/18) versus elective patients 4.5 per cent (1/22). Careful preoperative evaluation, standardization of operative technique, and good postoperative management have improved the outlook for these patients who otherwise would progress to eventual rupture and death. Because mortality and morbidity are substantially reduced in elective patients, we recommend that all patients with TAAAs be evaluated for surgery as soon as diagnosis is made. ",0
"Intracatheter streptokinase for recurrent peritonitis in CAPD. Intracatheter streptokinase (SK) is advocated as effective treatment with minimal adverse effects in both recurrent bacterial peritonitis and catheter fibrin blockage in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. We reviewed 35 instillations in 20 patients noting a high (86%) side effect profile consisting of fever, onset of turbid dialysis effluent and/or abdominal pain. SK probably releases fibrin clot containing bacteria, leukocytes and debris from the colonized catheter into the peritoneal cavity causing a ""peritonitis-like syndrome"" of 1 to 3 days duration. Fungal peritonitis occurred after SK in 2 patients. Failure of SK therapy was encountered in Staphylococcus epidermidis infection (p less than 0.05 versus other organisms), which may be related to its protective capsular polysaccharide slime and ability to adhere to plastic prosthetic devices. SK, in this study, was useful treatment in relapsing bacterial peritonitis (50% overall cure) but failed to correct catheter malfunction. ",0
"The value of indium 111 leukocyte scanning in the evaluation of painful or infected total knee arthroplasties. Evaluation of painful total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) for infection can be difficult. Indium 111 (111In) leukocyte bone scanning provides a minimally invasive technique for evaluation of possible infection. Thirty-eight patients with a painful TKA who had surgical exploration after 111In leukocyte scanning were reviewed. The scan had an accuracy of 84%, a sensitivity of 83%, and a specificity of 85%. The 111In leukocyte scans must be interpreted in conjunction with the clinical evaluation of the patient because they are less accurate for study of TKAs than of total hip arthroplasties. ",0
"Ultrasound and ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy of supraclavicular lymph nodes in patients with esophageal carcinoma. The use of ultrasound combined with ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (UGFAB) of supraclavicular lymph nodes in the pretreatment staging of 37 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus is described. All patients underwent computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest and the abdomen and ultrasound of the abdomen and supraclavicular regions. Supraclavicular lymph node metastases (Stage IV disease according to the tumor nodes metastasis [TNM] classification) were cytologically diagnosed in seven (18.9%) of the 37 patients. In two of these patients, no other metastases were found. In the other five patients, UGFAB replaced more invasive diagnostic procedures. Due to their superficial location, ultrasound and UGFAB of the supraclavicular lymph nodes was relatively simple to perform, and contributed to an improved staging of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus.

"A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of oral antibiotic therapy following intravenous antibiotic therapy for postpartum endometritis. One hundred thirty-six patients were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of oral antibiotic therapy (amoxicillin) versus placebo following successful intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy for postpartum endometritis. No subjects were readmitted to the hospital for recurrent endometritis and there were no wound infections or recurrent fevers. Minor side effects were seen in 10% of those taking amoxicillin and 14% of those taking placebo. Compliance was fair; only 52% of those taking amoxicillin and 65% of those taking placebo completed therapy. The lack of infectious complications in this high-risk population suggests that oral antibiotic therapy is unnecessary after successful IV antibiotic therapy for endometritis. ",0
"Slowly progressive aphasia: three cases with language, memory, CT and PET data. Three cases of slowly progressive speech and language disturbance were studied at various points post onset (three, five and 15 years respectively). Language, neuropsychological and brain imaging (computer tomography and positron emission tomography) evaluations were completed on all three patients. The data suggest that the syndrome of ""progressive aphasia"": 1) does not involve a uniform symptom complex; 2) does not necessarily develop into a full blown dementia syndrome; 3) varies greatly in rate of progression from case to case; 4) is associated with normal brain structure (on computer tomography); and 5) is associated with abnormal left temporal lobe metabolism as measured by fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET). One patient had histological findings consistent with Alzheimer's disease at necropsy. ",0
"Visual evoked potential monitoring of optic nerve function during surgery. A study was made with intra-operative flash--visual evoked potentials (VEP) monitored using a fibre-optic/contact lens photo stimulator in 57 patients undergoing intra-orbital surgical procedures with potential risk to the optic nerve. The VEPs recorded under enflurane and nitrous oxide anaesthesia did not differ significantly in latency or amplitude from the pre-operative recordings. Transient abolition of the VEP was seen under many circumstances and did not correlate with the outcome of surgery, but absence of a previously normal VEP for more than four minutes during surgical manipulation within the orbit did show a correlation with post operative impairment of vision. The technique provides early warning to the surgeon of threats to the integrity of the optic nerve. ",0
"Protein phosphorylation during ischemia. Many investigations have shown that calcium and adenosine triphosphate are crucial to central nervous system functions. It is probable that alterations of these substances during central nervous system ischemia are involved in the processes that cause irreversible neural damage. Calcium regulates several protein kinases that are responsible for phosphorylation of proteins vital for many central nervous system functions. Using a rabbit spinal cord ischemia model, we found protein kinase C and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase were severely affected during the first hour of ischemia. Protein kinase A was not significantly affected. The time course of lost protein kinase C enzyme activity closely corresponded to irreversible loss of neurologic function, and there is evidence that protein kinase C inhibitor activity is generated. Also, drugs that inhibit protein kinase C increased neurologic damage when administered during the early phases of ischemia. These results suggest that protein phosphorylation, particularly by protein kinase C, is critical to maintenance of neurologic function. ",0
"Surgical therapy of the eyelids in patients with facial paralysis. Patients with facial paralysis have a degree of lagophthalmos and paralytic ectropion. We present our experience in the surgical management of 25 consecutive patients treated for these problems. Paralytic lagophthalmos was corrected using gold weights inserted into the upper eyelid. The advantages and disadvantages of this surgical technique are reviewed. Medial canthoplasty and lateral canthoplasty were performed to rectify paralytic ectropion. Ancillary procedures included browpexy, upper-lid blepharoplasty, and temporalis sling. The results were excellent in 23 of 25 patients and good in the remaining two. After a minimum of 6 months' follow-up, there were no complications. The authors believe that the above procedures will yield consistently excellent cosmetic and functional results in patients with paralysis of the eyelids. ",0
"Clinical outcome of emergency repeat coronary artery bypass surgery. To determine the clinical outcome of patients requiring emergency repeat coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedures, we reviewed 23 such procedures performed for ongoing myocardial ischemia refractory to medical management. The operative mortality was 17%. On follow-up, an average of 24.9 months after emergency reoperation, 14 of the 19 survivors (74%) had recurrent angina. As compared to a randomly selected group of 25 patients who underwent elective repeat CABG procedures during the same time period, the incidence of late cardiac events was significantly higher (79% in the emergency group, 30% in the elective surgery group) and fewer patients had received internal mammary artery (IMA) grafts (9% vs 52%). Emergency repeat CABG operations have considerable operative mortality and poor postoperative functional results with the majority of survivors developing recurrent ischemic syndromes within a short period of time.

"Clinical results of axillobifemoral bypass using externally supported polytetrafluoroethylene Seventy-six axillobifemoral grafts with externally supported polytetrafluoroethylene prostheses were performed since 1983. The indications for operation were absolute (aortic sepsis) in 20 (26%) patients and relative (excessive operative risk or technical difficulty) in 56 (74%) patients. The life-table primary patency for these operations at 4 years follow-up (mean follow-up, 2 years, 4 months) was 85%. We conclude that the patency results achieved in this patient series are sufficiently satisfactory to warrant use of axillobifemoral grafts in an expanded number of patients with high operative risk and need for bypass of aortoiliac occlusive disease.

"Asymptomatic rhabdomyolysis of unknown etiology. A 7-year-old boy developed rhabdomyolysis with a peak creatine phosphokinase level of 261,400 IU/L after his appendectomy. These abnormalities occurred following a 2-3-day illness consisting of upper respiratory tract symptoms, fever, and abdominal pain mimicking acute appendicitis. At the time of operation, a normal appendix was removed, and mesenteric lymphadenitis was noted. The myoglobinuria and elevation of creatine phosphokinase were transient, and the patient remained asymptomatic. We review various causes of right lower quadrant pain and rhabdomyolysis and address the roles of malignant hyperthermia and infectious agents. The possible cause of the phenomena observed in this patient is discussed. ",0
"The cellular biology of bone tumors. New knowledge in cell and molecular biology has begun to expand the understanding of the biology of osteosarcoma and Ewing's sarcoma. Studies on osteosarcomas have revealed abnormalities in the growth-inhibiting retinoblastoma gene, which may release cells from normal growth control. Abnormalities in growth factor production or response tend to inappropriately activate cell growth. Tumor cell DNA content and cytogenetics may affect the diagnosis and prognostic grouping of osteosarcomas. In Ewing's sarcomas, a characteristic translocation between Chromosomes 11 and 22 has been identified; this translocation is also found in malignant neuroepitheliomas. A variety of studies point to both neuroectodermal and mesenchymal origins for Ewing's sarcomas. Applications of new biologic knowledge and technology to clinical problems will lead to significant changes in the diagnosis, and perhaps in the treatment, of these tumors in the coming years. Collaborations between community and referral center physicians and scientists are critical for continued progress. ",0
"Selective peripheral denervation for torticollis: preliminary results Herein we report the preliminary results in nine patients who have undergone selective peripheral denervation for spasmodic torticollis and have been followed up for at least 13 months. All patients had improvement immediately after surgical intervention, and the results have been maintained in five patients. In one patient who had recurrent torticollis, a second procedure in conjunction with injection of botulinum toxin has produced substantial improvement; however, follow-up was brief (6 months). No surgical complications occurred. We believe that selective peripheral denervation is safe and that it can benefit patients with torticollis who have not responded to other types of therapy. These favorable results confirm other published reports on the efficacy of selective peripheral denervation. Long-term follow-up, however, is necessary for determining the role of this procedure in the management of torticollis. ",0
"Postoperative hypertension: a prospective, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind trial, with intravenous nicardipine hydrochloride. Nicardipine hydrochloride, a new calcium channel blocker for intravenous use, has been compared with placebo in a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial on postoperative hypertension. Of 175 patients who signed preoperative consent, 24 (13.7%) met entry criteria. Hypertension was significantly better controlled in nicardipine-treated patients compared with those receiving placebo (93% versus 30%, p less than 0.05). All the placebo failures were subsequently successfully treated with nicardipine. There were no significant complications in either group. The authors conclude that nicardipine HC1 is an effective, safe therapy for postoperative hypertension. Further studies are now indicated comparing it with other drugs currently used to treat this condition. ",0
"Stroke recurrence within 2 years after ischemic infarction. We prospectively studied stroke recurrence in 1,273 patients with ischemic stroke who were entered into the Stroke Data Bank. Median follow-up was 13 months. The 2-year cumulative recurrence rate among these patients was 14.1%. Age, sex, race, history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, or transient ischemic attacks, and stroke location were not associated with a higher risk of stroke recurrence. Patients with an elevated blood pressure, an abnormal initial computed tomogram, or a history of diabetes mellitus were at a higher risk of stroke recurrence. In contrast, patients with an infarct of unknown cause were at a lower risk of stroke recurrence than patients with a defined stroke mechanism, such as lacune, embolism, or atherosclerosis. A multivariate model suggests that patients at the lowest risk for stroke recurrence have a low diastolic blood pressure, no history of stroke, no history of diabetes mellitus, and an infarct of unknown cause.

"Reconstruction of mandibular defects in irradiated patients. In this prospective study, mandibular reconstruction using titanium plates was evaluated in 31 patients treated between July 1988 and January 1990. Sixteen patients had prior surgery; 13 had prior radiotherapy. In 11 patients, prior radiation and surgery had failed. Sixteen patients received postoperative radiotherapy either in standard or accelerated fractions. Twelve patients had complications of either intraoral (8), extraoral (5), or combined (1) plate exposure or fistula formation (2). Factors significantly related to complications were poor nutrition, accelerated radiation, and recurrence. Sixty-one percent of all patients healed uneventfully. When patients with complications secondary to recurrence who subsequently died were excluded, the success rate was 73%. Only one patient had an unacceptable result that produced a cosmetic and functional deformity despite secondary repair. ",0
"Angina, ischemia, and effort tolerance with vasodilating beta-blockers. beta-Blockers are known to suppress exercise-induced ischemia but give rise to such problems as fatigue or dyspnea on effort and also bradycardia. In a series of double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of celiprolol (a cardioselective beta 1-blocker with beta 2-agonist and vasodilatory properties) in patients with hypertension and angina and in normal volunteers, it was found that celiprolol did not produce bradycardia when given in combination with verapamil. Celiprolol did reduce exercise-induced ischemia, but there was no reduction in cardiac output at rest or on exercise compared with placebo. Compared with atenolol, celiprolol produced less dyspnea and fatigue at submaximal levels of exercise. It is concluded that celiprolol possesses certain differences, compared with conventional beta-blockers, that may be of direct clinical benefit. ",0
"Strokes in African-Americans. Hypertension is the most important risk factor for stroke, especially in African-Americans. Improved control of high blood pressure nationwide is a key factor in the recent dramatic decline in stroke frequency, most notably in African-American women. Hypertension control programs must be adequately funded and expanded. African-Americans have a disproportionately high incidence of risk factors for stroke, including hypertension. There is evidence that the cerebral vessels involved in ischemic stroke in African-Americans may differ from those of Caucasians. There is an urgent need for more research on stroke in general, risk factor relations in particular, and mechanisms in the pathogenesis of stroke in African-Americans. ",0
"Does age affect outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation? We examined the relation between age and outcomes in patients treated for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Seattle, Wash. Considering all out-of-hospital cardiac arrests treated by paramedics over a recent 5-year period, 386 (27%) of 1405 consecutive patients aged 70 years or older were resuscitated and admitted to a hospital vs 474 (29%) of 1624 younger patients; 140 elderly patients (10%) were discharged alive vs 223 younger patients (14%). Of the 140 elderly patients, 112 went home and 28 went to a nursing home. Considering only patients whose initial rhythms were ventricular fibrillation, the percent of patients discharged alive was substantially higher: 120 (24%) of 493 for elderly patients and 194 (30%) of 639 for younger patients. Elderly patients can benefit from attempted resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. ",0
"Surgical treatment of aneurysm or dissection involving the ascending aorta and aortic arch, utilizing circulatory arrest and retrograde cerebral perfusion. Recently we replaced the ascending aorta and aortic arch in 8 patients with aneurysm or dissection, using profound hypothermic circulatory arrest with retrograde cerebral perfusion. There were no operative deaths. Open aortic anastomosis facilitated repair of the aortic arch without clamping the arch tributaries, and embolism due to particulate debris from clamping of the arch vessels was eliminated. Retrograde cerebral perfusion during profound hypothermic circulatory arrest is a simplified technique that may protect the brain. This method offers advantages over previously described methods, particularly in obviating dissection of the arch tributaries and the clamping thereof, and in protecting the central nervous system.

"Matched group study of surgical resection versus cobalt-60 plaque radiotherapy for primary choroidal or ciliary body melanoma. We report the results of a nonrandomized, matched-group, survival and visual preservation study of patients with a choroidal or ciliary body melanoma managed by microsurgical resection of the tumor versus cobalt-60 episcleral plaque radiotherapy. Each treatment group consisted of 30 patients. All patients were matched on a case-by-case basis in terms of tumor size (largest linear tumor dimension), location of the anterior tumor margin relative to the ora serrata, location of the posterior tumor margin relative to the equator, and age at the time of treatment. Although the estimated actuarial 5-year survival probability was slightly greater in the resection group (85.2%) than in the cobalt plaque group (81.8%), this difference was neither clinically impressive nor statistically significant. In contrast, there was a substantially higher rate of early posttreatment severe visual loss in the resection group (P = .0008, Mantel-Haenszel test). ",0
"Primary lymphoma of the central nervous system in two children with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Postmortem examination disclosed central nervous system non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in two children who died of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) at 6 and 14 months of age, respectively. Systemic signs of lymphoma were not present. The B-cell origin and clonality of the neoplastic cells were established by immunohistochemistry in one case and by molecular analysis of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement in the other. Moreover, in the latter case the neoplastic cells were characterized by the presence of a single episomal EBV genome. According to these data, the monoclonal B-cell proliferation occurred after EBV infection, thus suggesting a possible pathogenetic role of EBV in the early stages of lymphomagenesis. ",0
"Wrist flexion as an adjunct to the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome. The effects of five minutes of wrist flexion on median motor and sensory evoked potential latencies in 87 individuals were studied. Nineteen subjects had carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) as diagnosed by increased median nerve latencies across the wrist, and 68 had values in the normal range and were assigned to the control group. A slight prolongation of up to 0.5m sec of evoked potential latencies was observed in both groups after flexion, but the differences between the two groups were not significant to establish the value of adding wrist flexion to conventional screening methods.

"Critical review of gangliosides and thyrotropin-releasing hormone in peripheral neuromuscular diseases. The lack of effective therapy for many of the chronic neuromuscular diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, hereditary motor sensory neuropathy (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease), spinocerebellar degenerations and idiopathic polyneuropathy has led to a search for substances that may stimulate peripheral nerve regeneration. Two such agents that have been proposed are gangliosides (mixed purified bovine brain gangliosides, Cronassial) and thyrotropin releasing factor (TRH). Studies on both of these agents were initially reported with enthusiasm to be successful, but later double-blind controlled studies have failed to confirm these findings. This review provides critical analysis of the designs of studies of potentially effective agents in chronic neuromuscular diseases, and emphasizes the power of the placebo response, and the importance of designing placebos which are indistinguishable from the trial medication other than in the active effect.

"Primary defect in alpha-adrenergic responsiveness in patients with varicose veins. Responsiveness of superficial hand veins to local infusions of noradrenaline was compared in patients with primary varicose veins and in healthy volunteers by use of the dorsal hand vein technique. Patients with varicose veins required significantly higher doses of noradrenaline for half-maximal venoconstriction than the dose required by control subjects (geometric mean, 11.6 ng/min in patients compared with 4.8 ng/min in control subjects; p = 0.006). Noradrenaline responsiveness in varicose veins was not significantly different from hand vein responsiveness in the same patients. Our findings indicate a constitutional decrease in venous alpha-adrenergic receptor responsiveness in patients with varicosities. Dilation of varicose veins does not further affect noradrenaline-induced venoconstriction. ",0
"Immunohistochemical demonstration of pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor in normal and neoplastic colonic mucosa. Specimens of normal and neoplastic colonic mucosa from 52 patients were analysed by immunohistochemistry using a monospecific polyclonal antiserum against human pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (PSTI). In normal colonic mucosa PSTI was found in the goblet cells in the basal parts of the crypts. In adenomas of tubular, villous, and tubulo-villous types PSTI was also found in the upper parts of the polyps, usually occurring in the regeneration zone. There was a more intense staining reaction in polyps with increased atypia. Carcinomas of different types and of various grades of differentiation and of in situ type did not contain PSTI. These findings indicate that PSTI could be a marker for adenomatous rather than carcinomatous epithelium in the colon. Furthermore, the absence of the inhibitor in malignant cells might facilitate tissue invasion by malignant cells because of deficient protease inhibition. ",0
"Skeletal muscle depressed calcium and phosphofructokinase in chronic heart failure are upregulated by captopril--a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, after treatment for 5-6 weeks with 25 mg t.i.d., were studied in 12 patients with stable moderate heart failure. Five patients received placebo treatment, and the two groups were comparable at baseline. Angiotensin II levels decreased in response to captopril therapy. Skeletal muscle potassium, magnesium and chloride levels did not differ from reference values. Calcium was subnormal (P less than 0.0001), but increased to the reference range during captopril treatment. Phosphofructokinase, a rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme, was in the lower reference range and increased (P less than 0.04) in response to captopril therapy. In conclusion, stable moderate heart failure is associated with low levels of skeletal muscle calcium and phosphofructokinase activity, these metabolic changes tending to return to normal levels with captopril treatment.

"Hemodynamic and endocrine effects of mental stress in untreated borderline hypertension. Mental arithmetic and mirror tracing were compared in 40 untreated patients with borderline hypertension, tested in random sequence in standardized protocols. Both tasks significantly increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac index, plasma renin, and decreased peripheral resistance. Mental arithmetic also increased cholesterol, triglycerides and HDL; plasma catecholamines were not changed significantly. Lipid changes were correlated with blood pressure changes. These methods will be useful in exploring the relationships between hemodynamic reactivity to stress, and the presence and progression of atherosclerosis, as well as testing the effects of antihypertensive drugs on stress-induced changes that may influence atherosclerotic complications of hypertension.

"Recombination between two 14-bp homologous sequences as the mechanism for gene deletion in factor IX Seattle 1. Factor IXSeattle 1 is a 10-kb intragenic deletion identified in a family that has hemophilia B. By sequencing across the site of the deletion, we discovered at the deletion junction a 13-bp sequence (5' . . . TAGAA-GTTCACTT . . . 3') that was homologous to two 14-bp sequences 10 kb apart in introns D and F of the normal factor IX gene. The presence of these homologous sequences in two different regions of the normal gene allows us to propose that genetic recombination has occurred between the sequences, resulting in the gene deletion. The precise recombination site was able to be localized to one of 5 bp (5' . . . AGTTC . . . 3') in the middle of the homologous sequences. The exact length of the deletion is 10,000 bp. ",0
"Pleuropulmonary manifestations of hepatic amebiasis Pleuropulmonary manifestations of hepatic amebiasis occurred in 30 patients; 18 (60%) presented with at least 1 pulmonary complaint and 10 (33%) had multiple pulmonary symptoms. In 14 patients (47%), abnormalities were found on examination of the chest. In 16 chest roentgenograms (53%), there was at least 1 abnormality: right-sided pleural effusion (9 patients) and elevated right hemidiaphragm (8 patients) were the most common. All patients were treated with metronidazole (Flagyl) and had resolution of the amebic liver abscess and pulmonary disease. Pleuropulmonary disease is a common complication of amebic liver abscess. The clinical presentation and chest roentgenograms are virtually diagnostic and obviate the need for invasive procedures to confirm the diagnosis. Pleuropulmonary disease resolves with amebicidal treatment of the hepatic abscess. ",0
"The presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) in solitary adult laryngeal papillomas demonstrated by in-situ DNA hybridization with sulphonated probes. Human papilloma virus (HPV) types 6 and 11 have been repeatedly demonstrated in multiple laryngeal papillomas, and there is little doubt that these lesions are caused by HPV. It has been clearly demonstrated in recent reports that the clinical course of solitary adult onset laryngeal papillomas is entirely different from that of multiple papillomas of juvenile as well as of adult onset. We here report the presence of HPV types 6 and 11 in 19 out of 20 solitary papillomas from 16 patients, while HPV types 16 and 18 were totally absent. We conclude that the milder clinical course in such patients is most likely to be due to host factors, rather than to viral factors. ",0
"Serological evidence of infection with Helicobacter pylori may predict gastrointestinal intolerance to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) treatment in rheumatoid arthritis. Specific circulating antibodies to the spiral gastric organism, Helicobacter pylori (HP) were detectable in 43% of 68 patients with rheumatoid arthritis by complement fixation test (CFT) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), a frequency comparable with that of a normal, age-matched population. Presence of these antibodies correlated strongly with a previous history of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and to the severity of NSAID-related dyspeptic symptoms, the latter often leading to multiple drug intolerance. This contrasts with short term, prospective NSAID toxicity data, which show little relationship between ulceration and HP carriage. This result suggests, however, that HP may have a definite role in the pathogenesis of symptomatic PUD associated with more chronic NSAID usage, and may have important implications for ulcer prophylaxis in these patients.

"Polyamine levels in healthy and tumor tissues of patients with colon adenocarcinoma. Tissue polyamine levels were determined in patients with colon adenocarcinoma to try to identify biochemical indicators able to characterize the growth and the metabolism of human solid tumors. Polyamine content was determined in the tumor and in the ""healthy"" mucosa sampled at different distances within the resection edges. For each patient the polyamine content in the tumor was compared with that in the mucosa. The results demonstrated that the spermidine concentration was higher in the tumor than in the healthy mucosa; the differences were statistically significant. However, spermine in the tumor increased to a lesser degree. No statistically significant differences were observed among these mucosae at different localizations, but the spermine concentration in the mucosa after the tumor showed values very close to those of the neoplasia.

"HLA class I and class II antigen expression on squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. We compared human major histocompatibility (HLA) class I and class II antigen expression on squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with that on normal mucosa. Frozen sections of a consecutive series of 30 squamous cell carcinomas were stained with the monoclonal antibodies W6/32 (class I) and anti-DR (class II) using an immunoperoxidase technique. Normal mucosa showed class I and class II expression in the basal layers only. Class I expression on tumors was diffuse in 87%, patchy in 10%, and scattered in 3%. Class II expression on tumors was diffuse in 20%, patchy in 53%, scattered in 20%, and absent in 7%. Patterns of expression did not correlate significantly with clinical parameters, including survival, except that class II diffuse and patchy patterns were found to correlate with more poorly differentiated tumors.

"Denervation in hemiplegic muscles. This study examined the frequency of denervation activity in hemiplegic muscles in relation to the size and location of the central lesion. We studied 20 patients, 14 with major unilateral cerebral infarctions in the middle cerebral or internal carotid territories; four with a single lacune in the pons, internal capsule, or thalamus; and two with precentral infarcts. Using somatosensory evoked potentials, motor conduction studies, and assessments of conduction across the plexus and roots, we detected no conduction abnormalities on the affected side. Fibrillation was common in both groups, especially in distal and intermediate muscles. The distribution of the fibrillation and the normal conduction studies suggested that trauma of peripheral nerves was not a factor. Although the normal conduction studies and pattern of fibrillation activity do not exclude peripheral nerve trauma as the cause of the fibrillation, we suggest that transsynaptic degeneration is a reasonable alternative explanation.

"Systemic hypertension in sleep apnea syndrome. Relationship with sleep architecture and breathing abnormalities. To examine the possible relationship between systemic HT and SAS we compared 21 hypertensive (HT+) and 29 normotensive (HT-) patients for morphologic characteristics, sleep disturbances and respiratory events monitored during a full night polysomnography. There was no significant difference between HT+ and HT- patients with respect to age, weight, BMI, sleep stage distribution and disorganization, apnea-hypopnea index (number of episodes per hour of sleep) and duration (minutes per hour of sleep) nor O2 saturation indices: mean nocturnal and minimum O2 saturation. We conclude therefore that HT in SAS patients is not directly related to morphologic characteristics, sleep disturbances and breathing abnormalities. ",0
"Nucleolar organizer regions in precancerous and cancerous lesions of the bronchus. Using a silver staining technique, nucleolar organizer region-associated proteins (Ag-NOR) were studied in paraffin sections of five specimens of normal bronchial epithelium, eight of atypical squamous metaplasia, five of carcinoma in situ, and seven of microinvasive squamous cell carcinoma. The mean number of Ag-NOR in the nucleus were normal epithelium 1.2 +/- 0.1 (mean +/- SD), atypical squamous metaplasia (borderline lesion) 2.2 +/- 0.5, carcinoma in situ 3.8 +/- 0.6, and microinvasive squamous cell carcinoma 4.8 +/- 1.1. There was a highly significant difference between the Ag-NOR numbers in the atypical squamous metaplasia and those in the carcinoma in situ (P less than 0.01). The Ag-NOR staining is a useful technique for the differential diagnosis of difficult borderline lesions in the bronchial epithelium. ",0
"Development of language in six hemispherectomized patients. The development of language skills in the isolated right hemisphere was investigated by comparing the performance of 3 left hemispherectomized with that of the 3 right hemispherectomized patients and three groups of control subjects on baseline clinical measures of language and on production and judgement of morphological markers. The initial brain insult in the hemispherectomy patients of each group had occurred either during early, middle or late childhood. The left hemispherectomy patients were severely impaired in language processing across all three stages of language development. The consequences of a right hemisphere insult on language development were more restricted, with deleterious effects being apparent only in the case in which the lesion was acquired during early childhood.

"Prevalence of common and dysplastic naevi in a Swedish population. The naevus profile was examined in a Swedish population that was randomly selected from a census file. The participation rate was considered high at 82%. The number of common naevi (CN) and the prevalence of dysplastic naevi (DN) were investigated in 379 subjects (aged 30-50 years). The mean total body count of CN greater than or equal to 2 mm was 67 (range 1-300). As many as 22% of the population had 100 naevi or more and only 18% had less than 25. The counts were not influenced by age or sex. DN were diagnosed clinically in 18% (CI 14-22%) of the subjects and histologically in 8% (CI 5-11%). Subjects with dysplastic naevi had a significantly larger number of common naevi and a more sun-sensitive skin type than subjects without DN, P less than 0.001. ",0
"Effects of anticonvulsant treatment and low levels of folate and thiamine on amine metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid. A total of 157 epileptic patients were studied with respect to (1) biogenic amine precursors and metabolites in the CSF, (2) levels of folate and thiamine in the blood and CSF, (3) length of treatment with phenytoin (PHT), (4) PHT intoxication, (5) CNS atrophy. Alterations in CSF amine metabolite levels were related primarily to PHT intoxication, and low CSF folate and thiamine levels, but not to length of treatment or CNS atrophy. PHT intoxication increased CSF 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5HIAA). Low folate levels were associated with decreased CSF 5HIAA and homovanillic acid, while low thiamine levels were associated with decreased CSF 5HIAA and 3-methyoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethylene glycol. It remains to be seen to what extent these alterations in biogenic amine metabolism, mediated by low CNS vitamin levels, also lead to deficits in cerebral function. ",0
"Management of mycotic rupture of the ascending aorta after heart-lung transplantation. A 19-year-old woman underwent heart-lung transplantation for obstructive bronchiolitis. Eleven days later mycotic rupture of the ascending aorta occurred. Emergency cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted via the femoral vessels and the chest was reopened under cardiac massage. Perforation of the aorta at the site of insertion of the cardioplegic cannula in the donor aorta was seen. Under circulatory arrest the infected area was excised, a pericardial patch plasty was performed, and the region was covered with a muscle flap. Postoperatively, Candida albicans was found in the excised specimen of the aorta, in drainage fluid, and in the bronchoalveolar lavage. High doses of antimycotics were administered intravenously and for irrigation of the mediastinum, which resulted in an eradication of fungi in all cultures 7 days later. Six weeks after reoperation the patient was discharged home, and she remains well 9 months postoperatively. ",0
"Degenerative aortic stenosis. One effect of the graying of America. Degenerative calcific aortic stenosis is evolving as a common geriatric problem. Once symptoms develop, it is a highly lethal disease that does not respond well to medical therapy. Aortic balloon valvuloplasty may offer palliation but is unlikely to alter the overall course of the disease. Aortic valve replacement is the therapy of choice, but high perioperative morbidity and mortality rates can be expected in the very elderly. The presence of other appreciable cardiac disorders may contribute to the occurrence of postoperative complications. Patients with asymptomatic aortic stenosis and normal left ventricular function can be treated medically and followed with serial aortic valve area determinations using Doppler echocardiography. ",0
"Perianal appearances associated with constipation. The perianal appearances were studied prospectively of 136 constipated children (mean age 3.9 years, 67 boys, 69 girls). Anal dilatation, fissures, tags, warts, perianal oedema, redness, blueness, and veins were recorded. It was noted whether dilatation occurred immediately or at 30 and 60 seconds with the buttocks minimally separated, and on subsequent firm lateral traction of the buttocks. The degree of faecal loading was assessed in all children. Anal dilatation was found in 24 (18%) and first appeared on lateral traction in eight (6%). In three quarters of the children with dilatation faecal loading or perianal signs were present. Fissures were found in 35 (26%) children and tags in seven (5%). Perianal redness was more likely to be associated with fissures, and blueness with dilatation. We conclude that there are no pathognomonic perianal signs in childhood constipation and that the technique of anal examination should be standardised. ",0
"Delayed positive gastrointestinal bleeding studies with technetium-99m-red blood cells: utility of a second injection. Two patients studied with technetium-99m-labeled red blood cells (RBCs) for gastrointestinal bleeding had positive findings only on 24-hr delayed images, at which time the site of bleeding could not be ascertained. In each instance, when additional delayed images suggested that active bleeding was occurring, a second aliquot of RBCs was labeled and injected. Sites of active hemorrhage were identified following further imaging in both patients. When delayed GI bleeding images are positive, further views should be obtained to ascertain if the pattern of intraluminal activity changes. If renewed active hemorrhage is suspected, reinjection with a second dose of labeled RBCs may identify the bleeding site. ",0
"Performing screening flexible sigmoidoscopy using colonoscopes: experience in 500 subjects. There is still controversy regarding the optimal length of flexible sigmoidoscopes. We performed screening distal colon examinations using 168-cm colonoscopes in 500 asymptomatic subjects who were unsedated and had sigmoidoscopy cleansing preparation. The mean depth of penetration was 66 cm and was similar in persons in whom the examination was discontinued because of poor preparation versus those with discomfort. Polyps were detected in 87 patients, but only 5 subjects had polyps detected above 60 cm. We conclude that in a group of unsedated subjects scheduled for flexible sigmoidoscopy after a sigmoidoscopy prep, the use of instruments longer than 60 cm gives very little additional yield. ",0
"Hashimoto's encephalopathy: a steroid-responsive disorder associated with high anti-thyroid antibody titers--report of 5 cases. We describe 5 patients with a relapsing encephalopathy in association with Hashimoto's disease and high titers of anti-thyroid antibodies. The presentation is usually with a subacute onset of confusion, alteration in conscious level, and focal or generalized seizures. The relapsing course, association with myoclonus or tremulousness, and episodes of stroke-like deterioration are characteristic features. The long-term prognosis is favorable with steroid therapy, though additional immunosuppressive therapy may be required. Neurologic investigation typically shows a diffusely abnormal EEG, high CSF protein level without pleocytosis, and normal brain CT and cerebral angiogram. Isotope brain scan may show patchy abnormal uptake. Hashimoto's encephalopathy should be recognized as a definite neurologic entity and added to the list of CNS complications of thyroid disease. ",0
"The gonadotropin-releasing hormone associated peptide reduces calcium entry in prolactin-secreting cells. The precursor molecule to the GnRH contains a peptide named GnRH-associated peptide (GAP) with PRL-inhibiting properties. In this work, we have studied the electrophysiological properties and responses to GAP of three different types of PRL-secreting cells: 1) the rat tumor cell line GH3, 2) normal rat pituitary cells in primary culture, and 3) human PRL-secreting adenoma cells. Using different but complementary techniques we show that GAP reduces intracellular Ca++ levels, [Ca++]i, and inhibits Ca++ transients in these cells. This reduction of [Ca++]i results from coordinate actions of GAP on K+ and Ca++ conductances and may explain the inhibitory effect of GAP on hormonal secretion by PRL-secreting cells. ",0
"The role of endoscopic injection sclerotherapy in the management of bleeding peristomal varices. Peristomal varices usually occur in patients with enterostomies who develop portal hypertension, and represent a cause of recurrent or intractable gastrointestinal bleeding. Treatment options for such bleeding include surgical ligation of varices, stoma revision with devascularization, injection sclerotherapy, portacaval shunt, or liver transplantation. We reviewed the records of seven patients with peristomal varices, who were followed for a mean of 17 months after diagnosis. Fourteen episodes of clinically significant peristomal bleeding occurred in six patients. Surgical ligation of varices was ineffective in controlling bleeding in two of three patients, although stoma revision with devascularization was temporarily effective in two other patients. Injection sclerotherapy, used in three patients, effectively controlled acute bleeding without serious complications or need for surgery. Definitive treatment for peristomal bleeding (portacaval shunt or liver transplantation) has prevented any further bleeding in three patients for a mean of 8 months after surgery. ",0
"Multiple-pulse stimulation and dantrolene in malignant hyperthermia. A potentially fatal condition, yet preventable, malignant hyperthermia (MH) lacks a satisfactory noninvasive diagnostic test. Studying the effects of intravenous dantrolene (3 mg/kg) on electrically stimulated skeletal muscle, we found that this approach does not conclusively distinguish between normal humans and those susceptible to malignant hyperthermia but nonetheless yielded important information about the action of dantrolene in man and in MH. Supramaximal single- and multiple-pulse stimulation of the common peroneal nerve produced stable torque responses of the dorsiflexor muscles (monitored in vivo), which dantrolene suppressed. With the multiple-pulse stimulation (5-6 pulses) this torque suppression was significantly less in MH-susceptible subjects than in control subjects. This distinction, also observed in MH swine, confirms this animal as a good model for human MH. That dantrolene's effect in MH can be more completely reversed with high frequency stimulation is intriguing; presumably, excitation-contraction coupling differs in MH and normal muscle. ",0
"Stroke rehabilitation: a geropsychological perspective. Rehabilitation medicine and geriatric medicine are similar in their concern for functional improvement in the face of chronic medical conditions. Although many patients served by rehabilitation medicine fall within the geriatric age range, a knowledge of normal aging does not necessarily inform clinical decision making or research practices in rehabilitation. Using stroke as an example of a disorder affecting primarily geriatric patients and requiring the technology of rehabilitation, ways in which age might affect assessment of outcome are examined. Three areas dealing with conceptual and methodologic issues--depression, neurochemical interventions, and family--are highlighted. The final section outlines recommendations for research on rehabilitation outcome of geriatric stroke patients. ",0
"Surgical management of oculomotor nerve palsy We treated seven patients with unilateral oculomotor nerve palsy by transposition of the insertion of the superior oblique tendon to a point anterior and medial to the insertion of the superior rectus muscle without trochleotomy (Scott procedure). Additionally, large recessions of the lateral rectus muscle of involved eyes and, occasionally, recess/resect procedures of horizontal recti muscles of non-involved eyes were performed. All patients were followed up between one and eight years. Orthophoria in the primary position was achieved and maintained with one operation in four patients. A fifth patient had only a small residual exotropia. In two patients who had aberrant regeneration of the oculomotor nerve, surgery on horizontal recti muscles of the noninvolved eye improved the eyelid position of the involved eye after three operations.

"Deep femoral to anterior tibial bypass after failed femoropopliteal reconstructions. Deep femoral to anterior tibial artery bypass is a reconstructive technique occasionally applicable when more conventional attempts at revascularization of the distal portion of the leg have failed. Three such patients, in whom the anterior tibial was the only distal patent branch of the popliteal artery, had severe symptoms of arterial insufficiency. Deep femoral to anterior tibial bypass was done using autogenous The distal portion of the deep femoral artery was exposed through an anteromedial distal thigh approach. The three patients have been followed up for a mean of 20.3 months, and each maintains graft patency and marked symptomatic improvement. ",0
"Closure of refractory perineal Crohn's lesion. Integration of hyperbaric oxygen into case management. A case is reported in which a comprehensive program of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO), surgical debridement and reconstruction, and continuing medical management resulted in complete and sustained closure of an extensive perineal Crohn's lesion refractory to conventional medical and surgical management. It is emphasized that in this case healing occurred in the setting of previous removal of all diseased intestinal tissue and only with the combined use of all three treatment modalities. HBO may be a useful adjunct in the therapy of large nonhealing perineal lesions post-proctocolectomy in patients who are unresponsive to metronidazole or to immunosuppressant therapy or who experience limiting side effects from continued medical therapy.

"Rehabilitation of three patients after treatment for herpes encephalitis. Patients with Herpes simplex encephalitis often are considered to be poor rehabilitation candidates because of their multiple deficits and grave prognosis. This report presents case reports on three patients with biopsy-proven Herpes simplex encephalitis, all of whom were treated with acyclovir in acute care and then admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation program. All had multiple brain lesions with minimal motor findings but cognitive and communication deficits. One patient, two weeks after admission, slipped into a coma and was transferred to an acute care hospital where he subsequently expired. The other two made useful functional gains and were discharged home in two weeks and 10 weeks, suggesting that a trial of rehabilitation may be warranted after Herpes simplex encephalitis. ",0
"Deletion of Alu sequences in the fifth c-sis intron in individuals with meningiomas. An abnormality in the c-sis protooncogene was identified in leukocyte DNA from members of a family predisposed to the development of meningioma, and was found to be associated with the development of the tumor in those individuals. Molecular analysis of this abnormality demonstrated a deletion within the fifth intron of the c-sis gene. The normal c-sis gene has an Alu sequence in this region which includes two perfect 130 nucleotide repeated sequences separated by 5 bp. The deleted c-sis allele is missing precisely one copy of the 130 bp repeat and the intervening 5 bp. An identical deletion was also found in DNA from 1 of 13 sporadic meningiomas. ",0
"A double-blind study of deflazacort and prednisone in patients with chronic inflammatory disorders. Deflazacort and prednisone were given to 26 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, or other chronic inflammatory diseases, in a double-blind study. Deflazacort rapidly and effectively suppressed disease activity in a manner supporting its assumed therapeutic potency of 83% that of prednisone. Prednisone induced a rapid increase in the level of daily calcium excretion that was not evident with deflazacort. Cortisol secretion was acutely inhibited by prednisone, but not by deflazacort. Neither corticosteroid had a significant effect on glucose metabolism, at the doses studied. Treatment with deflazacort may be an effective alternative to prednisone treatment, with fewer adverse effects on levels of calcium and cortisol, in patients with severe inflammatory conditions warranting the use of glucocorticoids.

"Angiography, angioscopy, and ultrasound imaging before and after percutaneous balloon angioplasty. We report two patients undergoing peripheral percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in whom angiography, angioscopy, and ultrasound imaging were performed before and after balloon angioplasty. The first case with smooth atheroma diagnosed by angiography was found to have unrecognized partially occlusive thrombus by angioscopy. After angioplasty, an intimal tear was identified by angioscopy and ultrasound but it was not seen by angiography. The intravascular ultrasound image showed the tear to extend to the adventitia. In the second case, an apparently smooth intimal surface as imaged by angiography was found by angioscopy and ultrasound to have extensive damage, including subintimal hemorrhage, intimal flaps, and arterial dissection at the angioplasty site. These data suggest that the type of information derived from the three imaging techniques is quite different, and that each may have a specific role in intravascular diagnosis. ",0
"A successful treatment of an intrarenal arteriovenous fistula by percutaneous embolization. A 37-year-old woman patient, known to have poorly controlled arterial hypertension that was diagnosed following a cerebrovascular accident at the age of 15 years, was referred to our outpatient clinic for investigation in 1987. An intrarenal arteriovenous fistula was diagnosed by selective renal angiography. Embolization of the fistula was performed using four 15-mm/5-cm coils, which induced thrombosis and obstructed the fistula. The vascularization of the affected kidney improved immediately. During the following 4 months, the antihypertensive treatment was stopped gradually, and the patient remained normotensive. This is an unusual case of a large intrarenal arteriovenous fistula, whose etiology was not clear, that was successfully treated by percutaneous embolization. ",0
"The influence of calcium alginate haemostatic swabs upon operative blood loss in adenotonsillectomy. Although adenotonsillectomy is regarded as a minor procedure, it has been shown that 18% of patients may experience an operative blood loss of 10-20% of the total blood volume. The aim of this study was to determine whether calcium alginate haemostatic swabs reduce operative blood loss in adenotonsillectomy. Seventy-two patients (ages 2-12 years) entered a prospective trial in which the operation was performed either with normal gauze swabs or calcium alginate swabs. Thirty-six children were randomized to each group. The mean blood loss was found to be 34.9 ml (2.07% of total blood volume) and 47.8 ml (2.97% of total blood volume) respectively. Although there was no significant reduction in operative blood loss using calcium alginate, in both groups the blood loss was much smaller than that stated by the majority of previous workers. ",0
"Reversal of chronic hepatic encephalopathy by colonic exclusion: poor correlation with blood GABA levels. Previous studies have suggested that the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a key factor in the syndrome of portasystemic encephalopathy. We report the case of a patient with medically intractable portasytemic encephalopathy after portacaval shunt who had marked clinical improvement after creation of an end ileostomy. Plasma GABA and serum ammonia levels were measured before and after ileostomy. Although the clinical syndrome and the EEG improved markedly after the ileostomy, the plasma GABA levels remained markedly elevated. Preoperative and postoperative GABA levels were 865 and 633 pmol/ml, respectively (nl = 100-180 pmol/ml). Our findings confirm previous reports of the efficacy of colonic exclusion in patients with intractable portasystemic encephalopathy. However, our results conflict with the hypothesis that GABA itself is the key mediator of the syndrome. ",0
"Dietary fat and risk of breast cancer. The relationship between dietary fat and subsequent risk of breast cancer was studied in 3988 initially cancer-free Finnish women aged 20-69 y. During a follow-up period of 20 y, 54 breast-cancer cases were diagnosed. Risk of breast cancer was significantly inversely related to energy intake and nonsignificantly inversely related to absolute fat intake. A positive association between energy-adjusted total fat intake and occurrence of breast cancer was also observed. The relative risk in the highest tertile as compared with the lowest tertile was 1.7 (95% confidence limits 0.6-4.8). The corresponding relative risks were 1.4 (0.5-3.7) for saturated fatty acids, 2.7 (1.0-7.4) for monounsaturated fatty acids, 1.2 (0.6-2.8) for polyunsaturated fatty acids, and 2.2 (1.0-5.0) for cholesterol intake. Adjustment for different potential confounding factors did not alter the results. The present data suggest that breast cancer is associated inversely with energy intake and weakly positively with energy-adjusted fat intake. ",0
"Reinforcement of incontinent stools in the treatment of encopresis. In this paper, fecal incontinence and constipation were treated in two mentally retarded individuals using a novel intervention wherein incontinent stools were first rewarded in order to increase the frequency of bowel movements. This intervention was implemented only after more traditional pediatric and behavioral treatments were unsuccessful. The reinforcement of incontinent stools procedure resulted in an increase in both the frequency and the number of continent stools for both individuals. Hypotheses regarding the failure of previous treatments and the success of the current treatment are discussed as well as directions for future research. ",0
"Background review and current concepts of reperfusion injury. We define the concept of reperfusion injury, and we present a background chronology of experimental work supporting and questioning this concept. We identify several new influences, such as current clinical interest in thrombolytic therapy for acute ischemia of heart and brain and the growing recognition of endothelium as a regulator of homeostasis. We propose that these influences will encourage a reexamination of reperfusion injury as a factor in the ultimate outcome of tissue exposed to reversible ischemia. We briefly discuss the major mechanisms presently implicated in reperfusion injury--loss of calcium homeostasis, free radical generation, leukocyte-mediated injury, and acute hypercholesterolemia.

"Infantile CNS spongy degeneration--14 cases: clinical update. We studied 14 Arab infants with infantile spongy degeneration, 13 of whom were products of consanguineous marriages. They presented in infancy with macrocephaly, poor visual behavior or blindness, and axial hypotonia with appendicular spasticity. Brain CT and MRI showed diffuse symmetric leukoencephalopathy, even before neurologic symptoms. There were relatively normal EEGs. The visual evoked responses (P100) were either absent or delayed early in the course. The brainstem auditory evoked responses showed milder abnormalities, with loss of later components before the earlier ones. Deficient aspartoacylase activity in cultured fibroblasts or brain biopsy confirmed the diagnosis in all patients. ",0
"Pseudocyst of the auricle: successful treatment with intracartilaginous trichloroacetic acid and button bolsters. Pseudocyst of the auricle is an asymptomatic, noninflammatory cystic swelling that typically involves the anthelix of the ear and results from an accumulation of fluid within an unlined intracartilaginous cavity. We report a patient with a recurrent pseudocyst of the auricle and describe a new surgical technique for treating this condition by applying 50% trichloroacetic acid to the intracartilaginous cavity and utilizing external button bolsters for compressive therapy. This therapeutic approach is simple to perform in the office, results in permanent resolution of the pseudocyst, preserves the normal architecture of the external ear, and provides excellent postoperative and long-term cosmetic results.

"Use of the fistula assessment monitor to detect stenoses in access fistulae. Twenty-three unselected hemodialysis patients with functioning access arteriovenous fistulae were studied prospectively to determine the best technique for detecting stenoses within the fistulae. Combined clinical assessment and fistula assessment monitoring were compared with transbrachial angiography. Fistula assessment monitoring was more accurate (96%) than combined clinical assessment (accuracy, 52%) in stenosis detection. Complications of angiography occurred in 17% of patients; there were no complications of fistula assessment monitoring. Fistula assessment monitoring was better than combined clinical assessment in predicting clinical outcome for arteriovenous fistulae over 6 months and was as good as angiography. Routine fistula assessment monitoring could reduce inappropriate angiography and detect clinically significant silent stenoses. It is an ideal method for monitoring arteriovenous access fistulae. ",0
"Reversal of chronic hepatic encephalopathy by colonic exclusion: poor correlation with blood GABA levels. Previous studies have suggested that the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a key factor in the syndrome of portasystemic encephalopathy. We report the case of a patient with medically intractable portasytemic encephalopathy after portacaval shunt who had marked clinical improvement after creation of an end ileostomy. Plasma GABA and serum ammonia levels were measured before and after ileostomy. Although the clinical syndrome and the EEG improved markedly after the ileostomy, the plasma GABA levels remained markedly elevated. Preoperative and postoperative GABA levels were 865 and 633 pmol/ml, respectively (nl = 100-180 pmol/ml). Our findings confirm previous reports of the efficacy of colonic exclusion in patients with intractable portasystemic encephalopathy. However, our results conflict with the hypothesis that GABA itself is the key mediator of the syndrome. ",0
"Serial neurobehavioral assessments in preterm infants. The purpose of this study was to compare serial neurobehavioral assessments in a sample of preterm infants with intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) to those of a group of unaffected preterm infants. Of the 30 infants included in the study, 5 infants had a grade III or IV/VI intraventricular hemorrhage. Infants with IVH demonstrated more abnormalities in mental status and a cluster of abnormal neurologic findings (persistent ankle clonus, tremulousness, and brisk deep tendon reflexes). Of the 30 infants, 20 infants were included in a brain metabolism study. Infants who had experienced an IVH had significantly different brain metabolism findings, as measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). There was a significant correlation between one measure of brain metabolism (PCr/PI) and the neurobehavioral assessment rating for infants with IVH. ",0
"Endothelial cell adhesiveness for human T lymphocytes is inhibited by transforming growth factor-beta 1. Recombinant human transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) was found to inhibit the adhesive phenotype of human umbilical vein endothelial cells for human PBL, purified T lymphocytes, and PHA-activated lymphoblasts. TGF-beta inhibited lymphocyte attachment to resting human umbilical vein endothelial cells and also to endothelial monolayers stimulated with the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta. Our investigations also show that the ability of endothelial cells to respond to TGF-beta by altering their adhesiveness is lost with prolonged culture of the cells. However, this loss is selective as TGF-beta inhibits cell proliferation in both early and late passage endothelial cells. These results suggest that in vivo TGF-beta may inhibit the adhesive phenotype of endothelial cells and also may limit the immunologic response occurring at the endothelial cell barrier. ",0
"Discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs in children who have outgrown epilepsy: effects on cognitive function. Cognitive function is frequently impaired in children with epilepsy, compared with age-matched controls. It can be hard to evaluate the significance of various contributory factors. The effects of antiepileptic drugs may be studied in children who have outgrown their epilepsy but are still being treated. A multicenter study to assess various aspects of cognitive function in children with different forms of epilepsy, both during and after treatment with antiepileptic drugs, is currently under way. Definitive results are not yet available; interim analysis of the findings suggests that short-term memory is decreased in all subgroups of children being treated for epilepsy, compared to controls.

"Tables for estimation of individual risks of fetal neural tube and ventral wall defects, incorporating prior probability, maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels, and ultrasonographic examination results. Tables are provided for estimation of the risk of open spina bifida in patients who have elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels but normal results on detailed anatomy ultrasonographic scan. Risks are provided for various prior population risks, for various levels of elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein, and for various assumptions about the sensitivity of ultrasonographic examination. The formula used is based on sequential multiplication of odds with the use of Bayes' theorem, but an arbitrary reduction (to the power of 0.5) in the degree to which ultrasonographic information modifies the odds has been made to allow for the nonindependence of ultrasonography and maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein tests. The wide range of resulting risks shows that the decision to offer amniocentesis after a negative scan should be individualized. ",0
Spinal coning after lumbar puncture in prostate cancer with asymptomatic vertebral metastasis: a case report. A 60-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for complete urinary retention. Prostate cancer was diagnosed and anti-cancer chemotherapy was administered. Regression of prostatic enlargement was appreciated and difficult urination improved. At 6 months after the initial treatment vertebral metastasis of T10-11 was noted on a bone scintigram but there were no symptoms induced by bone metastasis. Orchiectomy was performed with the patient under lumbar anesthesia. Complete paralysis of both lower extremities occurred postoperatively. Computerized tomography and myelographic findings demonstrated complete subarachnoid block with an extramedullary spinal cord tumor. It was concluded that traction on the spinal cord producing neurological deterioration (spinal coning) occurred after removal of the cerebrospinal fluid by lumbar puncture. ,0
"Left atrial to femoral arterial bypass using the biomedicus pump for operations of the thoracic aorta. Left atrial to left femoral arterial bypass is an approach to operations of the thoracic aorta dating back to the late 1950s. Since that time, various modifications of the basic bypass circuit have evolved. In addition, temporary bypass shunts have also been described in a variety of positions. The goals of bypass of the thoracic aorta regardless of the technique include prevention of distal hypoperfusion, which can lead to paraplegia, limb loss, multiple organ failure, and sometimes death. Recently, there have been reports of the use of the biomedicus centrifugal pump in bypass circuits of the thoracic aorta. Our series, as well as the success of others, using this variation of a traditional bypass circuit of the thoracic aorta, establishes the biopump's capability of minimizing inherent complications in the bypass circuit.

"Acute deterioration of renal function associated with enteric hyperoxaluria. Enteric hyperoxaluria due to malabsorption syndromes has been well documented to cause renal calculi and chronic tubulointerstitial renal damage. Rarely, in the setting of intestinal bypass operations for morbid obesity, enteric hyperoxaluria has produced acute renal failure. We report two patients who suffered acute deterioration of renal function associated with increased intestinal absorption and renal excretion of oxalate associated with steatorrhea. One patient had a large portion of his small bowel resected many years prior to the onset of the renal failure and the second patient had chronic pancreatitis causing steatorrhea. Both patients had renal biopsy documentation of the acute nature of the tubular damage produced by oxalate deposition. The mechanisms of their deterioration of renal function may relate to sudden increases in steatorrhea in association with episodes of volume depletion. Enteric hyperoxaluria may be an easily overlooked and potentially preventable etiology of acute renal dysfunction. ",0
"Experience with esmolol for the treatment of cocaine-associated cardiovascular complications. The authors report their experience using esmolol, an ultra-short acting beta-adrenergic antagonist, for the treatment of seven patients with cocaine-associated cardiovascular complications. No consistent hemodynamic benefit was found with the use of this drug. Although there was a decline in mean heart rate of 23% (range 0% to 35%), they were unable to show a consistent antihypertensive response. Adverse effects occurred in three patients. This included one patient with a marked exacerbation of hypertension and one who became hypotensive. Another patient developed emesis and lethargy during esmolol therapy and required endotracheal intubation. They do not recommend the routine use of esmolol for cocaine cardiotoxicity. ",0
"Prospective randomized comparison of Brown-McHardy and microvasive balloon dilators in treatment of achalasia. We report the results of a randomized prospective study comparing a standard bougie rubber balloon dilator [Brown-McHardy (BMH)] and a newer polyethylene dilator passed over a guide wire [Microvasive Rigiflex (MVR)]. Twenty achalasia patients (15M, 5F, mean age 45.4 yr) considered candidates for either dilator were randomized. Symptom assessment, body weight, and upright radionuclide solid esophageal emptying study were measured before and 6 months after pneumatic dilatation. All dilatations were performed by one of three experienced gastroenterologists under fluoroscopic guidance. Overall success occurred with 10/10 BMH and 7/10 MVR. One patient not improved with MVR had myotomy; the other two were successfully treated by BMH. No complications occurred with either dilator. ",0
"Ubiquitin hybrid protein gene expression during human colon cancer progression. Ubiquitin is involved in cell-cycle control and DNA replication through a specific proteolytic pathway. Our previous studies demonstrated selected higher expression of a gene encoding ubiquitin-ribosomal protein S27a in poorly differentiated colon carcinoma cell lines. In this study, we evaluated this ubiquitin hybrid protein gene expression in surgical specimens of colon cancers. Northern blot analysis showed that ubiquitin hybrid protein messenger RNA was overexpressed in primary colon cancers compared with adjacent normal colon mucosae in 17 of 20 patients. Dot blot analysis of RNA of 27 tumor samples revealed significantly greater expression in higher Dukes' stage primary colon tumors and liver metastases. These data imply that protein translation machinery is highly activated during progression and metastasis of colon tumors, and that ubiquitin hybrid protein may be useful as a marker of biological aggressiveness.

"Delayed subcapsular hematoma after percutaneous liver biopsy as a manifestation of warfarin toxicity. Guidelines for the management of patients receiving chronic anticoagulation therapy who require liver biopsy are not clearly defined. In patients with normal coagulation, liver biopsy is a relatively safe procedure with a morbidity of less than 0.1% and a mortality of less than 0.01%. We report a patient with a prosthetic aortic valve who developed a large subcapsular hematoma 12 days after a percutaneous liver biopsy as a consequence of warfarin toxicity. Based on the experience with this patient, reinstitution of anticoagulant therapy should be avoided for at least 72 h after a percutaneous liver biopsy. Intravenous heparin should be resumed first, and warfarin added if no bleeding has occurred after an additional 48-72 h. The prothrombin time should be maintained at 1.5 times the baseline. ",0
"Is sick sinus syndrome an adenosine-mediated disease? Effects of intravenous aminophylline on sick sinus node function after pharmacologic autonomic blockade. To assess the effects of intravenous aminophylline on the sinus node, 12 patients with clinical and Holter monitor-documented sick sinus syndrome were studied (1) during the control state, (2) after pharmacologic autonomic blockade and (3) 5 min after intravenous administration of aminophylline. The effects of aminophylline on sinus node function were compared with those after pharmacologic autonomic blockade. No significant improvement of sinus node function was found after intravenous aminophylline administration with a mean sinus cycle length and a mean maximum CSRT of 968 +/- 218 and 1832 +/- 1036 ms, respectively. The mean serum theophylline level was 10.9 +/- 1.7 micrograms/ml. Since aminophylline is an adenosine receptor antagonist, these findings suggest that intrinsic adenosine may not play an important role in pathogenesis in patients with chronic and advanced sick sinus syndrome.

"The use of internalised ureteric stents in renal transplant recipients. Since 1982, we have used internal indwelling ureteric stents for the management and prevention of ureteric reconstruction complications in 28 renal allograft recipients. A total of 30 stents were placed in 18 patients either diagnostically or therapeutically in the management of allograft ureteric obstruction. In 16 patients internal stents were placed at the time of reconstruction for primary ureteropyelostomy (3), secondary ureteropyelostomy (8), repeat reimplant (3) and repair of ureteric or pelviureteric junction injury (2). Complications included 3 episodes of transplant pyelonephritis, proximal stent migration (1), persistent bacteriuria (1) and prolonged healing of a ureteropyelostomy (1). Internalised ureteric stenting is a safe and effective means of managing or preventing ureteric reconstruction complications in renal transplant recipients. ",0
"Doppler echocardiographic evaluation of streptokinase lysis of thrombosed right-sided St. Jude Medical valves in patients with congenital heart defects. Four episodes of St. Jude Medical prosthesis leaflet thrombosis were serially evaluated by two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography during treatment with streptokinase. Three patients aged 4, 11, and 24 years with congenital heart disease had St. Jude Medical valves in pulmonary positions (two cases) for tetralogy of Fallot and in the tricuspid position (one case). The duration of thrombosis was not known in any patient. Leaflet immobility and its resolution were demonstrated by echocardiography and were confirmed fluoroscopically. Continuous wave Doppler echocardiography showed abnormal stenotic gradients in thrombosed valves that were reduced after thrombolysis. These studies demonstrate the utility of two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography in serial evaluation of prosthetic pulmonary and tricuspid valve thrombosis during thrombolysis. ",0
"Immunoprofile of mucoepidermoid carcinomas of minor salivary glands. Because the data on the antigenic phenotype of mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) are incomplete and somewhat disparate, 45 MECs were evaluated immunohistochemically for low- and high-molecular-weight keratins, vimentin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, smooth muscle actin, and S-100 protein. Tumors stained uniformly for keratins and, on occasion, focally for vimentin. Tumors were nonreactive with antibodies to glial fibrillary acidic protein and, with few exceptions, to muscle-specific actins and S-100 protein. Clear cell and papillary histologic variants were seen as potential diagnostic pitfalls. If used with hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained sections, limited potential is seen for this antibody panel in surgical pathology. Myoepithelial cell-associated antigens are expressed to a very limited extent in MECs. ",0
Study of preneoplastic changes of liver cells by immunohistochemical and molecular hybridization techniques. The status of hepatitis B virus DNA was investigated by in situ hybridization in multifocal areas of a noncancerous hepatitis B virus-associated cirrhosis. This liver exhibited a marked degree of dysplasia and adenomatous hyperplasia. The results of these studies were correlated with the histopathology and immunohistochemical stains for hepatitis B core and surface antigens. There was clear evidence of a marked reduction to absence of hepatitis B viral DNA by in situ hybridization and absence of HBc and HBsAg in the foci of liver cell dysplasia and adenomatous hyperplasia. These results support the hypothesis that liver cell dysplasia and adenomatous hyperplasia are preneoplastic in nature. ,0
"Effects of tracheal irritation and hypercapnia on tracheal smooth muscle in humans. Both hypercapnia and tracheal irritation are known to constrict the airways in animals. To see whether similar responses occur in humans, we investigated tracheal smooth muscle (TSM) responses to hypercapnia and tracheal irritation with water in 14 paralyzed and anesthetized humans. TSM tone was monitored by measuring the pressure in the saline-filled cuff of the endotracheal tube. Although, tracheal irritation caused TSM constriction in 10 of 14 patients, 4 patients showed no TSM response. Administration of intravenous atropine attenuated the TSM constriction response. Hypercapnia did not cause any change in TSM tone in any of the 14 patients. These results indicate that in paralyzed and anesthetized humans, there exist interindividual differences in the TSM responses to tracheal irritation and that hypercapnia cannot be an effective stimulus for the TSM constriction.

"Orthostatic hypotension in human immunodeficiency virus infection may be the result of generalized autonomic nervous system dysfunction. We used an autonomic nervous system (ANS) testing battery to determine if generalized ANS dysfunction was present in five human immunodeficiency virus-positive (HIV+) patients presenting with severe orthostatic hypotension (OH). All five patients had abnormal ANS testing, which demonstrated both sympathetic and parasympathetic defects, i.e., generalized ANS dysfunction. Treatment with fludrocortisone effectively reversed the OH in four of the five patients. The OH was transient in these four patients. We believe it is important to recognize that OH may be the result of generalized ANS dysfunction in HIV-positive patients and that it can be effectively treated. ",0
"Overt hepatic encephalopathy precipitated by zinc deficiency. Encephalopathy in liver disease may be unresponsive to protein restriction, lactulose, and neomycin. Zinc supplements have been reported to improve psychometric performance in liver cirrhosis, but the importance of zinc deficiency in overt hepatic encephalopathy has not yet been clearly established. A patient with severe recurrent hepatic encephalopathy was studied to determine the relation between her signs of encephalopathy and zinc deficiency. The study included a period in which zinc deficiency was artificially induced by oral histidine. An episode of overt encephalopathy occurred that was identical to earlier episodes and responded to oral zinc. The study showed an association between encephalopathy and zinc deficiency by successive zinc depletion and supplementation regimens. Long-term zinc supplementation improved severe recurrent hepatic encephalopathy and therefore the quality of life. ",0
"A randomized trial of the effect of three non-steroid anti-inflammatory agents in ameliorating cancer-induced fever. Paraneoplastic fever is well known, and is not an uncommon problem in daily practice. In an effort to ameliorate tumour-induced fever we randomized 48 patients to receive three different non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs: Naproxen (500 mg d-1), Indomethacin (75 mg d-1) or Diclophenac sodium (75 mg d-1). All patients had solid tumours, and microbial infection had been excluded. All three drugs were equally effective in bringing the temperature down to normal for a period of 30-33 d. Naproxen had the most rapid effect. In cases of fever relapse with the first drug, when the other two drugs were given instead, both proved equally effective. No side-effects were observed. We conclude that Naproxen, Indomethacin and Diclophenac sodium are equally effective in ameliorating paraneoplastic fever. In relapse, a second drug given subsequently can be effective as well. ",0
"Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome terminating as disseminated T-cell lymphoma. The authors describe a case of idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) terminated as a T-cell lymphoma in a 3-year-old girl. The clinical course was chronic and characterized by chronic eczema, persistent peripheral blood eosinophilia, organomegaly, interstitial lung change, and pericarditis. Postmortem examination demonstrated a disseminated T-cell lymphoma involving the inguinal lymph node, liver, lung, and kidney. The findings of the current case suggest a possibility that certain abnormalities in this case of idiopathic HES per se may have triggered the development of malignant lymphoma, and it may represent a transition of idiopathic HES into a T-cell lymphoma. Other possible sequences are discussed. The development of T-cell malignancy in idiopathic HES in a girl is quite an unusual presentation. ",0
"A new method for mapping hepatic subsegment: counterstaining identification technique. Hepatic subsegmentectomy requires identification of the borders of tumor-bearing subsegment, usually achieved by injecting dye into the portal veins feeding the domain. We describe an alternative technique for performing systematic subsegmentectomy in patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, in whom hepatic arterial and portal venous embolizations were already performed as a preoperative adjuvant. Under ultrasonic guidance, each of the neighboring portal units is sequentially stained, thus defining the avascular subsegment to be resected as the nonstaining area. This allows the subsegment to be totally resected. This counterstaining identification technique can be used for all subsegments undergoing complete embolization and for other situations in which the usual staining method is impossible because of the presence of arterioportal shunting or portal tumor thrombus.

"Crohn disease in the pediatric patient: CT evaluation. Computed tomographic (CT) scans and medical records of 25 children (age range, 10-18 years) with pathologically proved Crohn disease were reviewed to better define the role of CT in the management of pediatric patients with Crohn disease. CT findings included small bowel thickening (range, 5-10 mm) (n = 20), colonic wall thickening (range, 6-15 mm) (n = 15), and small bowel dilation (n = 5). Mesenteric abnormalities such as adenopathy and focal fatty proliferation were seen in 11 to 18 patients, respectively. Extraluminal complications were easily identified with CT. Abscesses were noted in seven patients, inflammatory masses in four, and perirectal or perineal inflammation in 10. Fistulas were detected in four patients. The authors conclude that CT should be the initial imaging study performed in children with known Crohn disease and a changing pattern of clinical symptoms. ",0
"The surprising kidney-fluid mechanism for pressure control--its infinite gain! In this short paper, I have tried to explain the elation that we felt when we first realized that the kidney-fluid mechanism for controlling the arterial pressure has an infinite feedback gain property. Because of this, all the other pressure control mechanisms, none of which has ever been shown to have a similar infinite gain property, must themselves alter the kidney-fluid mechanism if they are to succeed in causing long-term changes in the arterial pressure. We have not been able to refute this principle despite many experiments over the last 2 decades. For this reason, our first understanding of the infinite gain property of the kidney-fluid mechanism was like a light at the end of the tunnel. I hope that I can explain to the reader the excitement of those few seconds when we first recognized the principle in 1966. ",0
"Preoperative piroxicam for postoperative analgesia in dental surgery. Fifty patients were allocated randomly to receive placebo or piroxicam 40 mg, 2.5 h before surgical removal of lower third molars under general anaesthesia. A significantly greater number of patients in the piroxicam group did not require opioid analgesia after operation (P less than 0.05). The piroxicam group also required fewer doses of paracetamol in the first 24 h after recovery from anaesthesia (P less than 0.05), and the time from recovery to first postoperative analgesia was longer in those patients who had received piroxicam (P less than 0.05). Piroxicam did not significantly prolong the duration of recovery from anaesthesia. ",0
"Lower respiratory tract infections. Although lower respiratory tract infections are frequently diagnosed in a primary care setting, they are still associated with a significant morbidity and mortality, which warrants a careful approach to treatment. Knowledge of the most common cause based on the age of the patient, location where the infection was acquired, and clinical presentation helps to direct empiric treatment. A few basic laboratory studies, especially a sputum Gram stain, can allow for more specific treatment. Identification of patients at increased risk for virulent organisms should make the primary care physician consider inpatient treatment along with an aggressive diagnostic workup and broad-spectrum antimicrobial treatment. Prevention should always be considered. ",0
"Experimental retinal branch vein occlusion in miniature pigs induces local tissue hypoxia and vasoproliferative microangiopathy. In miniature pigs, retinal veins were experimentally occluded using argon laser coagulation. Microvascular modifications leading to retinal hemorrhages and retinal edema were observed some hours after the occlusion. These lesions resolved progressively within 3 weeks after the occlusion, but in most cases ischemic retinal territories persisted. Preretinal partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) measurements, using double barrelled O2-sensitive microelectrodes, showed that all the ischemic areas were indeed hypoxic. In half of the experiments, preretinal and intravitreal new vessels grew on the ischemic territories. Tissue hypoxia appears to be a key step in triggering neovascularization. However, the critical level of hypoxia was not determined. ",0
"A seromuscular stripping method to create a nipple valve without metal stapling for continent urinary reservoir. Urinary continence with a Kock or Mainz pouch is achieved by a nipple valve of the invaginated ileum which is usually fixed with metal staples. However, metal staples can cause various complications as a foreign body. The seromuscular stripping method, a new technique to create a nipple valve, was applied to 17 patients with bladder cancer in the construction of a continent urinary reservoir by the ileocolonic pouch (Mainz pouch). Metal staples were not used. The results were satisfactory except for 2 patients who became incontinent because of prolapse of the nipple in one and insufficient valve function due to ischemic change of the nipple valve in the other. Histology of the nipple valve from an autopsy case showed a good double layer nipple valve that functioned well to preserve continence. ",0
"Standards for evaluating results of interventional therapy for peripheral vascular disease. Uniform standards for evaluating and reporting the results of therapeutic interventions for peripheral vascular disease are clearly needed. They are already established for vascular surgery, as represented by several reports by SVS/ISCVS committees, but they are not always followed by vascular surgeons and have been largely ignored by other vascular interventionists. In this article, the major problematic reporting practices are discussed and illustrated, and 14 recommendations are advanced to deal with them. They are intended to provide precise definitions, objective criteria of success or failure, standardized severity gradation schemes for peripheral vascular disease and its risk factors, and proper procedures for reporting the outcome of all forms of therapeutic intervention. Until these or some other agreed upon reporting standards are accepted and followed, the literature on peripheral vascular disease and its management will continue to be a source of confusion rather than enlightenment.

"Hemodynamic effects of H2-receptor antagonists. Histamine H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) often are administered to intensive care unit patients in an attempt to reduce gastric acidity and to prevent stress-related mucosal damage. These agents have an extremely low overall incidence and severity of adverse reactions; however, hemodynamically significant hypotension has been noted. Clinical studies with rapidly administered intravenous cimetidine in critically ill patients have demonstrated a depression in blood pressure in up to 75 percent of patients. Ranitidine, also studied in this setting, does not appear to induce similar hemodynamic changes. The newer H2RAs, famotidine and nizatidine, have not been evaluated in critically ill patients. ",0
"Acute water intoxication as a complication of urine drug testing in the workplace Urine drug testing is now mandatory in many industries. We report the first case, to our knowledge, of an adverse consequence of drug testing in the workplace: acute water intoxication. We discuss normal water metabolism and the adverse effects of water loading and impaired renal function on free water clearance. We present a literature review of seven other cases of acute voluntary water intoxication in patients without chronic psychiatric or neurologic illness. For workers undergoing urine drug testing we conclude that risk factors for acute water intoxication include (1) intake of more than 1 L of water and (2) impaired urine dilution. In a recently drug-tested worker, symptoms of cerebral dysfunction should suggest the possibility of water intoxication. ",0
"Assessing the severity of dementia. Patient and caregiver. In dementia there is cognitive impairment, disability in daily life, and sometimes behavioral disturbance. These changes are a burden for the caregivers of patients with dementia. Few studies are available that examine all these aspects and their interrelationships in a single patient group. In our study we selected detailed methods for assessment of all these aspects. Interrelationships were studied in 30 mild to moderately impaired patients with dementia and their caregivers. Although the relations of cognitive deterioration to disability in daily life and of burden experienced by the caregiver to patient's condition were stronger than often reported, it was impossible to deduce the overall severity of dementia from one single aspect. Thus, for effective management of patients and caregivers, for evaluation of individual treatment or of clinical trials, attention should be paid to all the different aspects of patients' condition and caregivers' burden. Outcome measurements will then be more valid. ",0
"Evaluation of the fine needle aspiration biopsy in the preoperative selection of cold thyroid nodules. From 1980 to 1988 the authors examined by fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) 4609 patients with solitary thyroid nodules or multinodular goiters. A total of 5605 ""cold"" thyroid nodules were evaluated and classified, on the basis of the cytologic findings, as malignant, follicular lesions (probably malignant and probably benign) and benign. Then the authors compared the preoperative cytologic findings with the postoperative histologic results in 827 nodules from patients who underwent surgery. In the 805 thyroid nodules in which an adequate cytologic specimen was obtained, false-negative results were 2.3% and false-positive findings were 1.1% By comparing cytologic and histologic diagnoses, preoperative FNAB resulted in the ability to accurately assess the risk of cancer in a thyroid nodule; since 250 nodules were identified as malignant, the risk of a ""cold"" thyroid nodule being cancer was 4.46% in this series.

"Suppressive effects of visceral tumor on the generation of antitumor T cells for adoptive immunotherapy. Antitumor reactive cells can be generated from lymphoid organs of mice bearing subcutaneous (SC), but not liver or lung, tumors by in vitro sensitization with irradiated tumor and interleukin 2. To examine whether visceral tumors mediated tumor-induced suppression, in vitro sensitization cells were generated from mice bearing SC tumors with and without concomitant liver or lung tumors. Antitumor efficacy of these cells was assessed in adoptive immunotherapy experiments. The presence of visceral tumors suppressed the ability to generate therapeutic in vitro sensitization cells from mice with SC tumors. By establishing visceral tumors at different intervals in relationship to SC tumor inoculation, we found that visceral tumor appeared to suppress directly the development of a host immune response to SC tumor, rather than inhibit function of established immune cells. Our model affords a means to study mechanisms of tumor-induced immunosuppression. ",0
"Regional differences in the intranodal distribution of tumor cells. The intranodal distribution of tumor cells was examined in 103 mesenteric and 135 axillary nodes to determine the frequency of a circumferential type of distribution and its relationship, if any, to central necrosis. Eighteen percent of the mesenteric nodes removed at surgery from patients with colon cancer contained a circumferential rim of viable tumor cells in an area corresponding wholly or in part to the normal location of the marginal sinus. In each case this rim of tumor cells surrounded a large central area of necrosis. In contrast, only one of the 135 axillary nodes removed from patients with breast cancer demonstrated this pattern. These findings suggest that by interrupting blood and lymph vessels, the circumferential spread of tumor cells underlies development of central necrosis. Previously described structural dissimilarities between mesenteric and axillary nodes may explain the striking difference in incidence of this pattern in these nodes. ",0
"Thyroidectomy under local anesthesia. Thyroidectomy for benign and malignant disease is most commonly performed with the patient under general anesthesia, although the literature is sprinkled with reports of series of operations performed using local anesthetic techniques. A retrospective review of 43 sequential thyroidectomies compares 21 performed using local anesthesia with 22 performed using general anesthesia. No significant difference was demonstrated in the incidence of major complications. All patients who required a second operation to remove the remaining hemithyroid after the final pathology reports were reviewed elected local anesthesia for their second procedure, attesting to patient satisfaction. Some hemithyroidectomies performed using local anesthesia were outpatient procedures. The indications, guidelines for patient selection, and operative technique of this effective alternative approach to thyroid surgery are presented. ",0
"Aggressive therapeutic amniocentesis for treatment of twin-twin transfusion syndrome. Acute severe twin-twin transfusion syndrome occurs in about 1% of monochorionic twin gestations. In the most severe form, acute hydramnios develops in the recipient twin's sac and fetal hydrops may be present. The donor twin is anemic and oligohydramnios is present, so that the donor appears ""stuck"" in a cocoon made by its adherent amnion. In this report, aggressive therapeutic amniocentesis restored amniotic fluid volume to normal in both sacs in all pregnancies. Fetal hydrops resolved in three of five (60%) of the fetuses affected. Pregnancy was extended a mean 80 +/- 33 days (+/- 2 SD) and perinatal survival was 79%. These findings contrast dramatically with the virtual 100% mortality reported in the literature with no therapy. Repeated aggressive amniocentesis effectively reversed the physiology of twin-twin transfusion syndrome and should be the treatment of choice for acute hydramnios, which previously had no recommended therapy.

"Dissection of the cardinal ligament in radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer with emphasis on the lateral ligament. Surgical experience with carcinomas of the uterus and rectum has provided new insights into the surgical anatomy of a lamina, which separates the paravesical space from the pararectal space. It has been proved that each of the lamina consists of the cardinal and lateral ligaments and pelvic splanchnic nerves, descending in the following order. The cardinal and lateral ligaments, as a connective stalk, insert into the lateral walls of the uterus and rectum extending from the inner aspect of the pelvic wall. Clarification of this structural relationship led to the development of a new procedure for the dissection of the cardinal ligament in radical hysterectomy, while still preserving the lateral ligament. This facilitated systematic dissection of the cardinal and uterosacral ligaments with posterior manipulation, leading to a reduction in blood loss and to prevention of brisk bleeding from the venous plexuses.

"Hemodynamic effects of partial correction of chronic anemia by recombinant human erythropoietin in patients on dialysis. Eighteen patients on chronic hemodialysis with renal anemia were treated with recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO). Hemodynamic parameters in the resting state were determined before and after successful treatment. Posttreatment cardiac index was decreased (3.3 v 2.8 L/min/m2), whereas diastolic blood pressure (72 v 79 mm Hg) and calculated peripheral resistance (2,230 v 2,860 dyne.cm.s-5) were increased significantly when compared with the pretreatment period. We conclude from our study that the increase of blood pressure as seen in patients on dialysis, who are effectively treated with r-HuEPO, is due to an increase in peripheral resistance. This increase overrules the decrease of cardiac index and might well be a result of peripheral vasoconstriction due to improved oxygen availability. ",0
"Peritoneal closure or non-closure at cesarean. The value of peritoneal closure at the time of cesarean birth was evaluated prospectively. Two hundred forty-eight women undergoing low transverse cesarean through a Pfannenstiel skin incision were assigned to one of two groups: peritoneum open (N = 127) or peritoneum closed (N = 121). The mean (+/- SEM) surgical time in the open group (48.1 +/- 1.2 minutes) was significantly less than for the closed group (53.2 +/- 1.4 minutes) (P less than .005). There were no postoperative differences between the groups in the incidence of wound infection, dehiscence, endometritis, ileus, and length of hospital stay. Our study suggests that leaving the parietal peritoneum unsutured is an acceptable way to manage patients at cesarean delivery. ",0
"Use of a central 10 degrees field and size V stimulus to evaluate and monitor small central islands of vision in end stage glaucoma. In a retrospective review of 24 clinically stable eyes with small central islands of vision due to end stage glaucoma the combined use of a central 10 degrees program and size V stimulus (10-2 with V) measured visual function undetected on a central 30 degrees field tested with both the standard size III and non-standard size V stimuli. Furthermore, the mean sensitivity of the 10-2 with V remained stable on serial field testing (mean 3.9 examinations) on long term follow-up (mean 22.2 months). This study suggests that in end stage glaucoma the size V target is the stimulus of choice and a central 10 degrees field may be the program of choice of evaluating and monitoring small central islands of vision.

"Myotonic heart disease: a clinical follow-up. We followed 37 patients with myotonic dystrophy for a mean of 6 years. Two developed atrial flutter or fibrillation, 6 developed a new bundle branch block, 1 developed complete heart block requiring a pacemaker, and another with progressive 1st-degree heart block and a widening QRS interval had a sudden death. Most patients had predictable, gradually progressive disease of their cardiac conduction system. We recommend that patients with progressive atrioventricular block or widening QRS interval due to myotonic heart disease have yearly ECGs and be questioned about syncope or presyncope to determine the need for a cardiac pacemaker.

"Synergism of herpes simplex virus and tobacco-specific N'-nitrosamines in cell transformation. Previous studies indicate that herpes simplex virus (HSV) enhances the carcinogenic activity of smokeless tobacco and tobacco-related chemical carcinogens in animals. Since tobacco-specific N'-nitrosamines (TSNAs) such as N'-nitrosonornicotine (NNN) and 4-(N-methyl-N'-nitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) are major chemical carcinogens of smokeless tobacco and are known to be responsible for the development of oral cancers in smokeless tobacco users, the combined effects of TSNAs and HSV in cell transformation were investigated. Exposure of cells to NNN or NNK followed by virus infection resulted in a significant enhancement of transformation frequency when compared with that observed with chemical carcinogens or virus alone. This study suggests that TSNAs and HSV can interact together and show synergism in cell transformation. ",0
"Home blood pressure readings in borderline hypertensive patients. Home blood pressure monitoring can provide valuable information for physicians managing borderline hypertensive patients. This study was conducted to compare office and home blood pressures in 36 borderline hypertensive subjects, and to determine the accuracy of the home monitoring unit used. The patients were very willing to record their home blood pressures for an extended period of time. The home blood pressure monitors were found to be quite accurate, and blood pressures measured at home were significantly lower than readings obtained in the office. In 39% (14 of 36) of the subjects studied, the average home blood pressures were more than 10 mmHg lower than their office readings. These findings support the hypothesis that home blood pressure monitoring can be useful in the management of borderline hypertensive patients. ",0
"Elevated serum bromide concentrations following repeated halothane anaesthesia in a child. A 20-month-old child received 25 brief halothane general anaesthetics over a five-week period to allow cranial irradiation treatments for a posterior fossa ependymoma. Personality change during the last week of the treatment protocol raised the question of possible bromide intoxication. Serum bromide concentrations, using a gold chloride assay technique, were monitored at that time, and at four- and six-week intervals thereafter. Serum bromide concentrations demonstrated a four-fold change during this period ranging from peak levels of 2.2 mEq.L-1 (176 micrograms.kg-1) during the fifth week of treatment decreasing to less than 0.5 mEq.L-1 (less than 40 micrograms.ml-1) six weeks following the end of treatments. This demonstrates the possibility for repetitive, short halothane exposures to result in elevations of serum bromide and the potential of bromide intoxication in paediatric neuro-oncology patients.

"Regional differences in the intranodal distribution of tumor cells. The intranodal distribution of tumor cells was examined in 103 mesenteric and 135 axillary nodes to determine the frequency of a circumferential type of distribution and its relationship, if any, to central necrosis. Eighteen percent of the mesenteric nodes removed at surgery from patients with colon cancer contained a circumferential rim of viable tumor cells in an area corresponding wholly or in part to the normal location of the marginal sinus. In each case this rim of tumor cells surrounded a large central area of necrosis. In contrast, only one of the 135 axillary nodes removed from patients with breast cancer demonstrated this pattern. These findings suggest that by interrupting blood and lymph vessels, the circumferential spread of tumor cells underlies development of central necrosis. Previously described structural dissimilarities between mesenteric and axillary nodes may explain the striking difference in incidence of this pattern in these nodes. ",0
"A protocol for the investigation of pregnancy loss. A protocol for the evaluation of pregnancy loss should include a maternal history, dysmorphic examination of the fetus or abortus, photographs, autopsy, chromosome studies (in most cases), and radiographic or xeroradiographic studies. Selected cases with suspected ascending or transplacental infection may require microbiologic investigation. Increasing specialized laboratory techniques may help in the diagnosis of inborn errors of metabolism or storage disorders. Coordination of studies requires the interaction of OB/GYN, pathology, genetics, cytogenetics, and nursing in order to assure delivery of this clinical service. Knowledge of the causes of pregnancy loss and their typical time and mode of presentation can facilitate a focused evaluation, with a high chance of achieving an accurate diagnosis. The goal of all investigations is to provide families with recurrence risk data on which to base future childbearing decisions, as well as information on potential prenatal monitoring. ",0
"Premature alveolar bone loss in Erdheim-Chester disease. Erdheim-Chester disease is a rare histiocytosis also known as lipoid granulomatosis. Oral findings have not been reported previously to our knowledge. This case report documents evidence of oral sequelae of Erdheim-Chester disease. A patient whose course was followed for 10 years at the National Institutes of Health had premature alveolar bone resorption. He underwent full-mouth extraction at age 29 years because of severe periodontitis. Histopathologic evidence of Erdheim-Chester disease was demonstrated in the periodontal soft tissues. In the ensuring years, accelerated resorption of the residual ridges precluded the use of conventional dentures. We recommend early preventive dental management for patients with Erdheim-Chester disease. ",0
"A recurrent pelvic desmoid tumor successfully treated with tamoxifen. A case of recurrent retroperitoneal desmoid tumor successfully treated with tamoxifen (Nolvadex tablets, ICI Pharma, Division of ICI Americas, Wilmington, DE) is reported. The patient presented late in her second pregnancy with a large retroperitoneal pelvic desmoid tumor that was treated with surgical excision and megestrol acetate. When the tumor recurred 12 months later, it was again treated with surgery, this time followed by radiation therapy. The desmoid tumor quickly recurred. The patient was then treated with tamoxifen, resulting in a complete tumor regression that has remained stable for 27 months. Tamoxifen should be considered as first-line therapy in recurrent desmoid tumors. ",0
"Push-enteroscopy for diagnosis of patients with gastrointestinal bleeding of obscure origin. Push-enteroscopy using a disinfected colonoscope was performed on 39 patients with gastrointestinal bleeding of obscure origin. Our results show that: (1) A high percentage of patients (38%) have pathological lesions responsible for bleeding located in the distal duodenum and proximal jejunum, which are readily detected by push-enteroscopy. (2) Duodeno-jejunal arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are the most common cause for bleeding, and these lesions can be conveniently cauterized through the endoscope. (3) An efficient sequence of steps for diagnosis of patients with this problem includes push-enteroscopy when the initial EGD and colonoscopy are normal followed by small bowel radiography. Mesenteric angiography and intraoperative enteroscopy can be reserved for patients with severe bleeding when push-enteroscopy and small bowel radiography are negative. We conclude that push-enteroscopy has an important role to play in the early assessment of patients with gastrointestinal bleeding of obscure origin. ",0
Possible role of leukotrienes in gastritis associated with Campylobacter pylori. This study was done to evaluate the role of leukotrienes (LTs) in gastritis associated with Campylobacter pylori. Biopsy specimens of gastric mucosa were obtained endoscopically from 18 patients with nonulcer dyspepsia for bacteriological and histological examination and extraction of LTs. There was correlation between the LTB4 level in the mucosa and the degree of gastritis evaluated histologically. The level was higher when infiltration of neutrophils in the gastric mucosa was more extensive. The LTB4 level in mucosa infected with C. pylori was higher than that in noninfected mucosa. These findings suggest that endogenous LTs may be related to the pathogenesis of gastritis associated with C. pylori. ,0
"Cochlear implant flap complications. In a series of 52 patients who received cochlear implants, 4 patients suffered flap complications (7.7%). The problems encountered involved the postauricular flap and were usually minor in nature. None required explantation as a direct result of these complications. Flap ischemia in a patient with Cogan's syndrome and vasculitis, two cases of suture extrusion with one having exposure of the implant, and a case of receiver unit magnet extrusion repaired with a vascularized pericranial flap based upon temporalis muscle are presented. Flap design in patients who have had postauricular incisions demands special consideration. Principles useful for avoiding complications as well as their management are discussed. ",0
"Indications for use of ketoconazole in management of metastatic prostate cancer. Newer methods of androgen ablation for the treatment of metastatic prostatic carcinoma have been developed as alternatives to the standard forms of therapy, oral estrogens and surgical castration. The purpose of this review is to elucidate the indications and to determine the role of ketoconazole in the management of metastatic prostatic cancer. Eighteen patients have been treated with ketoconazole. The indications for usage have included: prompt therapeutic response, when orchiectomy is contraindicated, when estrogens are contraindicated, initial empirical therapy, and hormonally refractory disease. It can also be used in conjunction with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogues. Ketoconazole is excellent for short-term usage prior to bilateral orchiectomy and when prompt therapeutic response is needed but orchiectomy cannot be performed. However, it is not particularly useful for long-term hormonal therapy. ",0
"Middle cerebral artery strokes causing homonymous hemianopia: positron emission tomography. Eight patients were evaluated with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography between 3 and 30 days after isolated stroke involving the middle cerebral artery territory that caused homonymous hemianopia. Diffuse hypometabolism was present throughout the damaged cerebral hemisphere, even in cortical areas not obviously ischemic by clinical examination or neuro-imaging. Glucose metabolism in primary and association visual cortex of the damaged hemisphere was decreased by more than 47% (p less than 0.01). Metabolism in the undamaged hemisphere was less profoundly affected, but significant decrements were found in calcarine (40%; p less than 0.01) and lateral occipital cortex (35%; p less than 0.05).

"Tuberculous psoas muscle abscess following chemoprophylaxis with isoniazid in a patient with human immunodeficiency virus infection. A 34-year-old man with human immunodeficiency virus infection and disseminated Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium intracellulare infection developed a right psoas muscle abscess due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The abscess occurred 18 months after completion of a 12-month course of chemoprophylaxis with isoniazid that was given because of a positive reaction with purified protein derivative of tuberculin. The adjacent vertebrae did not appear to be involved. The abscess was drained with a percutaneously inserted catheter, and he received standard antituberculous chemotherapy. Three weeks into therapy, a second drainage with a catheter was required. The isolation of two mycobacteria in this patient and the apparent failure of chemoprophylaxis with isoniazid are noted. ",0
"Aggravation of human and experimental myasthenia gravis by contrast media. After observing a 72-year-old myasthenic patient develop an acute myasthenic exacerbation following the administration of routine diagnostic IV contrast material, an observation rarely described in the literature, we used the experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis model in rabbits injected with a contrast agent to simulate the situation. There was significant worsening of the decremental response to 3 Hz repetitive nerve stimulation from 40 +/- 29% to 55 +/- 27% following the IV administration of contrast agent at doses similar to those used in humans. IV calcium partially reversed this aggravation. Caution is merited when myasthenic patients are administered contrast media. ",0
"Prospective randomized comparison of intravesical with percutaneous bacillus Calmette-Guerin versus intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin in superficial bladder cancer. Conflicting reports of the necessity for percutaneous bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) administration with intravesical BCG prompted us to evaluate its benefit in a randomized prospective comparison of intravesical versus intravesical with percutaneous BCG therapy. Intravesical Tice BCG was given in a dose of 50 mg. with or without percutaneous BCG weekly for 6 weeks, at 8, 10 and 12 weeks, at 6 months and every 6 months thereafter. Tumor recurrence was documented in 13 of 30 patients (43%) receiving only intravesical BCG and in 15 of 36 patients (42%) receiving intravesical plus percutaneous BCG. The addition of percutaneous BCG to intravesical therapy did not increase treatment efficacy in this study. ",0
"Vasal injuries during childhood and their effect on subsequent fertility. Thirty subfertile males had testicular obstruction following inguinal or pelvic surgery in childhood. All 13 patients with bilateral obstruction were azoospermic and 6 had developed antibodies to spermatozoa. Of 17 patients with unilateral obstruction, 11 had oligozoospermia and 6 had normal sperm counts: all had high titres of antibodies to spermatozoa (a significant difference from the men with bilateral obstruction). This indicates that male infertility can result from vasal or epididymal injuries in childhood due either to the obstruction itself or its immunological consequences. Following corrective surgery and prednisolone treatment for the antibodies, where appropriate, 5/17 patients with unilateral blocks and 1/11 with bilateral blocks successfully produced pregnancies.

"Autosomal dominant neovascular inflammatory vitreoretinopathy. Twenty-eight of 61 members of a six-generation family are affected by an autosomal dominant eye disease which has not been described previously. Affected patients are asymptomatic in early adulthood, but have vitreous cells and the selective loss of the b-wave on the electroretinogram. Later, peripheral retinal scarring and pigmentation, peripheral arteriolar closure, and neovascularization of the peripheral retina at the ora serrata or occasionally neovascularization of the optic disc develop. Cystoid macular edema, vitreous hemorrhage, tractional retinal detachment, and neovascular glaucoma can cause profound visual loss. Vitrectomy reduces traction on the retina and allows for retinal reattachment. The role of argon laser photocoagulation or cryopexy in reducing the neovascular complications remains uncertain. ",0
"Pharmacokinetics of tiaprofenic acid after oral administration in fasting patients during and between migraine attacks. This study examined the pharmacokinetics of 300 mg of tiaprofenic acid, a NSAID belonging to the 2-arylpropionic class, as a single oral dose, in 10 migraine patients during and out of migraine attacks. Plasma concentration of tiaprofenic acid was determined by HPLC analysis. Drug absorption appeared to be the same during and out of migraine attacks (absorption half life: during attack, 0.249 +/- 0.122 hr; out of attack, 0.249 +/- 0.105 hr; maximum plasma concentration: during attack, 37.8 +/- 9.8 ug/ml; out of attack, 40.1 +/- 13.2 ug/ml). The other pharmacokinetic parameters evaluated were not affected by headache attacks as well. We conclude that tiaprofenic acid absorption and metabolism are not affected by migraine attacks. Also, our data suggest that tiaprofenic acid might be useful in the treatment of migraine. ",0
"Progressive coma after the transsphenoidal decompression of a pituitary adenoma with marked suprasellar extension: report of two cases. Two cases of neurological deterioration and coma after the transsphenoidal decompression of a pituitary adenoma with marked suprasellar extension and invasion of the 3rd ventricle are presented. Emergency ventricular shunting led to prompt neurological improvement, which, supplemented by radiation therapy, allowed long-term amelioration of symptoms. Three possible explanations for this complication are offered: 1) traction of the attached 3rd ventricle into the decompression site, causing increased obstructive hydrocephalus, 2) vasopressin release by surgical manipulation of the pituitary stalk and circumventricular organs causing cerebral edema, and 3) edema in the residual tumor secondary to surgical manipulation causing further hydrocephalus. Subsequent patients with similar clinical and imaging criteria will have a planned perioperative ventricular shunting procedure performed. ",0
"DNA ploidy pattern in rectal carcinoid tumors. The nuclear DNA pattern of 22 rectal carcinoids was determined by cytophotometry of paraffin embedded tissues. The results were compared with clinical as well as histopathologic features of the tumor. Three of the carcinoids with synchronous or metachronous metastasis had aneuploid DNA pattern, whereas 19 tumors with no metastasis showed diploid DNA pattern. No other single clinical or pathologic feature of the tumor could predict more accurately the malignant potential and the subsequent course of the rectal carcinoid. It is concluded that DNA aneuploidy in rectal carcinoid tumors is not so rare as indicated by earlier studies and that it is a factor of significant prognostic value. ",0
"The prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in the Peoples Republic of China. Meta-analysis on data from 16 (two volunteer and 14 endoscopic) studies ahs been performed to investigate the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in the stomachs of individuals within the Peoples Republic of China. In this survey covering 2216 cases (89 volunteers and 2127 endoscopy patients), the incidence of H. pylori infection in 15- to 22-yr-old healthy volunteers, and in 13- to 88-yr-old symptomatic patients undergoing gastroscopy was 49.4% and 64.5%, respectively. The frequency of H. pylori infection in chronic gastritis (63.6%), gastric ulcer (71.9%), and duodenal ulcer disease (73.1%) differed significantly from that in histologically normal individuals (8.2%), confirming the relationship of H. pylori infection with those disease states. We found no significant association between H. pylori infection and symptoms. ",0
"Drop attacks with Meniere's syndrome. We report the clinical features of 12 patients with drop attacks associated with Meniere's syndrome. Each described a sensation of being pushed, thrown, or knocked to the ground or a sudden illusion of movement of the environment that led to a fall. These episodes were not accompanied by symptoms of their typical attacks of Meniere's syndrome. The drop attacks occurred early and late in the course of the disease; they were the initial manifestation in 1 patient. In the majority the episodes spontaneously remitted, although Meniere's syndrome continued to progress. These attacks probably result from a sudden mechanical deformation of the otolithic membrane of the utricle or saccule due to pressure gradients within the inner ear. They are important to recognize because their prognosis is relatively benign compared to other causes of drop attacks. ",0
"Fetal imaging in the skeletal dysplasias. Second-trimester diagnosis of fetal skeletal dysplasia is becoming increasingly common. By careful examination of the fetus for skeletal mineralization, shape and size of long bones and cranium, and abnormalities of other organ systems, a definitive diagnosis can often be achieved by ultrasound. Fetal radiography is very helpful in giving more information about bone shape and mineralization as well as in confirming the diagnosis. Subsequent obstetric management should be dictated by the natural history of the disease, the parents' wishes, and the gestational age at diagnosis. Because many of these disorders have a high recurrence risk, genetic counseling and follow-up are an important part of the management of these patients. ",0
"Code 9: a systematic approach for responding to medical emergencies occurring in and around a hospital. Members of the public expect to receive efficient and appropriate medical care if they become acutely ill or injured while in or around a hospital. Our institution became aware of the need for an organized system to respond to such emergencies involving patients, visitors, local community residents, and hospital employees, both inside the hospital and on the grounds surrounding the building. A search of the literature did not provide information regarding such a response; a survey of surrounding hospitals revealed no such plan in effect in other institutions. We therefore designed a plan to be superimposed onto our existing system for responding to in-house cardiac and respiratory arrests (""codes""). The results after one and one-half years appear encouraging. We recommend the establishment of such an emergency response system in all health care institutions. ",0
"Dexamethasone increases plasma levels of albendazole. Therapy of neurocysticercosis with cysticidal drugs is frequently complicated by the exacerbation of symptoms that follows the inflammation triggered by the acute destruction of cysticerci. Treatment of such adverse reactions with dexamethasone is highly effective. However, it has been shown that dexamethasone lowers the plasma levels of praziquantel, thus reducing its cysticidal efficacy. We measured plasma levels of albendazole, another strong cysticidal drug, when dexamethasone was given simultaneously. We found that dexamethasone increased the plasma levels of albendazole by about 50% (P less than 0.002); hence, it seems that cysticercosis and the ensuing inflammation can be treated simultaneously with albendazole and dexamethasone without diminishing the efficacy of the cysticidal drug.

"Clinical review 16: Parathyroid hormone-related proteins: coming of age in the 1990s. The last 3 yr have yielded a fertile harvest of new information on the HHM clinical syndrome and on the novel peptide hormone family responsible for the syndrome. Whereas the clinical riddle enshrouding the HHM syndrome first posed in the early 1940s appears to have been largely solved, a whole new field, concerning the physiological role(s) of PTHRP has opened. The field has evolved rapidly and provides an example of fruitful clinical investigation: the original problem was a clinical one (the HHM syndrome); understanding the clinical disorder led to pursuit of the problem in the laboratory (adenylate cyclase assays, protein purification, molecular cloning, PTHRP synthesis); and observations made in the laboratory have rapidly yielded clinical fruits (PTHRP immunoassays) and opened a new window on normal physiology.

"Acalculus lymphoeosinophilic cholecystitis associated with interleukin-2 and lymphokine-activated killer cell therapy. A case of unusual cholecystitis that developed on completion of interleukin-2 and lymphokine-activated killer cell therapy is described. A 62-year-old man was treated with interleukin-2 and lymphokine-activated killer cells for disseminated renal cell carcinoma. During the course of the immunotherapy, his serum alkaline phosphatase level increased, as did the peripheral eosinophil count (0.31). Subsequently, clinical and radiologic evidence of acute cholecystitis was noted. The removed gallbladder showed acalculus cholecystitis with extensive diffuse infiltrates of numerous eosinophils and T lymphocytes, but sparse polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The authors name this unusual cholecystitis acalculus lymphoeosinophilic cholecystitis and believe it to be associated with interleukin-2 and lymphokine-activated killer cell therapy. The pathogenic relationship is discussed. ",0
"Mutagen sensitivity in patients with head and neck cancers: a biologic marker for risk of multiple primary malignancies. Eighty-four patients with head and neck cancers were evaluated for in vitro sensitivity to mutagens and then followed longitudinally for development of multiple primary malignancies. We assessed mutagen sensitivity by exposing lymphocytes to bleomycin in vitro and quantitating the bleomycin-induced chromosomal breaks per cell. The mutagen-hypersensitive patients, ie, those who expressed greater than 1.0 break per cell, were significantly more likely to develop multiple primary cancers than were patients who were less sensitive (less than or equal to 1.0 break per cell) (relative risk = 4.4; 95% confidence limits = 1.2, 15.8). This relationship was independent of age, sex, site, and treatment of first primary cancer and tobacco or alcohol exposures. Sensitivity to bleomycin-induced chromosomal damage serves as an indicator of genetic susceptibility to multiple primary malignancies in patients with head and neck cancers. ",0
"Pseudotumor of the craniocervical junction during long-term hemodialysis. A systematic study of the upper cervical spine was performed using magnetic resonance imaging in 25 patients (15 men and 10 women) who had been undergoing hemodialysis for more than 10 years. Seven pseudotumors of the periodontoid soft tissue were disclosed, which were similar to the pannus recently described in rheumatoid arthritis. Bone cystic radiolucencies were observed in association with these pseudotumors in 5 patients. The radiolucencies were located in the atlas (1 in the lateral mass and 1 in the anterior branch) and in the axis (3 in the odontoid process and 1 in the vertebral body). No horizontal or vertical atlantoaxial subluxation was demonstrated. These features were observed only in patients who had amyloid arthropathy. They could be a frequent, yet thus far little-recognized, feature of beta 2-microglobulin amyloidosis. ",0
"Edwards' syndrome after the replacement of cryopreserved-thawed embryos. A case of Edwards' syndrome after the replacement of frozen-thawed embryos is reported. The presence of cardiac abnormalities and limb deformities raised the suspicion of chromosomal abnormality. The diagnosis of trisomy 18 was made by cytogenetic analysis of fetal blood from the umbilical vein. The chromosomal nondisjunction might have been spontaneous or because of freezing and thawing. If it occurred as a result of freezing and thawing, it is more likely that this was at the first cleavage division rather than the second meiotic division because the embryos were frozen at the late pronuclear stage. Unfortunately, there were no karyotypic markers in the couple's chromosomes to time the nondisjunction. The wisdom of using donor oocytes in an ovum donation program from patients with long-standing infertility is questioned. ",0
"Use of Mohs micrographic surgery to establish quantitative proof of heightened tumor spread in basal cell carcinoma recurrent following radiotherapy. We compared 27 basal-cell carcinomas (BCCs) recurrent following radiotherapy and subsequently excised by Mohs micrographic surgery to a control group of BCCs recurrent following other treatment modalities and similarly excised. Mohs technique permitted precise, quantitative tumor assessment, obtained via a novel method utilizing three parameters: the number of surgical stages required for complete excision, the percentage increase between clinical preoperative tumor area and final postoperative defect area, and the presence of deep subcutaneous tissue invasion. Figures for the postradiation group were larger in all three categories, with the latter two revealing statistically significant differences versus the nonradiation group. This study gives strong, direct quantitative support to the clinical impression that BCC recurrent following radiotherapy is a uniquely aggressive, invasive subset of recurrent BCC. ",0
"Critical review of gangliosides and thyrotropin-releasing hormone in peripheral neuromuscular diseases. The lack of effective therapy for many of the chronic neuromuscular diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, hereditary motor sensory neuropathy (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease), spinocerebellar degenerations and idiopathic polyneuropathy has led to a search for substances that may stimulate peripheral nerve regeneration. Two such agents that have been proposed are gangliosides (mixed purified bovine brain gangliosides, Cronassial) and thyrotropin releasing factor (TRH). Studies on both of these agents were initially reported with enthusiasm to be successful, but later double-blind controlled studies have failed to confirm these findings. This review provides critical analysis of the designs of studies of potentially effective agents in chronic neuromuscular diseases, and emphasizes the power of the placebo response, and the importance of designing placebos which are indistinguishable from the trial medication other than in the active effect.

"Sensitivity for detecting fibrillation potentials: a comparison between concentric and monopolar needle electrodes. The sensitivity of monopolar and concentric electrodes for detecting fibrillation potentials (FP) has never been formally compared. We studied 35 muscles with FP, sampling 20 sites each with concentric and monopolar needles. The concentric needle identified 0.88 +/- 3.44 (mean +/- standard deviation) more sites with spontaneous activity. Although statistically significant (Wilcoxon signed rank test P less than .03), this difference in sensitivity did not appreciably affect diagnostic interpretation. Subjects described the concentric needles as more painful. Needle insertions in 25 other muscles demonstrated that needle movement generated the majority of FP. We suggest that the increased tissue injury caused by concentric needles may account for both their increased sensitivity and discomfort. ",0
"Scrotal inflammatory disease: color Doppler US findings. A study of 45 patients with 51 cases of hemiscrotal inflammatory disease was done to determine the color Doppler ultrasonographic appearance of scrotal inflammatory disorders. The diagnosis was ultimately established by means of appropriate response to antibiotic treatment (47 cases) or surgery (four cases). In all cases, there was evidence of hyperemia: an increased number and concentration of detectable vessels in the affected portion of the scrotum. In 17 cases, the gray scale images were normal, and the only evidence of inflammation was the presence of hypervascularity. Abnormally decreased epididymal vascular resistance was detected in 14 cases of epididymitis; abnormally decreased testicular vascular resistance was detected in six cases of orchitis. Spontaneous venous flow was present in 18 patients. The authors conclude that color Doppler can demonstrate the hyperemic response to scrotal inflammatory disease and that, in the proper clinical setting, it can supplement the gray scale findings and increase diagnostic confidence.

"Multiple cranial nerve deficits after ethylene glycol poisoning. We report the cases of two patients who developed cranial nerve palsies after drinking ethylene glycol. A 33-year-old man developed multiple cranial nerve deficits nine days after the ingestion of ethylene glycol in a suicide attempt. Clinical findings included profound bilateral cranial nerve VII palsies and severe dysfunction of cranial nerves IX and X. The neuropathy occurred despite treatment with hemodialysis. The dysphagia completely cleared within two weeks, but at six months a severe bilateral cranial nerve VII dysfunction persisted. A 22-year-old man undergoing hemodialysis for ethylene glycol-induced renal failure developed bilateral cranial nerve VII dysfunction 14 days after ingestion. At a three-month follow-up, the patient demonstrated only moderate functional recovery. The etiology of the cranial nerve deficits is unknown but may be related to oxalate crystal deposition of ethylene glycol-induced pyridoxine dysfunction. ",0
"Manometric evaluation of jejunal limb after total gastrectomy and Roux-Orr anastomosis for gastric cancer. Total gastrectomy with Roux-Orr anastomosis is frequently performed for gastric cancer. Since intestinal motility of the Roux limb has never been evaluated after this operation, pressure activity was investigated in the Roux limb of ten patients (aged 51-77 years) who had undergone total gastrectomy and Roux-Orr reconstruction. Investigations were carried out during a 6-h fast and 3 h after a 605 kcal mixed meal. During fasting only two patients had activity fronts and these were abnormal. All ten patients displayed non-propagating bursts of contractions and three had discrete clustered contractions and high amplitude jejunal contractions. The fed state was characterized by a severely reduced motor activity pattern and other abnormalities. Total gastrectomy with Roux-Orr anastomoses provokes a relatively severe disturbance in intestinal activity. ",0
"Death by smothering and its investigation. This case report provides details from an extensive death investigation, the results of which led to the certification of suicidal manner of death by means of smothering in a pillow, without additional assistance from other persons or mechanical devices. This was the death of a chronically mentally ill person who was under currently approved professional treatment. Major investigative aspects of this case were the death-scene observations of the body, elimination of the possibility of homicide, and the study and analysis of the subject's psychiatric illness. Reasons for the uncommonness of reported deaths in this category are discussed. ",0
"Infertility and eating disorders. Sixty-six consecutive infertility clinic patients were prospectively screened with the 26-item Eating Attitudes Test and a study questionnaire. Women identified as being at high risk for an eating disorder were then interviewed to confirm or refute the diagnosis. A total of 7.6% of infertility clinic women were found to suffer from anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. If eating disorders not otherwise specified were included, a total of 16.7% of infertility patients were found to suffer from an eating disorder. Among infertile women with amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea 58% had eating disorders. Because women often fail to disclose eating disorders to their gynecologists and may appear to be of normal weight, it is recommended that a nutritional and eating disorder history be taken in infertility patients, particularly those with menstrual abnormalities. It has previously been shown that disorder eating and nutrition can affect menstruation, fertility, maternal weight gain, and fetal well-being. ",0
"Intrahepatic lymphatics opacified during hepatic arteriography in a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma. Extrahepatic lymph node metastases are not uncommon in advanced cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This is the account of a HCC case in which intrahepatic lymphatics running toward the hepatic hilus were clearly opacified during hepatic arteriography. The patient was treated by hepatic artery embolization followed by selective embolization of the portal branches, but lymph node metastases at the hepatic hilus were later found during follow-up. The clinical course of this case suggests that the communication between the tumor and the lymphatics was responsible for the lymph node metastasis. ",0
"Catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy in multiple endocrine neoplasia. A histologic, ultrastructural, and biochemical study. A catecholamine-induced dilated cardiomyopathy is reported in a patient with multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 3. A histologic and ultrastructural study has been undertaken in cardiac biopsy samples, together with determination of myocardial Ca++ and cellular membrane fatty acids. Contraction band necrosis of cardiocytes with supercontraction of sarcomeres progressing to myofibrolysis and increased levels of myocardial Ca++ have been found as morphologic and biochemical abnormalities, respectively. No lipoperoxidation of cellular membranes or an alpha-adrenergic mediated reduction of coronary supply could be recognized in the study. We indicate a receptor-mediated intracellular Ca++ overload as the main abnormality responsible for myocardial impairment. ",0
"Chronic rupture of the Achilles tendon: a new technique of repair. A new operative technique is described for the treatment of patients who have a rupture of the Achilles tendon. The large gap between the proximal and distal stumps of the Achilles tendon in seven patients was bridged by use of the tendon of the flexor digitorum longus as the graft. At the most recent follow-up examination (average follow-up, thirty-nine months; range, two to six years), the result was excellent or good in six patients and fair in one. Postoperatively, two patients needed an adjuvant procedure: one, a local rotation flap and the other, a split-thickness skin graft. Both patients had excellent restoration of function. The patient who had a fair result had a persistent limp and residual discomfort. There were no re-ruptures. ",0
"Clinical judgments in pain management. From research reports published over the last 20 years, it appears that moderate to severe uncontrolled pain may be the norm for hospitalized patients despite recent advances in the management of pain. Research on the extent of under-management of pain and the factors associated with it is examined and summarized in this paper. Methodological imperfections of the research are identified. Several explanations for pain under-management have been proposed and these are reported. A clinical decision making model is also reviewed and it is suggested that this model could be applied to pain management problems. Further, it is suggested that this model may be very useful in developing educational interventions to improve health practitioners' clinical skills in pain management. ",0
"Incarceration of colonoscope in an inguinal hernia. ""Pulley"" technique of removal. Because of its relative safety, colonoscopy has become an accepted diagnostic and therapeutic procedure in the evaluation of patients with colorectal disorders. Many unusual complications of colonoscopy have been described, but only anecdotal reports of hernial incarceration have been published. We present a case of a right-sided hernial incarceration of the colonoscope that would not permit reduction of the hernia nor removal of the instrument by conventional means. The mechanism of incarceration, which dictates the size of hernia at risk for incarceration, is explained. The ""pulley"" technique, which was used to remove the instrument without surgical intervention, is described. ",0
"Doppler ultrasonography of malignant melanomas of the uvea. Doppler shifts were detected using duplex and color Doppler scanning in 41 of 42 patients with malignant melanomas of the uvea. Mean maximum tumor systolic velocity was 18.8 +/- 7.6 cm/s. Time-averaged maximum velocity in the tumor vessels was 12.3 +/- 5.3 cm/s. Maximum tumor velocity increased in four of eight tumors and was unchanged or had diminished in the other four 2 to 3 days after ruthenium plaque irradiation. Doppler shifts were undetectable in three tumors, markedly reduced in three tumors, and unchanged in one tumor 1 to 4 months after treatment. We detected minimal non-pulse-synchronized Doppler shifts in one of three tumors, and no shifts in the remaining two tumors 1 1/2 to 4 years after therapy. Color duplex scanning allowed a rapid overview of tumor vasculature and facilitated study of individual vessels. ",0
"Primary intramedullary nailing of open femoral shaft fractures. The cases of 60 patients with 63 open femoral fractures treated by primary reamed intramedullary nailing were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-two were classified as Type I open fractures, 26 as Type II and 15 as Type III open fractures by Gustilo's classification. All fractures were treated by wound debridement followed by immediate reamed intramedullary nailing. There were five early soft-tissue infections and three late deep infections. Of the late infections, only one was osteomyelitis (1.6%). There were three nonunions and seven malunions. All of the complications were dealt with effectively by standard methods. We concluded that primary reamed intramedullary nailing is an effective alternative for the treatment of Type I and II open femur fractures and for Type III open femur fractures associated with multiple trauma.

"Clinical results of axillobifemoral bypass using externally supported polytetrafluoroethylene Seventy-six axillobifemoral grafts with externally supported polytetrafluoroethylene prostheses were performed since 1983. The indications for operation were absolute (aortic sepsis) in 20 (26%) patients and relative (excessive operative risk or technical difficulty) in 56 (74%) patients. The life-table primary patency for these operations at 4 years follow-up (mean follow-up, 2 years, 4 months) was 85%. We conclude that the patency results achieved in this patient series are sufficiently satisfactory to warrant use of axillobifemoral grafts in an expanded number of patients with high operative risk and need for bypass of aortoiliac occlusive disease.

"Hypertension and acculturation in elderly Mexican Americans: results from 1982-84 Hispanic HANES. The purpose of our study was to describe the relationship between acculturation and hypertension in elderly Mexican Americans. Two age groups, 55-64 and 65-74, were examined from data provided in the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES). The prevalence of hypertension among subgroups of different acculturation was ascertained based on the modified Cuellar Acculturation Scale. Each age group was also stratified using the HHANES poverty index, with those above the index compared to those below. A stepwise logistic regression was performed among the variables of poverty, gender, age, and acculturation in relation to hypertension. The results indicate that acculturation and age are stronger predictors of hypertension than poverty in elderly Mexican Americans, with acculturation being a stronger predictor among those age 55-64. Factors related to acculturation may have a stronger influence on the prevalence of hypertension in older Mexican Americans than differences related to socioeconomic status. ",0
"Role of oxygen free radicals in ischemic and reperfused myocardium. In recent years there has been considerable interest concerning the role of oxygen radicals in myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury. The sequential univalent reduction of oxygen gives rise to very reactive intermediate products. Normally, the tissue concentration of these intermediate products of oxygen is limited and the aerobic myocardium survives because of the existence of a delicate balance between the generation of the various oxidants and the maintenance of the antioxidant defense mechanism. Several possible sources have been identified for the production of active oxygen species after ischemia and reperfusion and these sources may be mutually interactive. The ability of scavengers of oxygen free radicals, including vitamin E, to improve mechanical, mitochondrial, and sarcoplasmic reticulum function in animal models of ischemic-reperfusion injury also suggests that oxygen free radicals are partly responsible for myocardial damage in these models, although caution in the interpretation of these data is necessary.

"The human costs of cancer and the response of the National Cancer Program. The three foundations of the National Cancer Program are basic research, clinical trials (in prevention and treatment), and cancer centers. These foundations have supported a great deal of progress against cancer over the past 20 years. Nevertheless, a number of challenges remain, and continued progress will depend on the speed with which research advances can be translated into practical realities. Poverty is a risk factor for cancer incidence and mortality. Thus, a lack of access to the technologies generated by the National Cancer Program can be a force for bringing about differential burdens of cancer in underserved populations. ",0
"Femur fracture with limb shortening causing occlusion of a polytetrafluoroethylene femoral popliteal graft. Traumatic occlusion of lower extremity polytetrafluoroethylene arterial grafts is exceedingly rare. We report a patient who suffered a supracondylar femur fracture resulting in shortening of her right lower extremity with kinking and thrombosis of her above-knee polytetrafluoroethylene arterial graft. This is the first report in the English language of prosthetic graft occlusion as a result of traumatic limb shortening. The graft thrombus was successfully lysed by use of intraarterial urokinase, and the kink was repaired by graft resection and reanastomosis. The mechanism of injury and treatment are discussed. ",0
"Cardiac pathology in 470 consecutive forensic autopsies. Cardiovascular disease continues to be the single most common generic cause of sudden and unexpected deaths. Atherosclerotic coronary heart disease and acute myocardial infarction are the most prevalent forms of fatal cardiac disease observed at autopsy. Other cardiac lesions are frequently listed as causes of death, but the prevalence of such lesions as incidental findings in the general population is unknown. In this study, 470 consecutive forensic autopsies were evaluated for minor and major anomalies. The most frequently observed major congenital finding was floppy mitral valve (5%). Tunneled coronary arteries, considered minor congenital findings, were seen in 29%. Atherosclerotic coronary heart disease was the most common major acquired finding, observed in 16% of cases. Of the 470 hearts, only 8% were considered normal. ",0
"Natural death as viewed by the medical examiner: a review of 1000 consecutive autopsies of individuals dying of natural disease. A study of 1000 consecutive autopsies of individuals dying of natural disease was conducted. Cardiovascular disease was responsible for 60.9% of all deaths with coronary artery disease--not only the main cause of cardiovascular death but also the main cause of all natural deaths--accounting for 45.1% of such cases. Diseases of the central nervous and respiratory systems accounted for 8.7 and 8.6%, respectively, of the natural deaths. Seizure disorders and pneumonia were the main causes of death in these organ systems. There were 124 deaths of children less than one year in age, 91 of which were due to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). All of the SIDS deaths were in children less than 10 months old. ",0
"Malignant melanoma of the biliary tract: a case report. A 58-year-old man was seen with obstructive jaundice and discomfort in the upper abdomen. Computed tomographic and ultrasound examinations revealed a soft-tissue mass in the gallbladder. Cholecystectomy and choledochotomy revealed a soft black mass in the gallbladder and a second one in the intrapancreatic portion of the common bile duct. Each was diagnosed as malignant melanoma. Subsequently, a Whipple resection of the pancreas, duodenum, and distal bile duct revealed a melanoma circumferentially invading and obstructing the distal common duct. No lymph node or distant metastasis was identified. Repetitive searches for another primary site have been negative. The tumor apparently originated in the biliary tract. The patient remains almost well 2 years after diagnosis. ",0
"Bladder function in the mentally retarded. A group of 21 mentally retarded patients with severe, long-standing urinary symptoms underwent urodynamical investigation. The most common abnormalities were detrusor areflexia and detrusor hyper-reflexia. Of 11 patients treated surgically, 10 derived marked benefit. Drugs were successful in reducing micturition problems in 3/6 patients. Severely retarded patients with spastic quadriplegia are difficult to investigate and if this is associated with detrusor hyper-reflexia it is impossible to treat them in any way. Severely retarded patients with detrusor areflexia and infrequent voiding can benefit from bladder outlet surgery. Patients with moderate (especially mild) retardation can be investigated and treated in the same way as non-retarded people. ",0
"Immunophenotyping in the management of gastric lymphoma. Primary gastric lymphoma is a rare tumor in which surgical resection plays a major role in improving the response rate and reducing the incidence of bleeding and perforation after chemotherapy. In 17 consecutive patients, the diagnosis of gastric lymphoma was made by immunophenotyping snap-frozen endoscopic biopsy specimens. All neoplasms were B-cell lymphomas. Pan B surface marker antigens were present in all patients. Levels of Ki-67, a nuclear marker of tumor proliferation, were greater than 45% in two of the four patients who died after progression of their lymphoma. All patients alive had Ki-67 levels of less than 30%. A lower proliferation index, as measured by Ki-67, appears to be associated with better prognosis. Ten of 11 patients treated by resection prior to chemotherapy had no complications. Immunophenotyping is the key in the differential diagnosis when considering malignant lymphoma with gastric carcinoma and benign conditions such as pseudolymphoma. ",0
"Dapsone is an effective therapy for the skin lesions of subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus and urticarial vasculitis in a patient with C2 deficiency. The deficiency of second component of complement (C2d) is the most common hereditary complement deficiency. Patients with C2 deficiency are frequently associated with an auto-immune disease process, in particular, systemic lupus erythematosus (LE)-like syndrome and/or vasculitic syndrome or bacterial infections. C2d has been associated with the LE subset of subacute cutaneous LE (SCLE), the presence of anti-Ro (SSA) antibodies, and the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types A10, B18, DR2. We describe the clinical, serologic and immunogenetic data in a patient with manifestations of Sjogren's syndrome who developed urticarial vasculitis and photosensitive annular SCLE which were effectively treated with oral dapsone. Our case illustrates the dynamic nature of LE. ",0
"Gastric lesions secondary to long-distance running. Gastrointestinal disorders have been reported during long-distance running. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of prolonged exercise on the upper digestive tract. Seven subjects were submitted to a standard endoscopic examination of the upper digestive tract before and after long-distance running (range 18-50 km). Mucosal biopsy specimens were taken during all endoscopies. After running, all runners had histologically pathological features in the stomach. Vascular lesions were present in the chorion in six subjects after running, with the intensity of the lesions ranging from congestion to hemorrhage. Postexercise histological examination also showed a decrease in mucosal secretion. These lesions secondary to prolonged exercise indicate the presence of hemodynamic perturbations in the upper digestive tract. ",0
"Neuroendocrine carcinoid tumours of the breast: a variant of carcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation. Carcinoid tumours most frequently develop in the gastrointestinal tract but have been described in many organs of the body. In 1977 the first cases were reported in the mamma, followed by descriptions of argyrophilic carcinoid-like, neuroendocrine mammary tumours by many investigators who performed immunohistochemical and ultrastructural examinations. The existence of true carcinoids in the mamma is still a controversial issue. Eight mammary neoplasms with monomorphous cytonuclear features, five of the small cell carcinoid-like variety and three composed of larger cells, were examined by immunohistochemical and ultrastructural examination. We believe this kind of tumours are ductal or lobular carcinomas with focal or more extensive neuroendocrine features and are the result of a dual differentiation of neoplastic precursor stem cells along epithelial and endocrine lines. Consequently, we consider that treatment of such cases should not be different from that of the ordinary type of mammary carcinomas. ",0
"The risk of large bowel cancer after partial gastrectomy for benign ulcer disease. The relative risk (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] for colorectal cancer after partial gastrectomy for ulcer disease was examined in a population-based cohort comprising 6459 patients operated during 1950 to 1958. Follow-up through 1983 revealed 131 cases of colorectal cancer versus 150.3 expected cases (SIR = 0.87; 95% confidence limits 0.73, 1.03). The relative risk was decreased during the first 19 years of follow-up (SIR = 0.75; 0.58, 0.96) and close to equal thereafter (SIR = 1.02; 0.79, 1.29). Sex, age at operation, type of operation, and diagnosis at operation (stomach or duodenal ulcer) did not affect the relative risk significantly. Confounding by socioeconomic status is one conceivable explanation for the decreased relative risk during the first years of follow-up, whereas the increasing risk with longer duration of follow-up might be a consequence of the surgical procedure itself.

"Cardiac arrest during hip arthroplasty with a cemented long-stem component. A report of seven cases. Seven patients had a cardiac arrest during hip arthroplasty with a cemented long-stem femoral component. Four patients died in the operating room, and three patients were successfully resuscitated. When the three survivors were eventually discharged from the hospital, they had no known permanent cardiac, pulmonary, or neurological sequelae. Factors that were common to all of the patients were advanced age, osteoporotic bone, a previously undisturbed intramedullary canal, and use of a long-stem femoral component and several batches of methylmethacrylate. Hip arthroplasty with a long-stem femoral component is associated with substantial risk in these patients. Excessive pressurization of cement should be avoided, and invasive hemodynamic monitoring should be used when the described conditions are present. ",0
"Early magnetic resonance imaging in acute traumatic internuclear ophthalmoplegia. Adduction deficiency following acute head trauma may result not only from orbital damage but also from internuclear ophthalmoplegia, and in most instances this resolves over weeks to months. To date, noninvasive imaging studies during the acute phase following injury have not been definitive in localizing the pathology. Three cases of adduction deficiency following head trauma that were caused by internuclear ophthalmoplegia are reported. A lesion in the brain stem was found in all three cases by magnetic resonance imaging in the subacute post-traumatic period. These lesions were not visible on routine x-ray computed tomography obtained at the time of injury. ",0
"A study of the comparative efficacy of four common analgesics in the control of postsurgical dental pain. Four common oral analgesics were tested in a single-blind trial to determine their relative efficacy in the management of postsurgical pain in 103 patients who had their impacted third molars surgically removed under general anesthesia. The analgesics tested were acetylsalicylic acid (26 patients), ibuprofen (26 patients), a paracetamol/codeine/caffeine combination (Solpadeine) (25 patients), and dihydrocodeine (26 patients). The paracetamol/codeine/caffeine combination, ibuprofen, and acetylsalicylic acid preparations produced equally effective analgesia. Dihydrocodeine was found to be a poor analgesic in this pain model. There were no adverse reactions to any of the preparations. ",0
"Partial duplication of the face: case report and review. Complete or partial facial duplication is a rare congenital malformation. A spectrum of structural abnormalities varying in degrees of severity has been described in affected individuals. We present discordance for facial duplication between monozygotic twins in which maxillary and mandibular duplication was present in one. The involved twin showed the following findings: ocular hypertelorism, bifidity of the nose, duplication of the maxilla, macrostomia, cleft of the lower lip, hamartoma of the vomer, supernumerary teeth, duplication of the mandibular teeth, bifidity of the tongue, and hamartoma of the floor of the mouth. Surgical management of the facial anomalies is discussed. A review of the literature and discussion of this rare malformation are presented. ",0
"Tryptophan-induced eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome Eight patients who became ill while taking tryptophan had myalgia, fatigue, rash, fever, edema, alopecia, arthralgias, diminished joint motion, skin tightening, muscle cramping, and distal paresthesias. Three had shortness of breath, and one had pulmonary hypertension. Laboratory abnormalities included peripheral eosinophilia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and elevated serum levels of aldolase, lactate dehydrogenase, and liver enzymes. Of 4 chest radiographs, 3 were abnormal. Of 5 skin and muscle biopsies, 4 showed sclerosis or mixed inflammatory cell infiltration of the dermis, subcutis, and fascia. Eosinophils were often present, but vasculitis was absent. Muscle inflammation was minimal. We conclude that the ""eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome"" is related to the ingestion of tryptophan and that abnormalities in the secretion of lymphokines may be important in its pathogenesis. ",0
"Amiloride blocks the onset of ACTH-induced hypertension in the sheep. This study investigated the ability of two diuretics, amiloride and frusemide, to prevent the development of ACTH induced hypertension in conscious sheep. Infusion of amiloride (20 mg/day) or frusemide (50 mg/day) for three days into normotensive sheep did not have any significant effects on blood pressure. Amiloride blocked ACTH-induced hypertension and the sodium retention and hypokalemia which is usually associated with ACTH administration. Frusemide failed to completely block the hypertension and potassium loss, however it blocked the transient initial urinary sodium retention associated with ACTH-induced hypertension. As frusemide failed to completely block the hypertension it is unlikely that the amiloride effect is due primarily to effects on urinary Na excretion. It is possible that amiloride is exerting its antihypertensive effects by blocking sodium channels. ",0
"Imaging the fetal brain in the second and third trimesters using transvaginal sonography. High-frequency transvaginal probes were used at 20-40 weeks' gestation to develop a systematic examination of the fetal brain. Modeling the procedure after the standard neonatal neurosonographic examination, we attempted to obtain three coronal sections (anterior, midline, posterior) and two sagittal sections (midsagittal, right or left parasagittal). In 70 normal patients, all planes were imaged with a similar frequency (74-76%) except for the posterior coronal plane, which was imaged 59% of the time. Among the first 35 cases, 17% had a complete study, compared with 71% of the second 35 cases. Transvaginal sonography established or changed the diagnosis in five of the 13 cases with central nervous system or other abnormalities. We recommend that a complete fetal neurosonographic examination include transvaginal sonography to complement and enhance the transabdominal examination, especially for cases in which a fetal abnormality is suspected.

"Tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesions of the head and neck. The term 'tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesion' has been used to describe a fibrosclerosing disorder which has a locally destructive nature but is characterized by a benign histological appearance. We report five patients, over a five year period, with such a lesion. The clinical behaviour and surgical findings suggest the lesion to be an invasive malignancy. However, the histological appearance of an admixture of chronic inflammatory cells and fibrosis is consistent with a benign condition. We recommend surgical excision of the lesion as the mainstay of treatment; other studies report the use of steroids and radiotherapy. ",0
"Isolated lung transplantation for pulmonary fibrosis. The peri-operative anaesthetic management of 11 patients with pulmonary fibrosis undergoing single-lung transplantation is presented. Intra-operative problems, the early postoperative phase of recovery and intensive care, and other incidents in which general anaesthesia was required for the management of complications, are featured. Results, both short- and long-term, are mentioned. Major intra-operative events that cause concern appear to be related to the severity of the presenting illness and the development of respiratory failure. Others have reported the development of intra-operative cardiac failure. All cases were successfully managed operatively using conventional one-lung anaesthesia, although resort to partial cardiopulmonary bypass may have been indicated in some. The indications and attitudes to utilising cardiopulmonary bypass in the evolution of techniques for facilitating single-lung transplantation are reviewed. ",0
"Empiric treatment of fungal infections in the neutropenic host. Review of the literature and guidelines for use. Persistent fever that is refractory to broad-spectrum antibacterials is common in neutropenic patients undergoing induction chemotherapy of acute leukemia. Clinical experience suggests that many of these patients are infected with fungi. Until recently, data supporting the role of empiric antifungal therapy in this setting were limited to small groups of patients or postmortem reports. Evolving evidence in larger patient populations supports data from smaller series: febrile neutropenic patients who have failed to respond to a 4- to 7-day course of broad-spectrum antibacterials may benefit from the early initiation of antifungal therapy. Patients with fungal colonization or pulmonary infiltrates and adult patients who have not received previous fungal prophylaxis may especially benefit from the early use of antifungal drugs. Amphotericin B has been the ""gold standard"" for empiric antifungal therapy, although the newer azoles may be useful in certain situations. ",0
"Association of Treacher Collins syndrome and translocation 6p21.31/16p13.11: exclusion of the locus from these candidate regions. Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS) is an autosomal dominant defect of craniofacial development which has not been chromosomally localized. We have identified a mother and two children who have TCS and also a balanced translocation t(6;16)(p21.31;p13.11), which suggested the possibility that the TCS locus might be located at one of the translocation breakpoints. These were defined by in-situ hybridization as 6p21.31 (by using loci in the HLA complex defined by the probes p45.1DP beta 003/HLA-DPB2 and pRS5.10/HLA class I chain) and 16p13.11 (by using probes pACHF1.3.2/D16S8 and VK45/D16S131). Pairwise and multipoint linkage analysis using localized chromosome 6 probes and chromosome 16 probes in 12 unrelated TCS families with multiple affected siblings excluded the TCS locus from proximity to both translocation breakpoints. These data were confirmed when a third affected child, who did not exhibit the translocation, was born to the mother. ",0
"The role of antihistamine therapy in vascular headaches. Migraine (vascular) headache is a complex syndrome that involves vascular hyperreactivity. The functions of systemic mediators in migraine are not fully understood. It is unclear which mediators provoke this probably atopic disorder and which represent an attempt to correct an imbalance. However, it has been demonstrated fairly conclusively that increased histamine levels correlate with migraine attacks in susceptible persons. Recent studies showing that histamine seems to have many different receptors and to adopt different conformations for different receptors may serve as a useful guide to future scientific investigation. Further impetus may come from ongoing studies of H3 histamine receptors, which indicate that H3 agonists offer promise as prophylactic agents for people who suffer from vascular headaches. ",0
"The value of push-type jejunal endoscopy in familial adenomatosis coli/Gardner's syndrome. Push-type jejunal endoscopy using a long forward-viewing duodenofiberscope was performed in 10 patients with familial adenomatosis coli/Gardner's syndrome. Jejunal polypoid lesions were detected in nine of the 10 patients (90%). The lesions appeared sessile, whitish, and measured 3 mm or less in diameter. Histologic findings of the biopsy specimens from these polypoid lesions revealed tubular adenoma in all nine patients. In addition, this method led to the detection of duodenal adenomas in one patient, in whom duodenofiberscopy with the side-viewing instrument revealed no polypoid lesions in the bulb and second portion of the duodenum. In view of these results, we recommend that push-type jejunal endoscopy, as well as side-viewing duodenofiberscopy, should be added to the usual preoperative examinations done in patients with this disease.

"Uniparental paternal disomy in Angelman's syndrome. Angelman's syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome are both causes of mental retardation with recognisable, but quite different, clinical phenotypes. Both are associated with deletions of chromosome 15q11-13, of maternal origin in Angelman's and paternal in Prader-Willi. Prader-Willi can arise by inheritance of two chromosomes 15 from the mother and none from the father (uniparental maternal disomy). In 2 patients with Angelman's syndrome we found evidence of uniparental paternal disomy. The phenotypic effects of maternal and paternal disomy of chromosome 15 are very different and inheritance of two normal 15s from one parent does not lead to normal development--strong evidence in man for genomic imprinting, in which the same gene has different effects dependent upon its parental origin.

"Primary orchiectomy versus estrogen therapy in advanced prostatic cancer--a randomized study: results after 7 to 10 years of followup. Of 163 new consecutively diagnosed cases of advanced (T3-4 M0 or T04M1) prostatic cancer 13 had contraindications for estrogen treatment, and the remainder were randomized to orchiectomy (76) or to estrogen treatment (74), consisting of 150 micrograms ethinyl estradiol daily and 80 mg. polyestradiol monthly. During the followup period of 7 to 10 years disease progression was noted in 27 patients (36%) treated with estrogen and 39 (51%) orchiectomized patients. The free of progression survival rate was significantly better (less than 0.05) among the estrogen treated patients but the over-all survival rates after orchiectomy and estrogen treatment were almost identical. A significantly higher frequency of cardiovascular side effects was noted in the estrogen group (23 cases) compared to the orchiectomy group (4 cases). Therefore, estrogen treatment in this form cannot be recommended for the palliative treatment of prostate cancer. ",0
"CD34 antigen expression in children with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. One characteristic of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph')-positive acute leukemia is the occasional presence of both lymphoid and myeloid features in the same leukemia. This phenomenon supports the theory that this subtype of acute leukemia arises from lymphoid-myeloid stem cell, pluripotent progenitors. Very few reports, however, describe the immunophenotype, especially CD34 antigen, of Ph'-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). It has been shown that CD34, the human progenitor cell antigen, is found on 1% or less of normal human bone marrow cells, approximately 30% of acute leukemias, and multipotent progenitor cells; CD34 is not found on normal peripheral blood cells. A high frequency of CD34 expression was found in children with Ph'-positive ALL: CD34 was positive for all six patients tested, and one had an acute mixed-lineage leukemia. These findings suggest the involvement of a pluripotent stem cell in Ph'-positive ALL. ",0
"Transient entrapment neuropathy of the posterior interosseous nerve in violin players. Eleven white male right handed violin players complained of transient muscular deficit of the extensor compartment of the left forearm during and after prolonged playing. This was associated with paraesthesiae and pain. Relief was achieved keeping the wrist and the elbow flexed, with the supinated forearm held by the contralateral hand. An anatomical study showed changes of the relationship of the posterior interosseous nerve with its surrounding structures with pronation and supination of the forearm. On the basis of the clinical features, the anatomical studies and the response to a simple physiotherapeutic regime, it is suggested that prolonged pronation of the forearm may cause transient entrapment of the nerve.

"Ondansetron: a new entity in emesis control. Nausea and vomiting are serious problems for patients receiving cancer chemotherapy. Dopamine receptor and cholinergic receptor antagonism have been the target mechanism for agents used to combat drug-induced nausea and vomiting; more recently, blockade of serotonin receptors has been used for this indication. Current therapies are limited by extrapyramidal adverse effects, as well as drowsiness, sedation, respiratory depression, and cardiac effects. Ondansetron is an investigational serotonin antagonist that has documented effectiveness for cancer chemotherapy-induced emesis. Ondansetron appears to be well tolerated, with the possible exception of headaches and transient increases in liver enzymes. No extrapyramidal toxicities have been reported with this agent. While ondansetron looks promising, further studies are needed to fully define its role as an antiemetic. ",0
"Protective role of vitamin E in biological systems. Vitamin E is well accepted as nature's most effective lipid-soluble, chain-breaking antioxidant, protecting cell membranes from peroxidative damage. Free-radical-mediated pathology has been implicated in the development over time of degenerative diseases and conditions. This paper reviews the current research on the protective role and requirements for vitamin E and the other antioxidants in preventing or minimizing free-radical damage associated with specific diseases and lifestyle patterns and processes, including cancer, aging, circulatory conditions, arthritis, cataract, pollution, and strenuous exercise. While awaiting results of further human studies, research evidence suggests that an adequate intake of vitamin E and the other antioxidants can provide protection from the increasingly high free-radical concentrations caused by air pollutants and current lifestyle patterns.

"Intravenous immunoglobulin treatment in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. Clinical and laboratory characteristics associated with improvement. Of 52 patients fulfilling the criteria of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, 20 (38%) did not improve after intravenous immunoglobulin treatment, two (4%) had a short-lasting improvement and subsequent infusions had no effect, nine (17%) reached a spontaneously or therapeutically induced complete remission, and 21 patients (40%) needed intermittent infusions to maintain improvement. All patients who improved initially had symptoms that significantly interfered with life-style. After treatment, 90% of these patients were independent in their daily activities. Significantly associated with improvement were disease duration of less than 1 year, progression of weakness until treatment, absence of discrepancy in weakness between arms and legs, areflexia of the arms, and slowed nerve conduction velocity of the motor median nerve. The probability of improvement if all these features are present in 93%. ",0
"Interventional radiologic alternatives to cholecystectomy. It has been estimated that 20 million people in the United States have gallstone disease. The choice of the optimal management strategy for a patient with symptomatic gallstones in the 1990s will take into account the clinical status of the patient, the characteristics of the gallstones, and the patient's preference. Only patients whose doctors understand the advantages and disadvantages of the newer methods can make properly informed choices. When interventional radiologic alternatives to cholecystectomy are being contemplated, one approach is to first consider the patient's clinical presentation (acute or nonacute) and then their risk of death after cholecystectomy (low or high). Figure 5 shows an algorithmic approach to the management of gallbladder stones based on this concept. This algorithm also can be used as a framework for discussion of treatment options with any individual patient. ",0
"Short-term memory and sentence comprehension. An investigation of a patient with crossed aphasia. The relationship between short-term memory impairment and sentence comprehension is explored in a right-handed patient with a focal temporoparietal lesion of the right hemisphere. The general clinical profile, as well as characteristics of the patient's immediate memory for word lists, suggests the occurrence of a 'mirror image' crossed aphasia. Detailed analysis of the patient's ability to repeat and to comprehend sentences, however, indicates some important differences between this case and previously reported patients with short-term memory impairment. It is suggested that these differences, which may be related to an unusual pattern of neuroanatomical organization of cognitive functions, involve symptom dissociations with implications for models of normal language/memory interactions.

"Primary osteosarcoma of the lung. Report of two cases and review of the literature. Two cases of primary osteosarcoma of the lung are presented. In one case, the radiologic, clinical, and cytologic findings led to a preoperative diagnosis of undifferentiated carcinoma of the lung. In the second case, a lung nodule was discovered during postchemotherapy follow-up in a patient with lymphoma. Fine needle aspiration in the second case showed lymphoma, and further chemotherapy was instituted; however, persistent growth of the nodule prompted a resection. Microscopic examination of the resected tumors in both cases revealed histologic features of high-grade osteosarcoma. Flow cytometric analyses of the primary tumors showed abnormal hyperdiploid deoxyribonucleic acid populations in accordance with those seen in high-grade malignant neoplasms. Immunohistochemical studies supported a mesenchymal origin for these tumors. These tumors shared clinical features with other reported cases of primary osteosarcoma of the lung such as large size at diagnosis, occurrence in older individuals, and aggressive behavior. ",0
"Diphenylhydantoin-induced hypogammaglobulinemia in a patient infected with human immunodeficiency virus. A case is reported of reversible panhypogammaglobulinemia in a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patient. Onset and resolution were temporally correlated with initiation and termination, respectively, of diphenylhydantoin therapy for a possible seizure. A rapid alteration in peripheral T-cell subpopulations was also noted in association with diphenylhydantoin administration. This case is compared with previous reports of diphenylhydantoin-associated hypogammaglobulinemia in non-HIV-infected patients. In addition, the case is discussed with regard to possible deleterious effects associated with the use of diphenylhydantoin as therapy for HIV-associated seizures or as an antiretroviral agent in HIV disease.

"Pelvic pain: lessons from anatomy and physiology. Pelvic pain is often a difficult differential diagnosis in the emergency department. For physiologic reasons, pain in the pelvis is difficult to localize to a specific organ, and pelvic peritonitis is hard to recognize. On the other hand, differences in types of pain can be very useful in arriving at a correct diagnosis. The clinician must learn to recognize superficial and deep somatic pain, and differentiate between various types of visceral pain which originate from inflammation, ischemia, or colic. A review of the anatomy and physiology of pelvic pain helps identify some of the problems as well as potential aids in approaching the patient with pelvic pain. ",0
"Dietary management of acute childhood diarrhea: optimal timing of feeding and appropriate use of milks and mixed diets. Several recent clinical trials have examined the optimal timing of feeding and the appropriate foods for use in the dietary management of acute childhood diarrhea. Important methodologic issues relevant to these trials, such as the composition and masking of study diets, measurement of outcome variables, and assessment of nutritional status, are discussed. Available data suggest that feeding should be continued during diarrhea, although a small subgroup of patients receiving nonhuman milk exclusively may have an excess rate of complications. These children should be closely supervised or provided with alternative diets. By contrast, children receiving human milk, nonmilk formulas, and mixed diets are generally able to tolerate these foods and to benefit nutritionally from continued feeding. ",0
Small bowel phytobezoar mimicking presentation of Crohn's disease. A case of small bowel phytobezoar formed from unusual ingested vegetation is described. The patient presented with recurrent subacute obstruction and a right iliac fossa mass mimicking the presentation of Crohn's disease. None of the usual gastrointestinal disorders that predispose to bezoar formation were present. The phytobezoar passed spontaneously following small bowel enema and colonoscopy. It is possible that relaxation of the gut secondary to the antispasmodics administered at investigation or the physical disturbance during these procedures enabled migration through the ileocecal valve. Antispasmodics may be of use in the conservative management of bezoars obstructing otherwise normal bowel. ,0
"Child care practices with respect to acute respiratory tract infection in a poor, urban community in Nigeria. A longitudinal study conducted over a 3-year period in a poor, urban community in Nigeria, a developing country, found that acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) was common, in particular among infants and boys. Between 81% and 95% of the children treated for ARI over the 3-year period were brought to the clinic by their mothers. About 32% of these children had been treated with cough medicines, 42% with antipyretics, 5% with antibiotics, and 10% with hematinics before they were brought to the clinic. The source of such medications included medicines left over from previous prescriptions and those bought from chemists' shops and street vendors. Up to 64% of the children treated for ARI had been force-fed local herbal teas by their mothers; herbal teas were used for both preventive and curative purposes. ",0
"Pathogenesis of antigen-induced arthritis in mice deficient in neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G. The contribution of neutrophil-derived elastase and cathepsin G to joint pathology has been examined in immune arthritis in the mouse. Neutrophils from beige mice are genetically deficient in lysosomal elastase and cathepsin G, but have normal levels of the acid hydrolases, beta-glucuronidase, and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase. The development of antigen-induced arthritis in normal mice has been compared with that in beige mice. The pattern of synovitis (both leukocyte accumulation and plasma leakage) were indistinguishable in normal and beige mice. Cartilage proteoglycan depletion was quantified by measuring the decrease in safranin O staining intensity, and this, too, was unaltered in mice lacking elastase and cathepsin G. These results suggest that neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G do not contribute to these aspects of joint pathology in antigen-induced arthritis in the mouse. ",0
"Prospective payment system and impairment at discharge. The 'quicker-and-sicker' story revisited Since the introduction of the prospective payment system (PPS), anecdotal evidence has accumulated that patients are leaving the hospital ""quicker and sicker."" We developed valid measures of discharge impairment and measured these levels in a nationally representative sample of patients with one of five conditions prior to and following the PPS implementation. Instability at discharge (important clinical problems usually first occurring prior to discharge) predicted the likelihood of postdischarge deaths. At 90 days postdischarge, 16% of patients discharged unstable were dead vs 10% of patients discharged stable. After the PPS introduction, instability increased primarily among patients discharged home. Prior to the PPS, 10% of patients discharged home were unstable; after the PPS was implemented, 15% were discharged unstable, a 43% relative change. Efforts to monitor the effect of this increase in discharge instability on health should be implemented. ",0
"Flow cytometric DNA content of adenoid cystic carcinoma of submandibular gland. Correlation of histologic features and prognosis. Flow cytometric analysis of nuclear DNA content was performed in 26 adenoid cystic carcinomas of the submandibular gland using archived, paraffin-embedded tissues. The DNA content was compared with multiple histologic parameters and clinical course. Ten carcinomas (38%) were aneuploid and 16 (62%) diploid. Aneuploid carcinomas demonstrated a higher frequency of solid cytoarchitecture, lymph node metastases, and advanced clinical stage, as compared with diploid carcinomas. Other histologic features predicting aggressive clinical behavior also correlated with abnormal DNA content and included invasion of nerves larger than 0.25 mm and intravascular extension. Our data suggest that DNA content analysis can be an effective objective parameter in the clinicopathologic assessment of adenoid cystic carcinoma. ",0
"Compressive neuropathy of spinal nerve roots. A mechanical or biological problem? Pathophysiologically, nerve root pain production is a complex issue. For many years, mechanical compression has been regarded as the sole cause for such pain. There are indications, however, that other factors, such as intraneural inflammation, may be of importance in this context. In this article, four cases are presented in which nerve root related pain gradually resolved without any proven change in the mechanical deformation of the involved nerve root. The data presented here suggest that mechanical compression, per se, may not always be the sole cause of radicular pain and dysfunction. These findings suggest that improvement is needed in our understanding of the pathophysiology of nerve root compression and inflammation. ",0
"Prognostic significance of proteinuria one year after onset of diarrhea-associated hemolytic-uremic syndrome. We examined the prognostic value of changes in the amount of proteinuria, measured as protein/creatinine ratios in early-morning urine samples, in 40 children who had had diarrhea-associated hemolytic-uremic syndrome. One year after diagnosis, 87% of those who seemed to have fully recovered had normal urinary protein/creatinine ratios, compared with none of those with poor outcomes (p less than 0.001). None of those with poor outcomes achieved normal protein/creatinine ratios during follow-up to a maximum of 5 1/2 years, but 93% of those who made a full clinical recovery no longer had proteinuria. Measurement of the protein/creatinine ratio in an early-morning sample of urine is a simple, cost-effective, and noninvasive means of monitoring the progress of patients with diarrhea-associated hemolytic-uremic syndrome, provided that a technique sensitive at low protein concentrations is employed.

"Vaginal epithelial abnormalities in patients with CIN: clinical and pathological features and management. Of 4147 women who had CIN treated by laser at the Regional Gynaecological Oncology Centre, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Gateshead, 103 (2.5%) had co-existing vaginal epithelial abnormalities. CIN 3 was the histological diagnosis most often associated with vaginal lesions. The upper vagina was almost always involved. In 67% the lesion in the cervix appeared to be confluent with that in the vagina. Even when the lesions were confluent, biopsies form the cervical and vaginal components did not always show the same grade of intraepithelial neoplasia and in some biopsies they showed different lesions. Laser treatment appears to be effective for the vaginal lesions and is therefore recommended although, in selected patients, careful follow up alone may suffice. ",0
"Effect of exposure of miners to aluminium powder. 'McIntyre Powder' (finely ground aluminium and aluminium oxide) was used as a prophylactic agent against silicotic lung disease between 1944 and 1979 in mines in northern Ontario. To find out whether the practice produced neurotoxic effects a morbidity prevalence study was conducted between 1988 and 1989. There were no significant differences between exposed and non-exposed miners in reported diagnoses of neurological disorder; however, exposed miners performed less well than did unexposed workers on cognitive state examinations; also, the proportion of men with scores in the impaired range was greater in the exposed than non-exposed group. Likelihood of scores in the impaired range increased with duration of exposure. The findings are consistent with putative neurotoxicity of chronic aluminium exposure. ",0
"Analysis of alterations in the retinoblastoma gene and tumor grade in bone and soft-tissue sarcomas. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between alterations in the retinoblastoma (Rb) gene and tumor grade in bone and soft-tissue sarcomas. A total of 82 patients diagnosed with bone and soft-tissue sarcomas were included in the analysis. We performed PCR and direct DNA sequencing to identify mutations and gene rearrangements in the Rb gene. The tumor grade was determined based on histological analysis. Our results showed that alterations in the Rb gene were present in 53% of the sarcoma cases. The most common type of alteration detected was gene rearrangement (34%), followed by point mutations (22%). Additionally, we found a significant correlation between Rb gene alterations and high tumor grade (p<0.05). These findings suggest that alterations in the Rb gene may play a role in the development and progression of bone and soft-tissue sarcomas. Further studies are warranted to explore the potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications of these findings.",1
"Bilateral sudden deafness and acute acquired toxoplasmosis. Bilateral sudden deafness is a rare and devastating condition that can be caused by various etiologies, including viral infections. We present a case of a previously healthy adult who developed bilateral sudden deafness with concurrent acute acquired toxoplasmosis. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of bilateral sudden deafness associated with acute toxoplasmosis. The patient presented with abrupt onset of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fever, lymphadenopathy, and myalgias. Serologic testing confirmed acute acquired toxoplasmosis, with elevated toxoplasma-specific antibodies in serum. The patient was treated with a combination of antiviral and anti-toxoplasmosis medications, resulting in gradual improvement of hearing loss and resolution of systemic symptoms. This case highlights the importance of considering toxoplasmosis as an underlying etiology in patients presenting with bilateral sudden deafness, especially when accompanied by systemic manifestations.",1
"Mesial temporal sclerosis: pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management. Mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) is a common cause of temporal lobe epilepsy and is characterized by selective neuronal loss and gliosis in the mesial temporal structures, particularly the hippocampus. The exact etiology of MTS remains unknown, but several hypotheses have been proposed, including prenatal insults, febrile seizures, and genetic factors. Diagnosis of MTS is typically made through a combination of clinical history, neuroimaging, and electroencephalography findings. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard imaging modality, revealing hippocampal atrophy and increased T2 signal intensity. Treatment options for MTS include antiepileptic drugs, surgical resection, and neuromodulation techniques. Surgical management, such as anterior temporal lobectomy or selective amygdalohippocampectomy, has shown to yield good seizure control in patients with MTS who are refractory to medications. Overall, a multidisciplinary approach is crucial in the diagnosis and management of MTS to optimize patient outcomes and improve quality of life for those affected by this condition.",1
"Ischaemic heart disease among men in Norway during the period 1966-1985: two counties with different mortality time trends.  We have examined regional differences in mortality from ischaemic heart disease, including sudden, unexpected death (IHD/SUD), among Norwegian men aged 30-69 years, during the period 1966-1985. The aim of this study was to assess the temporal and regional trends in mortality due to ischaemic heart disease (IHD) among men in Norway from 1966 to 1985. Two counties with contrasting mortality patterns were selected for analysis. The results showed a significant increase in IHD-related mortality in both counties over the study period. However, the rate of increase was higher in County A compared to County B. Moreover, County A had a higher prevalence of sudden, unexpected death due to IHD (IHD/SUD) compared to County B. These findings suggest that there may be regional variations in the management and prevention of IHD, which require further investigation for targeted interventions.",1
"Small cell carcinoma of the pancreas and biliary tract. Small cell carcinoma (SCC) is a rare malignancy that commonly arises in the lung, but can also occur in extrapulmonary sites. Here, we report two cases of SCC involving the pancreas and biliary tract. Both patients presented with nonspecific abdominal symptoms and were initially misdiagnosed with primary pancreatic or biliary malignancies. However, histopathological examination revealed features consistent with SCC, including small round cells with scant cytoplasm and high mitotic activity. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed the neuroendocrine nature of the tumors. Due to the aggressive behavior of SCC, both patients received multimodal treatment consisting of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Despite aggressive management, the prognosis for SCC involving the pancreas and biliary tract remains poor, highlighting the need for early recognition and prompt intervention. Further research is warranted to better understand the pathogenesis and optimal treatment strategies for this rare entity.",1
"Central odontogenic fibroma: clinicopathologic features of 19 cases and review of the literature.  The odontogenic fibroma is a benign neoplasm infrequently reported in the literature (20 cases). Central odontogenic fibroma (COF) is a rarely reported benign neoplasm of the jaw. This study aims to present the clinicopathologic features of 19 cases of COF and provide a comprehensive literature review. The study included patients with histologically confirmed COF from a single institution. Clinical data, including age, sex, location, and presenting symptoms, were collected. Histopathological analysis was performed, and immunohistochemical staining for specific markers was conducted. The mean age of the patients was 32.2 years, with a slight female predominance (57.9%). The mandible was the most commonly affected site (63.2%). Pain and swelling were the most frequent presenting symptoms. Histologically, COF showed a richly cellular fibrous stroma with varying amounts of odontogenic epithelium. The immunohistochemical analysis revealed positivity for vimentin and cytokeratin, confirming the odontogenic nature of the tumor. This study expands the literature on COF, emphasizing its clinicopathologic features and aiding in establishing accurate diagnoses and optimal management strategies.",1

"Testicular calcifications and neoplasia in patient treated for subfertility. We present a case study of a patient who underwent treatment for subfertility and was incidentally found to have testicular calcifications on imaging. A subsequent biopsy revealed a neoplastic lesion. The patient was a 35-year-old male who had been receiving hormonal therapy for subfertility for the past four years. He presented with testicular discomfort and was referred for imaging, which showed multiple calcifications in the right testicle. Further evaluation with a biopsy confirmed the presence of a neoplastic lesion, specifically a seminoma. The patient underwent orchidectomy and was subsequently treated with adjuvant radiation therapy. Regular follow-up and monitoring for recurrence have been initiated. This case highlights the importance of investigating incidental findings to rule out malignancy, even in patients undergoing treatment for unrelated conditions, such as subfertility.",1
"Inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms.  In a series of 517 operations for abdominal aortic aneurysm from 1971 to 1988 there were 45 cases (8. Inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms (IAAAs) are a rare but potentially life-threatening condition. This study analyzes a series of 517 operations conducted between 1971 and 1988 for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), identifying 45 cases (8.7%) of IAAAs. The study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of clinical characteristics, operative management, and outcomes of IAAAs within this patient cohort. 

The results show that IAAAs are associated with a higher incidence of rupture compared to non-inflammatory AAA cases (44.4% vs. 23.1%). Patients with IAAAs were significantly younger, with a mean age of 62.7 years. Operative management included resection of the involved segment of aorta and in-situ reconstruction using prosthetic grafts in most cases (85.7%). The postoperative mortality rate for IAAAs was higher than non-inflammatory AAA cases (17.8% vs. 8.1%). 

In conclusion, IAAAs represent a distinct subset of AAAs, associated with a higher risk of rupture and poorer outcomes. Timely diagnosis and appropriate surgical intervention are essential for optimal management of IAAAs. Further research is needed to improve our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and develop more effective treatment strategies for this challenging condition.",1
"Lugol stain for intraoperative determination of the proximal surgical margin of the esophagus. The accuracy of determining the proximal surgical margin during esophageal resection is crucial for achieving successful outcomes. The Lugol stain has been proposed as a method for intraoperative identification of the proximal surgical margin. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of the Lugol stain in 50 patients who underwent esophageal resection.

"Modified technique of Pringle's maneuver in resection of the liver. The Pringle's maneuver, involving temporary occlusion of the hepatic inflow, is commonly used during liver resection to minimize blood loss. However, this technique can lead to ischemic injury to the liver and subsequent complications. Here, we present a modified technique of Pringle's maneuver aimed at reducing these risks. The modified technique involves intermittent clamping and release of the hepatic artery and portal vein, with concurrent preservation of hepatic venous inflow. This approach allows for a controlled and more physiologic liver parenchymal ischemia, decreasing the risk of hepatic injury. In a retrospective analysis of 100 patients who underwent liver resection using this modified technique, we observed a significant reduction in postoperative liver dysfunction and overall complications, suggesting that this approach may offer improved outcomes in liver resection procedures.",1
"Prognostic factors in primary retroperitoneal soft-tissue sarcomas. This retrospective study aimed to identify prognostic factors in primary retroperitoneal soft-tissue sarcomas (PRS). The medical records of 84 patients with PRS who underwent surgical resection between 2005 and 2015 were reviewed. The primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). The median follow-up period was 32 months. The 5-year OS and DFS rates were 40% and 29%, respectively. Univariate analysis revealed that age > 50 years, tumor size > 10 cm, high histological grade, positive surgical margins, and lymph node involvement were significantly associated with worse OS and DFS. Multivariate analysis confirmed age > 50 years and positive surgical margins as independent prognostic factors for OS, while tumor size > 10 cm and high histological grade were independent prognostic factors for DFS. In conclusion, age, tumor size, histological grade, surgical margins, and lymph node involvement can serve as prognostic factors for PRS. These findings will enable better risk stratification and guide treatment decisions for patients with PRS.",1
"Surgery for thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms.  From July 1985 to July 1989, Loma Linda University Medical Center evaluated 46 thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs).

The results of this trial will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of oral antibiotic therapy in the management of postpartum endometritis.",1
"Slowly progressive aphasia: three cases with language, memory, CT and PET data. Slowly progressive aphasia (SPA) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the gradual deterioration of language abilities. This report presents three cases of SPA, examining their language and memory function as well as utilizing computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) data to investigate underlying structural and metabolic changes. The first case exhibited predominantly nonfluent aphasia with marked anomia, while the second case presented with fluent aphasia and impaired comprehension. The third case demonstrated mixed aphasia, featuring elements of both fluent and nonfluent presentations. Cognitive evaluation revealed varying degrees of memory impairment in all cases. CT scans showed bilateral temporal lobe atrophy, predominantly affecting the left hemisphere, while PET scans revealed hypometabolism in the affected regions. These findings suggest that SPA is associated with progressive language impairment, memory decline, and corresponding structural and metabolic changes in the temporal lobes. Further investigation is warranted to explore the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and potential therapeutic interventions for SPA.",1
"Visual evoked potential monitoring of optic nerve function during surgery. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of visual evoked potential (VEP) monitoring for assessing optic nerve function during surgery. VEP is an electrophysiological test that measures the electrical activity of the visual pathway in response to visual stimulation. This monitoring technique has been used in various surgical procedures to minimize the risk of optic nerve injury. In this retrospective analysis, we reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent surgery where VEP monitoring was performed. The findings revealed that VEP monitoring provided valuable information about optic nerve function throughout the surgical procedure. In cases where optic nerve compromise was detected, immediate intervention was undertaken to prevent permanent damage. This study highlights the importance of VEP monitoring as a useful tool in ensuring the safety of optic nerve function during surgical interventions. Further prospective studies are needed to establish the efficacy of this monitoring technique in different surgical settings.",1
"Protein phosphorylation during ischemia.  Many investigations have shown that calcium and adenosine triphosphate are crucial to central nervous system functions. During ischemia, the deprivation of oxygen and nutrients leads to a disruption in cellular homeostasis and energy production, resulting in impaired cellular functions. Protein phosphorylation, the addition of phosphate groups to proteins, plays a critical role in signal transduction pathways and cellular responses to various stimuli. Numerous studies have demonstrated alterations in protein phosphorylation levels and patterns during ischemia, suggesting their involvement in the adaptive and pathological responses of cells to the ischemic insult. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on protein phosphorylation during ischemia, including the regulation of protein kinases and phosphatases, the identification of phosphorylation targets, and the functional implications of altered phosphorylation in different cellular compartments. Understanding the complex network of protein phosphorylation events during ischemia could provide insight into the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets for ischemic diseases such as stroke and myocardial infarction. Further research is warranted to elucidate the specific roles of protein phosphorylation in ischemic pathophysiology and identify potential therapeutic interventions.",1
"Surgical therapy of the eyelids in patients with facial paralysis.  Patients with facial paralysis have a degree of lagophthalmos and paralytic ectropion. Surgical therapy of the eyelids is commonly performed in patients with facial paralysis to alleviate the symptoms of lagophthalmos and paralytic ectropion. This study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of surgical intervention in these patients. A total of 42 patients with facial paralysis underwent eyelid surgery. The majority of patients had lagophthalmos (95.2%) and paralytic ectropion (83.3%) as presenting symptoms. Various surgical techniques, including lateral canthoplasty and tarsorrhaphy, were utilized to address the eyelid abnormalities. In the postoperative period, significant improvement in symptoms was observed, with resolution of lagophthalmos and ectropion in the majority of patients. Complications were generally mild and transient. Surgical therapy of the eyelids proves to be an effective and safe treatment option for patients with facial paralysis and associated eyelid abnormalities.",1
"Clinical outcome of emergency repeat coronary artery bypass surgery. Coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) is a common treatment for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). However, some patients may require repeat CABG due to the recurrence of symptoms or graft failure. This study aimed to determine the clinical outcome of emergency repeat CABG. A retrospective cohort study was conducted, including all patients who underwent emergency repeat CABG at a tertiary hospital over a five-year period. Patient demographics, preoperative risk factors, operative details, and postoperative outcomes were collected and analyzed. The primary outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality, while secondary outcomes included postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, and long-term survival. A total of 87 patients met the inclusion criteria. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 10.3%, with the majority of deaths occurring within the first 30 days postoperatively. Complication rates were high, with respiratory complications being the most common. Longer duration of cardiopulmonary bypass, prolonged hospital stay, and older age were associated with worse outcomes.

"Asymptomatic rhabdomyolysis of unknown etiology. Rhabdomyolysis is a rare condition characterized by muscle breakdown and release of intracellular contents into the bloodstream. It can be caused by various factors, including trauma, infections, drugs, and metabolic disorders. Here, we present a case of asymptomatic rhabdomyolysis of unknown etiology. A 35-year-old male presented with elevated creatine kinase levels and myoglobinuria, but he did not exhibit any symptoms of muscle pain or weakness. Extensive diagnostic workup, including infectious and autoimmune screenings, was inconclusive, ruling out common causes of rhabdomyolysis. The patient was closely monitored for any potential complications, such as acute kidney injury. Asymptomatic rhabdomyolysis can present a diagnostic challenge, requiring a thorough investigation to identify the underlying cause and prevent potential complications. Further research is needed to better understand the pathophysiology and management of this condition.",1
"The cellular biology of bone tumors.  New knowledge in cell and molecular biology has begun to expand the understanding of the biology of osteosarcoma and Ewing's sarcoma. Bone tumors are a heterogeneous group of neoplasms with varying clinical behaviors and treatment outcomes. Among them, osteosarcoma and Ewing's sarcoma are the two most common primary malignant bone tumors in children and adolescents. Recent advances in cell and molecular biology have provided new insights into the pathogenesis and progression of these tumors. Osteosarcoma is characterized by complex genetic alterations involving tumor suppressor genes, oncogenes, and cell cycle regulatory genes. The identification of specific chromosomal translocations and resultant fusion genes has greatly enhanced our understanding of Ewing's sarcoma. Furthermore, the tumor microenvironment, including immune cells and extracellular matrix components, plays a critical role in tumor progression and metastasis. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying bone tumor biology not only provides opportunities for the development of targeted therapies but also contributes to improved prognostication and patient management.",1
"Selective peripheral denervation for torticollis: preliminary results Herein we report the preliminary results in nine patients who have undergone selective peripheral denervation for spasmodic torticollis and have been followed up for at least 13 months. Selective peripheral denervation (SPD) is a surgical intervention for patients with spasmodic torticollis that involves selectively removing the peripheral nerve branches responsible for abnormal muscle contractions. In this study, we present the preliminary results of SPD in nine patients who were followed up for a minimum of 13 months. The aim was to assess the efficacy and safety of SPD in improving symptoms and quality of life. Our findings indicate that SPD led to a significant reduction in torticollis severity and improvement in functional outcomes, with no major complications observed. These results suggest that SPD may be a viable treatment option for patients with spasmodic torticollis, but further research with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods is warranted.",1

"Angina, ischemia, and effort tolerance with vasodilating beta-blockers. Angina is a common symptom in patients with ischemic heart disease and often limits their effort tolerance. Vasodilating beta-blockers have been widely used in the management of angina to alleviate symptoms and improve exercise capacity. However, the optimal dose of vasodilating beta-blockers in this context remains unclear. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the association between different doses of vasodilating beta-blockers and effort tolerance in patients with angina and ischemia. A total of 150 patients with stable angina and myocardial ischemia who were treated with vasodilating beta-blockers were included. Effort tolerance was assessed using exercise testing. The results showed that high-dose vasodilating beta-blocker therapy was associated with significantly improved effort tolerance compared to low-dose therapy. These findings suggest that higher doses of vasodilating beta-blockers may be more effective in improving effort tolerance in patients with angina and ischemia. Further studies are needed to confirm these results and determine the optimal dose of vasodilating beta-blockers in this patient population.",1
"Strokes in African-Americans. Strokes in African-Americans have long been recognized as a significant health concern due to their higher incidence and greater severity compared to other racial and ethnic groups. Various factors contribute to this disparity, including higher prevalence of traditional risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity, as well as socioeconomic and psychosocial factors. Additionally, there may be genetic and biological differences that make African-Americans more susceptible to strokes. Improved understanding of these factors is crucial for developing targeted prevention and treatment strategies. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on the epidemiology, risk factors, and underlying mechanisms of strokes in African-Americans. By addressing these issues, healthcare professionals can work towards reducing the burden of stroke and improving outcomes in this high-risk population.",1
"Does age affect outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation? We examined the relation between age and outcomes in patients treated for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Seattle, Wash. We conducted a retrospective study to determine if age influences the outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in patients treated for cardiac arrest in Seattle, Washington. A total of 500 patients were included in the study, with ages ranging from 18 to 90 years. Outcome measures included return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and survival to hospital discharge. Our results showed that younger patients (<65 years) had significantly higher rates of ROSC compared to older patients (≥65 years) (p<0.05). However, there was no significant difference in survival to hospital discharge between the two age groups. These findings suggest that age may affect the initial success of CPR, but does not have a significant impact on long-term survival outcomes in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients. Further studies are needed to better understand the factors influencing survival in different age groups.",1
"Surgical treatment of aneurysm or dissection involving the ascending aorta and aortic arch, utilizing circulatory arrest and retrograde cerebral perfusion. Surgical treatment of aneurysm or dissection involving the ascending aorta and aortic arch often requires circulatory arrest and retrograde cerebral perfusion. In this study, we evaluated the outcomes and complications associated with this surgical technique. A total of 45 patients who underwent surgery for ascending aorta and aortic arch pathology were included in the study. Circulatory arrest was achieved using deep hypothermia and selective antegrade cerebral perfusion. Retrograde cerebral perfusion was used during the period of circulatory arrest. The overall mortality rate was 8.9%, with three patients experiencing postoperative neurological complications. Other complications included renal failure requiring dialysis and respiratory insufficiency. Despite the high-risk nature of the procedure, surgical treatment with circulatory arrest and retrograde cerebral perfusion appears to be an effective approach with acceptable outcomes in patients with ascending aortic pathology.",1
"Matched group study of surgical resection versus cobalt-60 plaque radiotherapy for primary choroidal or ciliary body melanoma.  We report the results of a nonrandomized, matched-group, survival and visual preservation study of patients with a choroidal or ciliary body melanoma managed by microsurgical resection of the tumor versus cobalt-60 episcleral plaque radiotherapy. In this study, we compared the outcomes of surgical resection and cobalt-60 plaque radiotherapy in patients with primary choroidal or ciliary body melanoma. A nonrandomized matched-group design was used to match patients based on age, tumor size, and location. Survival rates and visual preservation were evaluated as primary endpoints.

Our findings showed that patients who underwent microsurgical resection had comparable survival rates to those treated with cobalt-60 plaque radiotherapy. However, visual preservation was significantly better in the surgical resection group. This suggests that surgical resection may offer an advantage in terms of maintaining visual function in patients with primary choroidal or ciliary body melanoma.

Further studies are needed to confirm these results and evaluate long-term outcomes. Nonetheless, our study highlights the importance of considering both survival rates and visual preservation when choosing the appropriate treatment modality for patients with primary choroidal or ciliary body melanoma.",1
"Primary lymphoma of the central nervous system in two children with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Primary lymphoma of the central nervous system (CNS) is a rare malignancy, particularly in the pediatric population. We present two cases of primary CNS lymphoma in children with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Both patients presented with neurological symptoms, including seizures and focal deficits. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple ring-enhancing lesions in the brain. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis demonstrated elevated levels of lymphocytes and protein. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Treatment consisted of high-dose chemotherapy along with combination antiretroviral therapy for their underlying AIDS. Despite aggressive management, both patients experienced disease progression and ultimately succumbed to complications of CNS lymphoma. This case series highlights the aggressive nature and poor prognosis of primary CNS lymphoma in children with AIDS and underscores the importance of early diagnosis and multidisciplinary management.",1
"Wrist flexion as an adjunct to the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome. Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common condition characterized by compression of the median nerve in the wrist. Current diagnostic methods, such as electrodiagnostic tests, have limitations in sensitivity and specificity. This study aimed to evaluate the use of wrist flexion as an adjunct to the diagnosis of CTS. A total of 100 patients with suspected CTS were included in the study. Wrist flexion was assessed using a goniometer, and electrodiagnostic tests were conducted. The results showed that patients with CTS had significantly reduced wrist flexion compared to those without CTS. Incorporating wrist flexion into the diagnostic process improved the sensitivity and specificity of CTS diagnosis. Wrist flexion can serve as a valuable adjunct to aid in the accurate diagnosis of CTS.",1
"Critical review of gangliosides and thyrotropin-releasing hormone in peripheral neuromuscular diseases. Peripheral neuromuscular diseases are characterized by the dysfunction of the peripheral nerves or muscles, leading to weakness, atrophy, and impaired movement. Gangliosides, a type of glycolipid, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) have been investigated for their potential therapeutic effects in these conditions. This critical review examines the current evidence on the use of gangliosides and TRH in peripheral neuromuscular diseases.

Multiple studies have evaluated the effects of gangliosides and TRH on nerve regeneration, muscle strength, and motor function in various peripheral neuromuscular disease models. Findings suggest that gangliosides play a role in promoting nerve regeneration and restoring muscle strength, while TRH may have neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects. However, the majority of these studies are preclinical, and clinical trials are limited, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions.

Further research is needed to better understand the mechanisms of action and potential clinical benefits of gangliosides and TRH in peripheral neuromuscular diseases. The development of well-designed clinical trials is necessary to provide reliable evidence and guide clinical practice in this field.",1
"Primary defect in alpha-adrenergic responsiveness in patients with varicose veins.  Responsiveness of superficial hand veins to local infusions of noradrenaline was compared in patients with primary varicose veins and in healthy volunteers by use of the dorsal hand vein technique. Patients with primary varicose veins demonstrated a significantly lower alpha-adrenergic responsiveness compared to healthy volunteers. The percentage increase in vein diameter in response to noradrenaline infusion was significantly lower in the varicose vein group compared to the control group. This suggests that there is a primary defect in the alpha-adrenergic receptor pathway in patients with varicose veins, leading to decreased vasoconstriction. These findings may help elucidate the underlying mechanisms responsible for the development and progression of varicose veins and provide new insights into potential therapeutic targets for this common vascular disorder.",1
"Immunohistochemical demonstration of pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor in normal and neoplastic colonic mucosa. Pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (PSTI) is a peptide hormone that has been shown to play a role in the regulation of gastrointestinal mucosal homeostasis. Aberrant expression of PSTI has been reported in various gastrointestinal malignancies, including colorectal cancer. However, the expression pattern of PSTI in normal and neoplastic colonic mucosa remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the immunohistochemical expression of PSTI in 50 normal colonic mucosa samples and 50 colonic adenocarcinoma samples. Our results showed that PSTI expression was significantly decreased in colonic adenocarcinomas compared to normal colonic mucosa. Furthermore, a subset of adenocarcinomas exhibited complete loss of PSTI expression. Interestingly, we observed a positive correlation between PSTI expression and tumor grade, with well-differentiated tumors showing higher PSTI expression compared to poorly differentiated tumors. These findings suggest a potential role of PSTI in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer and highlight its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic marker for this malignancy. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms regulating PSTI expression in colorectal cancer.",1
"Skeletal muscle depressed calcium and phosphofructokinase in chronic heart failure are upregulated by captopril--a double-blind, placebo-controlled study.  The effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, after treatment for 5-6 weeks with 25 mg t. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the effects of captopril on skeletal muscle metabolism in patients with chronic heart failure. After a treatment period of 5-6 weeks with 25 mg of captopril, we measured the levels of calcium and phosphofructokinase in skeletal muscle. The study included 12 patients who were randomly assigned to receive either captopril or placebo. We found that captopril treatment significantly upregulated the levels of calcium (p = 0.02) and phosphofructokinase (p = 0.01) in skeletal muscle compared to placebo. This suggests that captopril has a beneficial effect on skeletal muscle metabolism in patients with chronic heart failure. No adverse effects were observed during the study. Our results highlight the potential of captopril as a treatment option for patients with skeletal muscle dysfunction in chronic heart failure.",1
"Hemodynamic and endocrine effects of mental stress in untreated borderline hypertension. The present study aimed to assess the hemodynamic and endocrine effects of mental stress in untreated borderline hypertension. A total of 50 individuals with borderline hypertension and 50 normotensive controls were enrolled in the study. All participants underwent a mental stress test, including arithmetic tasks and public speaking, while their blood pressure, heart rate, and plasma levels of catecholamines and cortisol were measured before, during, and after the stress test. It was found that individuals with borderline hypertension had a significantly greater increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure during the mental stress test compared to normotensive controls. Moreover, plasma levels of norepinephrine and cortisol were significantly higher in the borderline hypertension group during and after the stress test. These findings suggest that mental stress elicits exaggerated hemodynamic and endocrine responses in individuals with borderline hypertension, which may contribute to the progression of their condition.",1
"Recombination between two 14-bp homologous sequences as the mechanism for gene deletion in factor IX Seattle 1.  Factor IXSeattle 1 is a 10-kb intragenic deletion identified in a family that has hemophilia B.  By sequencing across the site of the deletion, we discovered at the deletion junction a 13-bp sequence (5' . Factor IX Seattle 1 is a rare intragenic deletion associated with hemophilia B. In this study, we investigated the mechanism behind the gene deletion by analyzing the sequence at the deletion junction. Surprisingly, we identified a 13-bp sequence that was identical at both ends of the deletion. This finding suggests that recombination between two 14-bp homologous sequences resulted in the deletion of a 10-kb segment of the factor IX gene. This mechanism of gene deletion has important implications for understanding the molecular basis of genetic disorders and underscores the need for careful examination of the sequence surrounding gene deletions. Further studies are warranted to investigate the prevalence and significance of similar recombination events in other genetic diseases.",1

Among these, 60% presented with at least one pulmonary complaint, while 33% experienced multiple pulmonary symptoms. Common manifestations included cough, chest pain, dyspnea, and hemoptysis. Radiographic findings revealed pleural effusion, consolidation, and nodules. The presence of pleural effusion was significantly associated with the development of severe hepatic amebiasis. Chest imaging, including ultrasound and computed tomography, proved valuable in diagnosing pleuropulmonary involvement. Prompt recognition and appropriate management of these pleuropulmonary manifestations are crucial to ensure optimal patient outcomes. Further research is warranted to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the development of these pulmonary complications in hepatic amebiasis.",1
"The presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) in solitary adult laryngeal papillomas demonstrated by in-situ DNA hybridization with sulphonated probes. In-situ DNA hybridization with sulphonated probes was used to detect the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) in solitary adult laryngeal papillomas. Of the 24 papillomas examined, HPV DNA sequences were detected in 19 cases (79%). The most common types of HPV identified were types 6 and 11, detected in 14 cases and 3 cases, respectively. In addition, HPV types 16 and 18 were detected in one case each. These findings indicate a high prevalence of HPV involvement in solitary adult laryngeal papillomas. The identification of HPV in these cases suggests a potential role of this virus in the pathogenesis of the disease. Further studies are warranted to investigate the clinical implications of HPV detection and to explore potential therapeutic strategies targeting HPV in laryngeal papillomas.",1
"Serological evidence of infection with Helicobacter pylori may predict gastrointestinal intolerance to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) treatment in rheumatoid arthritis. In this study, the authors investigated the association between serological evidence of Helicobacter pylori infection and gastrointestinal intolerance to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) treatment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A total of 120 patients with rheumatoid arthritis were enrolled, and serological testing for H. pylori was performed. Gastrointestinal intolerance to NSAID treatment was assessed using a validated questionnaire. The results showed that 40% of the patients had serological evidence of H. pylori infection, and 60% reported gastrointestinal intolerance to NSAIDs. Importantly, patients with serological evidence of H. pylori infection were significantly more likely to experience gastrointestinal intolerance to NSAID treatment compared to those without H. pylori infection (p<0.05). These findings suggest that serological evidence of H. pylori infection may be a predictive marker for gastrointestinal intolerance to NSAID treatment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Further research is needed to confirm and understand the underlying mechanisms of this association.",1
"Polyamine levels in healthy and tumor tissues of patients with colon adenocarcinoma. Colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The dysregulation of polyamine metabolism has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several cancers, including colon adenocarcinoma.

"HLA class I and class II antigen expression on squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. The expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and class II antigens on squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck plays a crucial role in the antitumor immune response. This study aimed to investigate the expression of these antigens in SCC patients. Immunohistochemical staining was performed on tumor samples obtained from 60 patients with SCC of the head and neck. The expression levels of HLA class I and class II antigens were quantitatively analyzed and compared with clinicopathological features. Our results showed that HLA class I antigens were expressed in 82% of SCC samples, while HLA class II antigens were expressed in 62% of samples. Higher HLA class I expression was significantly associated with better overall survival and disease-free survival rates. Additionally, increased HLA class II expression was correlated with lymph node metastasis and advanced tumor stage. These findings suggest that HLA class I and class II antigen expression may serve as prognostic markers and potential targets for immunotherapeutic interventions in SCC of the head and neck.",1
"Denervation in hemiplegic muscles. Hemiplegia, characterized by paralysis of one side of the body, often leads to muscle denervation and subsequent atrophy. This study aimed to investigate the effects of denervation in hemiplegic muscles in 25 patients with hemiplegia. Muscle denervation was induced by selective neurectomy in 13 patients, while the remaining 12 served as controls. The outcomes were evaluated based on muscle strength, electromyographic activity, and muscle diameter. 

The results showed that denervation in hemiplegic muscles resulted in a significant decrease in muscle strength compared to the control group. Electromyographic activity also decreased in the denervated muscles, indicating reduced neuromuscular function. Furthermore, muscle diameter was significantly reduced in the denervated muscles, demonstrating muscle atrophy. 

Patients who underwent neurectomy experienced complications such as wound infection and delayed healing in 4 cases. Despite these complications, the majority of patients reported improvements in muscle strength and function following neurectomy. 

In conclusion, denervation in hemiplegic muscles leads to muscle weakness, reduced neuromuscular function, and muscle atrophy.

Further studies are necessary to explore the long-term effects and potential benefits of neurectomy in hemiplegic patients.",1
"Systemic hypertension in sleep apnea syndrome. Review article. Systemic hypertension is a common comorbidity in patients with sleep apnea syndrome (SAS). This review aims to summarize the current evidence regarding the relationship between SAS and systemic hypertension. Multiple studies have shown a strong association between SAS and hypertension, with some suggesting a dose-response relationship. The pathophysiology of this association is believed to involve intermittent hypoxia, sympathetic activation, endothelial dysfunction, and increased oxidative stress. Treatment of SAS with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy has been shown to significantly reduce blood pressure levels in hypertensive patients. However, adherence to CPAP therapy remains a challenge. Further research is needed to develop innovative strategies to improve adherence and optimize outcomes in patients with SAS and hypertension.",1
"Nucleolar organizer regions in precancerous and cancerous lesions of the bronchus.  Using a silver staining technique, nucleolar organizer region-associated proteins (Ag-NOR) were studied in paraffin sections of five specimens of normal bronchial epithelium, eight of atypical squamous metaplasia, five of carcinoma in situ, and seven of microinvasive squamous cell carcinoma.  The mean number of Ag-NOR in the nucleus were normal epithelium 1. In this study, the presence of nucleolar organizer regions (NOR) in different stages of bronchial lesions was investigated using a silver staining technique. The study included specimens of normal bronchial epithelium, atypical squamous metaplasia, carcinoma in situ, and microinvasive squamous cell carcinoma. The results showed a progressive increase in the mean number of Ag-NOR in the nucleus from normal epithelium to microinvasive squamous cell carcinoma. This suggests that the accumulation of Ag-NOR may be associated with the development and progression of bronchial lesions, indicating their potential use as a marker for the early detection and monitoring of bronchial cancer. Further research is needed to validate these findings and explore the underlying mechanisms.",1
"Development of language in six hemispherectomized patients. This study aimed to investigate the development of language in six patients who underwent hemispherectomy. The participants were children who had undergone the surgical removal of one cerebral hemisphere to treat severe epilepsy. Language skills were assessed using standardized tests and compared to matched controls. Results showed that all hemispherectomized patients demonstrated significant language development, with most achieving age-appropriate language skills. However, there were individual differences in language outcomes, with some patients showing better performance in expressive language skills compared to receptive language skills, and vice versa. The findings suggest that hemispherectomy does not necessarily result in severe language deficits and that the remaining hemisphere can compensate for the lost language functions. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying language recovery in hemispherectomized patients and to optimize rehabilitation strategies for this population.",1
"Prevalence of common and dysplastic naevi in a Swedish population.  The naevus profile was examined in a Swedish population that was randomly selected from a census file. The prevalence of common and dysplastic naevi in a Swedish population was investigated. A total of 1,500 individuals, randomly selected from a census file, were included in the study. The participants underwent a thorough examination of their naevus profile, including counting and mapping of naevi. The results showed that the prevalence of common naevi was 75%, with an average of 20.3 naevi per person. Dysplastic naevi were found in 12% of the population, with an average of 1.5 dysplastic naevi per person. There was a significant correlation between the presence of dysplastic naevi and a family history of melanoma. Additionally, participants with dysplastic naevi were more likely to have a larger number of common naevi. These findings provide important information regarding the prevalence and characteristics of naevi in the Swedish population, which may contribute to the development of targeted screening and prevention strategies for melanoma.",1
"Effects of anticonvulsant treatment and low levels of folate and thiamine on amine metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of anticonvulsant treatment and low levels of folate and thiamine on amine metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF samples were obtained from patients with epilepsy who were either receiving anticonvulsant treatment or were untreated, and from healthy controls. The levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin metabolites were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. The results showed that patients receiving anticonvulsant treatment had significantly lower levels of dopamine and norepinephrine metabolites compared to untreated patients and controls. However, there were no significant differences in serotonin metabolite levels between the three groups. Furthermore, patients with low levels of folate and thiamine showed significantly lower levels of dopamine and norepinephrine metabolites compared to patients with normal levels of these vitamins. These findings suggest that anticonvulsant treatment and low levels of folate and thiamine may alter amine metabolism in the central nervous system, which could have implications for the management of epilepsy and the potential development of neuropsychiatric symptoms in these patients.",1
"Management of mycotic rupture of the ascending aorta after heart-lung transplantation.  A 19-year-old woman underwent heart-lung transplantation for obstructive bronchiolitis. Mycotic rupture of the ascending aorta is a rare but fatal complication following heart-lung transplantation. This case report presents the management of a 19-year-old woman who developed mycotic rupture of the ascending aorta after undergoing the transplantation procedure for obstructive bronchiolitis. The patient initially presented with fever and sepsis, and imaging studies revealed a pseudoaneurysm in the ascending aorta with associated surrounding abscess formation.

Follow-up imaging showed a successful repair of the aortic rupture, without any evidence of residual abscess or graft infection. The patient's clinical condition improved, and she was discharged in stable condition on a long-term antibiotic regimen. This case underscores the importance of prompt recognition and aggressive surgical management of mycotic rupture of the ascending aorta in post-transplant patients to achieve favorable outcomes.",1
"Degenerative aortic stenosis. Degenerative aortic stenosis (DAS) is a common cardiac valvular disorder characterized by progressive narrowing of the aortic valve orifice due to calcification and fibrosis. This review aims to provide an overview of the pathophysiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, and management of DAS. The primary etiology of DAS is atherosclerosis, which leads to a chronic inflammatory response, oxidative stress, and activation of matrix metalloproteinases, ultimately resulting in valve calcification and dysfunction. Risk factors for DAS include age, male gender, smoking, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and genetic predisposition. Clinical features of DAS can range from asymptomatic to exertional dyspnea, angina, and syncope. The diagnosis is confirmed by echocardiography, and treatment options include medical therapy, aortic valve replacement, or transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Management strategies should be tailored based on patient age, comorbidities, and severity of symptoms. Close monitoring and appropriate intervention are necessary to improve outcomes and quality of life in patients with DAS.",1
"Perianal appearances associated with constipation.  The perianal appearances were studied prospectively of 136 constipated children (mean age 3. The aim of this study was to investigate the perianal appearances associated with constipation in children. A total of 136 constipated children with a mean age of 3 years were included in the study. Perianal appearances were assessed prospectively using standardized criteria. The majority of children (91.9%) exhibited abnormalities in perianal appearances, with the most common findings being perianal erythema (80.9%) and anal fissures (65.4%). Other findings included skin tags (38.2%), perianal excoriation (30.9%), and perianal rash (23.5%). The presence of perianal fissures was significantly associated with severe constipation (p < 0.05). Furthermore, children with perianal erythema were more likely to have a history of hard stools (p < 0.05).

Further studies are warranted to better understand the relationship between perianal appearances and constipation severity.",1
"Delayed positive gastrointestinal bleeding studies with technetium-99m-red blood cells: utility of a second injection. Delayed positive gastrointestinal bleeding studies using technetium-99m-labeled red blood cells (RBCs) have been a valuable diagnostic tool in the evaluation of patients with suspected GI bleeding. However, in certain cases, the initial injection of radiolabeled RBCs may fail to detect the bleeding site due to low sensitivity or inadequate uptake. In this study, we investigated the utility of a second injection of technetium-99m-labeled RBCs in detecting delayed positive bleeding in patients who initially had negative or inconclusive results. Our results showed that a second injection of radiolabeled RBCs significantly improved the detection of delayed positive bleeding, leading to more accurate localization of the bleeding site. Furthermore, the use of additional imaging modalities, such as single-photon emission computed tomography, further enhanced the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic procedure. Ultimately, the incorporation of a second injection of radiolabeled RBCs and advanced imaging techniques can improve the diagnostic accuracy and management decisions in patients with delayed positive gastrointestinal bleeding.",1
"Performing screening flexible sigmoidoscopy using colonoscopes: experience in 500 subjects. Flexible sigmoidoscopy is a commonly used screening tool for colorectal cancer, as it allows for direct visualization of the distal sigmoid colon and rectum. However, the use of colonoscopes for performing sigmoidoscopy has gained attention due to its potential advantages over traditional sigmoidoscopes. In this study, we present our experience with performing screening flexible sigmoidoscopy using colonoscopes in 500 subjects. The procedure was well-tolerated by the patients and yielded high-quality images of the sigmoid colon and rectum.

"Hashimoto's encephalopathy: a steroid-responsive disorder associated with high anti-thyroid antibody titers--report of 5 cases. Hashimoto's encephalopathy is a rare neurological disorder characterized by acute or subacute encephalopathy in patients with high titers of anti-thyroid antibodies. This report presents a case series of five patients diagnosed with Hashimoto's encephalopathy and treated with steroids. The patients' clinical presentations varied, with symptoms such as confusion, seizures, psychosis, and stroke-like episodes. All patients had markedly elevated anti-thyroid antibody titers, supporting the diagnosis of Hashimoto's encephalopathy. Treatment with high-dose intravenous steroids resulted in rapid improvement of symptoms and normalization of cognitive function in all cases. Recurrences of symptoms were observed in two patients who had incomplete maintenance steroid tapering. These cases highlight the importance of recognizing Hashimoto's encephalopathy as a potential cause of encephalopathy and emphasize the need for early diagnosis and prompt treatment with steroids to achieve favorable outcomes. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the pathogenesis and optimal treatment strategies for this rare and underdiagnosed disorder.",1
"The gonadotropin-releasing hormone associated peptide reduces calcium entry in prolactin-secreting cells. The gonadotropin-releasing hormone associated peptide (GnRHAP) has been shown to play a role in regulating calcium entry in various cell types. In this study, we investigated the effect of GnRHAP on calcium entry in prolactin-secreting cells. Our results demonstrate that GnRHAP significantly reduces calcium entry in these cells, suggesting a potential inhibitory role of GnRHAP in prolactin secretion. Furthermore, we found that this effect is mediated by the activation of G protein-coupled receptors and subsequent inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels. These findings provide further insights into the regulatory mechanisms of prolactin secretion and highlight the potential therapeutic implications of targeting GnRHAP signaling in conditions associated with abnormal prolactin levels.",1
"The role of endoscopic injection sclerotherapy in the management of bleeding peristomal varices. Peristomal varices are a well-known complication in patients with portal hypertension and liver cirrhosis. Although rare, bleeding from peristomal varices can be life-threatening and challenging to manage. We present a case of a 54-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis and an ileostomy who presented with recurrent episodes of peristomal variceal bleeding. Despite multiple conservative measures, including endoscopic band ligation, the patient continued to experience hemorrhagic episodes. Given the persistent bleeding, we opted for endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) using a combination of ethanolamine oleate and sodium tetradecyl sulfate. EIS successfully achieved hemostasis, and the patient remained free from bleeding during the six-month follow-up period. This case highlights the potential efficacy of EIS in the management of bleeding peristomal varices. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the long-term outcomes and the role of EIS as a first-line treatment option in this population.",1
"Multiple-pulse stimulation and dantrolene in malignant hyperthermia. Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a potentially life-threatening reaction to certain medications used during anesthesia. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of using multiple-pulse stimulation (MPS) and dantrolene in managing MH episodes. A total of 47 patients diagnosed with MH were included in the study. All patients received treatment with dantrolene, while 24 patients additionally received MPS. The main outcome measures assessed were the time to resolution of signs and symptoms, occurrence of adverse events, and patient outcomes. The results showed that the combination of dantrolene and MPS significantly reduced the time to resolution of MH symptoms compared to dantrolene alone (p<0.05). Additionally, no significant adverse events were reported in the MPS group. The overall patient outcomes were favorable, with no mortalities reported. These findings suggest that the use of MPS in conjunction with dantrolene may be a beneficial approach in the management of MH, resulting in faster resolution of symptoms and improved patient outcomes. Further investigation is warranted to optimize the use of MPS in MH treatment protocols.",1

"Deletion of Alu sequences in the fifth c-sis intron in individuals with meningiomas. Meningiomas are primary tumors of the central nervous system that arise from the meninges. The development of these tumors is thought to be influenced by genetic factors. In a recent study, researchers investigated the presence of Alu sequences in the fifth c-sis intron in individuals with meningiomas. Alu sequences are repetitive elements found within the human genome that have been associated with various diseases. The study found that individuals with meningiomas had a higher frequency of Alu sequence deletions in the fifth c-sis intron compared to healthy controls. These findings suggest that the presence of Alu sequence deletions in this intron may be a potential risk factor for the development of meningiomas. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of Alu sequences in meningioma pathogenesis.",1
"A double-blind study of deflazacort and prednisone in patients with chronic inflammatory disorders. Chronic inflammatory disorders are characterized by persistent inflammation, which can lead to tissue damage and long-term complications. Glucocorticoids, such as prednisone, are commonly used to suppress inflammation and alleviate symptoms. However, these medications are associated with multiple side effects. Deflazacort, a newer synthetic glucocorticoid, has been proposed as an alternative with potentially fewer adverse effects. 

In this double-blind study, patients with chronic inflammatory disorders were randomized to receive either deflazacort or prednisone for a predetermined duration. The primary outcome measure was the improvement in disease activity, as assessed by validated scoring systems. Secondary outcomes included the occurrence of adverse events and changes in laboratory parameters.

Preliminary results showed comparable efficacy between deflazacort and prednisone in controlling disease activity. However, the incidence of adverse events was significantly lower in the deflazacort group, particularly in terms of glucose intolerance and weight gain. These findings suggest that deflazacort may offer a safer alternative to prednisone in the management of chronic inflammatory disorders. Further studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are warranted to confirm these results.",1
"Angiography, angioscopy, and ultrasound imaging before and after percutaneous balloon angioplasty. We evaluated the efficacy of percutaneous balloon angioplasty (PBA) in the treatment of peripheral vascular diseases by assessing the changes in angiography, angioscopy, and ultrasound imaging before and after the procedure. A total of 50 patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) were enrolled in this study. Angiography revealed significant stenosis or occlusion in the affected arteries. Angioscopy provided direct visualization of the affected vessels, confirming the presence of plaque and thrombus. Ultrasound imaging demonstrated reduced blood flow velocity and turbulence in the affected arteries. Following PBA, angiography revealed improved blood flow and patency of the treated vessels. Angioscopy showed removal or dislodgement of plaque and thrombus, with enhanced vascular luminal diameter. Ultrasound imaging demonstrated improved blood flow velocity and reduced turbulence. These findings suggest that PBA is an effective treatment option for peripheral vascular diseases, resulting in improved blood flow and vascular patency, as confirmed by angiography, angioscopy, and ultrasound imaging. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the long-term outcomes and durability of PBA in the management of PAD.",1
"A successful treatment of an intrarenal arteriovenous fistula by percutaneous embolization. Intrarenal arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) are rare but potentially serious vascular anomalies that can cause significant morbidity if left untreated. We present a case of a 42-year-old female with a symptomatic intrarenal AVF, which was successfully treated with percutaneous embolization. The patient presented with gross hematuria and flank pain and was found to have an enlarged and tortuous renal artery on imaging. Angiography confirmed the presence of an intrarenal AVF connecting a branch of the renal artery to a renal vein. Under fluoroscopic guidance, embolization material was selectively delivered to the site of the AVF, leading to complete occlusion and resolution of symptoms. Follow-up imaging at 3 months demonstrated no residual AVF and preserved renal function. Percutaneous embolization is a safe and effective treatment option for intrarenal AVFs, offering a minimally invasive alternative to surgical intervention.",1
"The influence of calcium alginate haemostatic swabs upon operative blood loss in adenotonsillectomy.  Although adenotonsillectomy is regarded as a minor procedure, it has been shown that 18% of patients may experience an operative blood loss of 10-20% of the total blood volume. To evaluate the influence of calcium alginate haemostatic swabs on operative blood loss in adenotonsillectomy, a randomized controlled trial was conducted. Forty patients undergoing adenotonsillectomy were randomly assigned to receive either calcium alginate haemostatic swabs or standard surgical swabs during the procedure. Operative blood loss was measured and compared between the two groups. The results showed that the use of calcium alginate haemostatic swabs significantly reduced operative blood loss compared to standard surgical swabs (mean difference 12.5 ml, p<0.001). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in postoperative complications between the two groups. Therefore, the use of calcium alginate haemostatic swabs can be considered a safe and effective method for reducing operative blood loss in adenotonsillectomy. Further studies are needed to validate these findings.",1
"Reversal of chronic hepatic encephalopathy by colonic exclusion: poor correlation with blood GABA levels. Colonic exclusion has been suggested as a potential treatment for chronic hepatic encephalopathy (CHE). The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between colonic exclusion and blood gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in patients with CHE. Seven patients with CHE who underwent colonic exclusion were included in the study. Blood samples were collected before and after the procedure, and GABA levels were measured using a spectrophotometric assay. Clinical improvement was assessed using the West Haven criteria. Our results showed that colonic exclusion led to a significant improvement in clinical symptoms in all patients. However, there was no significant correlation between blood GABA levels and clinical improvement. These findings suggest that the mechanism by which colonic exclusion reverses CHE may not be solely related to GABA metabolism and that other factors may be involved. Further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.",1
"Dietary fat and risk of breast cancer.  The relationship between dietary fat and subsequent risk of breast cancer was studied in 3988 initially cancer-free Finnish women aged 20-69 y.  During a follow-up period of 20 y, 54 breast-cancer cases were diagnosed.  Risk of breast cancer was significantly inversely related to energy intake and nonsignificantly inversely related to absolute fat intake.  A positive association between energy-adjusted total fat intake and occurrence of breast cancer was also observed. This study examined the association between dietary fat intake and the risk of breast cancer in 3988 Finnish women aged 20-69 years. Over a 20-year follow-up period, 54 cases of breast cancer were identified. The results showed a significant inverse relationship between energy intake and risk of breast cancer, suggesting that higher energy intake may be protective against breast cancer development. However, the association between absolute fat intake and breast cancer risk was not statistically significant. Interestingly, when total fat intake was adjusted for energy intake, a positive association with breast cancer occurrence was observed. These findings highlight the complex relationship between dietary fat and breast cancer risk and indicate the need for further research in this area.",1

"Background review and current concepts of reperfusion injury. Reperfusion injury is a complex pathophysiological process that occurs following the restoration of blood flow to ischemic tissue. It is characterized by the exacerbation of tissue damage and dysfunction, which can occur in multiple organ systems. Although reperfusion is essential for tissue survival, the restoration of blood flow can paradoxically lead to the production of reactive oxygen species, cytokine release, and activation of inflammatory pathways. These events can further damage the ischemic tissue and contribute to the development of organ dysfunction. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of reperfusion injury, including its underlying mechanisms, diagnostic approaches, and potential therapeutic strategies. The identification of novel therapeutic targets may have significant implications in preventing and mitigating the impact of reperfusion injury in clinical settings.",1

Early detection and timely intervention are crucial to prevent access dysfunction and maintain hemodialysis adequacy. The FAM is a non-invasive, easy-to-use device that utilizes radiofrequency-based technology to measure blood flow and detect changes in access fistula function. Several studies have reported the effectiveness of FAM in detecting stenoses, with high sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, the use of FAM has also been associated with improved outcomes, including decreased hospital admissions and increased fistula longevity. In conclusion, the FAM is a valuable tool for monitoring access fistulae and detecting stenoses, leading to more efficient management and improved outcomes in hemodialysis patients.",1
"Reversal of chronic hepatic encephalopathy by colonic exclusion: poor correlation with blood GABA levels. Chronic hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a debilitating condition associated with liver dysfunction. Colonic exclusion, a surgical procedure that diverts the fecal stream from the colon, has shown promise in reversing hepatic encephalopathy. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the role of blood gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels, a neurotransmitter implicated in HE, in the efficacy of colonic exclusion in treating chronic HE. A retrospective analysis of 25 patients who underwent colonic exclusion for chronic HE was performed. Improvement in neurological symptoms was observed in 80% of the patients. Surprisingly, there was no significant correlation between blood GABA levels and clinical improvement following colonic exclusion. These findings suggest that the beneficial effects of colonic exclusion in reversing chronic HE may not be mediated solely by alterations in blood GABA levels. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of colonic exclusion on HE.",1

Further research is needed to establish standardized protocols for serial neurobehavioral assessments in preterm infants, allowing for consistent monitoring and enhanced neurodevelopmental outcomes in this vulnerable population.",1
"Endothelial cell adhesiveness for human T lymphocytes is inhibited by transforming growth factor-beta 1. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses, including the adhesion of T lymphocytes to endothelial cells. To investigate the effect of TGF-beta 1 on endothelial cell adhesiveness for T lymphocytes, an in vitro study was conducted. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured and pretreated with various concentrations of TGF-beta 1. T lymphocytes were then labeled with a fluorescent dye and allowed to adhere to the HUVECs. The results demonstrated that TGF-beta 1 significantly inhibited the adhesion of T lymphocytes to HUVECs in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, Western blot analysis revealed a decrease in the expression of adhesion molecules, such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), on the surface of HUVECs after TGF-beta 1 treatment. These findings suggest that TGF-beta 1 can suppress the adhesiveness of endothelial cells for T lymphocytes, providing potential therapeutic implications for diseases involving aberrant T cell migration and adhesion. Further studies are warranted to fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms of this inhibitory effect.",1
"Discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs in children who have outgrown epilepsy: effects on cognitive function. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are commonly used to manage epilepsy in children. However, the long-term effects of AEDs on cognitive function, especially after seizure remission, remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the cognitive outcomes in children who discontinued AEDs after outgrowing epilepsy. A comprehensive neuropsychological battery was administered to 50 children who had been seizure-free for at least two years and were no longer taking AEDs. Results revealed that discontinuation of AEDs did not significantly impact global cognitive functioning, processing speed, or attention. However, subtle declines were observed in verbal memory and executive functioning. These findings suggest that cautious consideration and monitoring are needed when discontinuing AEDs in children who have outgrown epilepsy to ensure optimal cognitive outcomes.",1
"Tables for estimation of individual risks of fetal neural tube and ventral wall defects, incorporating prior probability, maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels, and ultrasonographic examination results. Prenatal screening for fetal neural tube and ventral wall defects is crucial for early diagnosis and appropriate management. Currently, the estimation of individual risks relies on a combination of factors, including prior probability, maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) levels, and ultrasonographic examination results. In this study, we aimed to develop tables that incorporate these factors to improve the accuracy of risk assessment. 

A retrospective analysis was conducted on a cohort of pregnant women who underwent prenatal screening for these defects. The tables were constructed using statistical modeling techniques, taking into account the individual probabilities of each factor. Validation of the tables was performed using a separate cohort of pregnant women. 

The results showed that the developed tables provided a reliable estimation of individual risks, with high sensitivity and specificity. By incorporating MSAFP levels and ultrasonographic examination results, the tables allowed for more precise risk stratification and improved clinical decision-making. Overall, these tables have the potential to enhance prenatal screening programs and improve outcomes for infants at risk of neural tube and ventral wall defects.",1
"Spinal coning after lumbar puncture in prostate cancer with asymptomatic vertebral metastasis: a case report.  A 60-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for complete urinary retention. During evaluation for the cause of his urinary retention, the patient underwent a lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Shortly after the procedure, he developed severe back pain and bilateral lower extremity weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine revealed multiple osteoblastic metastases involving the lumbar vertebrae. However, no evidence of cord compression or epidural metastasis was observed. Subsequent MRI demonstrated significant spinal cord edema and distortion, consistent with spinal coning. The patient was promptly treated with corticosteroids and underwent radiotherapy for palliation. This case highlights the importance of cautious evaluation and management in patients with known or suspected spinal metastases, as lumbar puncture can potentially precipitate spinal coning and neurological compromise even in the absence of obvious epidural compression.",1

"Is sick sinus syndrome an adenosine-mediated disease? Effects of intravenous aminophylline on sick sinus node function after pharmacologic autonomic blockade. Sick sinus syndrome (SSS) is a disorder characterized by the malfunctioning of the sinus node, resulting in abnormal heart rhythm. The etiology of SSS is not fully understood, and recent evidence suggests a potential involvement of adenosine, a purinergic signaling molecule, in its pathogenesis. This study aimed to investigate the effects of intravenous aminophylline, a non-selective adenosine receptor antagonist, on sick sinus node function after pharmacologic autonomic blockade.

Twenty patients diagnosed with SSS were enrolled in the study. Autonomic blockade was achieved by intravenous administration of atropine and propranolol. Electrophysiological studies were conducted to measure sinus node recovery time (SNRT) before and after administration of aminophylline.

Results showed a significant prolongation of SNRT after autonomic blockade, indicating impaired sinus node function. Following administration of aminophylline, there was a significant reduction in SNRT, suggesting an improvement in sick sinus node function.

These findings provide evidence for the involvement of adenosine in the pathogenesis of SSS and suggest that aminophylline may have potential therapeutic benefits in the management of this condition. Further research is warranted to fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms and to explore the clinical implications of adenosine-mediated therapy in SSS.",1

"Study of preneoplastic changes of liver cells by immunohistochemical and molecular hybridization techniques. The aim of this study was to investigate preneoplastic changes in liver cells using immunohistochemical and molecular hybridization techniques. Liver tissues from 50 patients with suspected preneoplastic lesions were analyzed. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to assess the expression levels of specific markers associated with neoplastic transformation. Additionally, molecular hybridization techniques such as fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) were used to detect specific genetic alterations. Results showed significant upregulation of markers related to cell proliferation and DNA damage in the preneoplastic lesions compared to normal liver tissue. FISH analysis revealed genetic abnormalities, including chromosomal rearrangements and gene amplifications, in a subset of the preneoplastic lesions. These findings provide insights into the early molecular changes occurring in liver cells prior to neoplastic transformation and may contribute to the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for liver cancer.",1
"Effects of tracheal irritation and hypercapnia on tracheal smooth muscle in humans. Tracheal irritation and hypercapnia have been recognized as potential factors contributing to airway hyperresponsiveness in various respiratory conditions. However, the specific effects of these stimuli on tracheal smooth muscle (TSM) in humans remain poorly understood. In this study, isolated human tracheal segments were subjected to increasing concentrations of irritant gases and elevated levels of carbon dioxide, mimicking tracheal irritation and hypercapnia, respectively. The contractile responses of TSM were measured to assess the impact of these stimuli. Results showed that tracheal irritation significantly increased TSM contractility, with a dose-dependent relationship observed. Similarly, hypercapnia induced a significant augmentation of TSM contractile responses. Furthermore, pre-treatment with specific inhibitors of bronchoconstriction pathways attenuated the enhanced contractile responses, suggesting the involvement of these signaling pathways in TSM hyperresponsiveness. These findings provide new insights into the pathophysiology of airway hyperresponsiveness and suggest potential therapeutic targets for respiratory diseases associated with tracheal irritation and hypercapnia. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and explore novel treatment approaches.",1
"Orthostatic hypotension in human immunodeficiency virus infection may be the result of generalized autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Orthostatic hypotension, defined as a decrease in blood pressure upon standing, is commonly observed in individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The underlying mechanisms contributing to this condition remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the possible association between orthostatic hypotension in HIV-infected individuals and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Ten HIV-positive patients with orthostatic hypotension and ten HIV-positive control patients without orthostatic hypotension were included in the study. Autonomic function tests, including heart rate variability and deep breathing tests, were performed on all participants. The results revealed that HIV-infected individuals with orthostatic hypotension exhibited significantly impaired autonomic function compared to control patients without orthostatic hypotension. These findings suggest that generalized autonomic nervous system dysfunction may contribute to the development of orthostatic hypotension in HIV-infected individuals, highlighting the need for further research to better understand and manage this condition.",1

CT should be considered as an essential imaging modality in the management of pediatric patients with Crohn's disease.",1
"The surprising kidney-fluid mechanism for pressure control--its infinite gain! In this short paper, I have tried to explain the elation that we felt when we first realized that the kidney-fluid mechanism for controlling the arterial pressure has an infinite feedback gain property. The kidney-fluid mechanism for pressure control has long been the subject of study and fascination in the field of physiology. In this paper, we present our findings on the surprising property of this mechanism - its infinite feedback gain. Through mathematical modeling and experimental validation, we demonstrate that the kidney-fluid mechanism is able to regulate arterial pressure with remarkable precision and efficiency. This infinite gain property allows for rapid and sensitive adjustments to changes in blood volume or pressure, ensuring the maintenance of homeostasis. Our findings shed new light on the intricate mechanisms involved in blood pressure regulation and have implications for understanding and treating conditions such as hypertension.",1
"Preoperative piroxicam for postoperative analgesia in dental surgery.  Fifty patients were allocated randomly to receive placebo or piroxicam 40 mg, 2. In a randomized controlled trial, fifty patients undergoing dental surgery were assigned to receive either placebo or preoperative piroxicam 40 mg, 2. Postoperative analgesia was assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS) to measure pain intensity at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours after surgery. 

The results showed that patients in the piroxicam group had significantly lower VAS scores compared to those in the placebo group at all time points (p<0.05). Furthermore, the piroxicam group required fewer rescue analgesics compared to the placebo group (p<0.05). 

This study suggests that preoperative administration of piroxicam 40 mg can effectively reduce postoperative pain in dental surgery and may be considered as a viable option for improved pain management in this setting.",1

This study emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis and appropriate management strategies for LRTIs to reduce morbidity and mortality.",1
"Experimental retinal branch vein occlusion in miniature pigs induces local tissue hypoxia and vasoproliferative microangiopathy. Retinal branch vein occlusion (BRVO) is a common cause of vision loss, and its pathophysiology remains poorly understood. This study aimed to develop a miniature pig model of BRVO to investigate the mechanisms underlying retinal hypoxia and vasoproliferative microangiopathy. BRVO was induced in the eyes of eight miniature pigs using laser photocoagulation. The occluded veins exhibited persistent venous dilatation and tortuosity, leading to increased intraocular pressure and subsequent retinal hypoxia. Histological analysis revealed the presence of neovascularization, both within and beyond the occluded vein. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors, suggesting a key role in the development of vasoproliferative microangiopathy. This novel miniature pig model of BRVO provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of retinal hypoxia and neovascularization, and may facilitate the development of new treatment strategies for BRVO-related vision loss.",1
"A seromuscular stripping method to create a nipple valve without metal stapling for continent urinary reservoir. Creating a nipple valve without the use of metal stapling in continent urinary reservoir surgery is described. A new technique using a seromuscular stripping method is presented as an alternative to the traditional metal stapling method for creating a functional nipple valve. The procedure was performed on 15 patients, all of whom had undergone a continent urinary diversion for various indications. The seromuscular stripping technique involved carefully stripping the seromuscular layer of the bowel segment to create a ridge, which was then sutured to form the nipple valve. Post-operative outcomes were evaluated, including continence rates and complications. The results showed that the seromuscular stripping method successfully created a functional nipple valve in all patients, with a continence rate of 93% at one year post-operatively. Complications were minimal, with only one patient experiencing valve stenosis requiring revision. This technique provides a safe and effective alternative to metal stapling for creating a continent urinary reservoir nipple valve.",1
"Standards for evaluating results of interventional therapy for peripheral vascular disease. Evaluation of interventional therapy for peripheral vascular disease (PVD) requires standardized criteria for accurate assessment. This study aimed to establish such standards by examining key outcome measures and their significance. A total of 200 patients with PVD who underwent interventional therapy were included. Angiographic analysis revealed improvement in vessel patency in 150 patients (75%), while the remaining 50 (25%) showed no improvement. Functional outcomes were assessed by measuring ankle-brachial index (ABI) and peak systolic velocity (PSV). In the improved group, ABI increased by a mean of 0.9 and PSV increased by 50 cm/s, while in the non-improved group, ABI increased by 0.3 and PSV increased by 10 cm/s. The improved group also exhibited a significant reduction in symptoms and improved quality of life compared to the non-improved group. A composite score incorporating angiographic, ABI, and PSV findings differentiated between successful and unsuccessful interventions. These standardized criteria provide a valuable framework for evaluating the efficacy of interventional therapy in PVD, aiding in treatment decisions and improving patient outcomes.",1
"Hemodynamic effects of H2-receptor antagonists. H2-receptor antagonists are commonly used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and peptic ulcers by reducing gastric acid secretion. However, recent studies have suggested that these medications may have additional effects on the cardiovascular system. This study aimed to investigate the hemodynamic effects of H2-receptor antagonists in healthy individuals. Twenty volunteers were administered either a single dose of an H2-receptor antagonist or a placebo, and their cardiovascular parameters were monitored. Results showed that H2-receptor antagonists significantly reduced heart rate and systemic vascular resistance compared to placebo. These findings suggest that H2-receptor antagonists may have a direct impact on cardiovascular function, potentially influencing blood pressure regulation and cardiovascular outcomes.

"Acute water intoxication as a complication of urine drug testing in the workplace Urine drug testing is now mandatory in many industries. Acute water intoxication is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of urine drug testing in the workplace. We present here three cases of acute water intoxication that occurred as a result of excessive fluid consumption during the preparation for urine drug testing. All three patients experienced severe hyponatremia, with serum sodium levels ranging from 115 to 125 mmol/L. Clinical manifestations included nausea, vomiting, headache, confusion, and seizures. Prompt recognition and treatment with fluid restriction and hypertonic saline were essential in reversing the hyponatremia and preventing further neurological complications. Employers and healthcare providers should be aware of the potential risks associated with excessive fluid consumption during urine drug testing and take appropriate measures to prevent acute water intoxication.",1
"Assessing the severity of dementia.  Patient and caregiver. The severity of dementia can have significant implications for patient care and management. This study aimed to assess the agreement between patient self-report and caregiver report in determining the severity of dementia. A total of 100 patient-caregiver dyads were recruited from a memory clinic. Patients were diagnosed with different stages of dementia based on standardized cognitive tests, while caregivers completed validated questionnaires assessing the severity of patient symptoms and functional impairment. The results showed a moderate level of agreement between patient and caregiver ratings of dementia severity (κ = 0.52, p < 0.001). However, when examining specific domains such as memory, language, and executive function, the agreement was notably lower. Caregivers tended to rate symptoms as more severe than patients themselves, particularly in the early stages of dementia. These findings indicate the importance of considering both patient and caregiver perspectives when assessing dementia severity and highlight the potential for discrepancies between self-report and caregiver report. Further research is needed to explore the factors influencing these discrepancies and their implications for patient management.",1
"Evaluation of the fine needle aspiration biopsy in the preoperative selection of cold thyroid nodules. Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is widely used in the evaluation of thyroid nodules. However, its reliability in preoperative selection of cold thyroid nodules remains uncertain. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of FNAB in identifying malignant thyroid nodules and determine its role in preoperative decision-making.

A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients with cold thyroid nodules who underwent FNAB and subsequent surgical resection. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and diagnostic accuracy of FNAB were calculated. Additionally, the impact of FNAB results on surgical decision-making and patient outcomes was assessed.

Among the included patients, FNAB demonstrated a sensitivity of 78%, specificity of 92%, PPV of 83%, NPV of 90%, and diagnostic accuracy of 88% in identifying malignant thyroid nodules. The FNAB results influenced the surgical decision-making process in 65% of cases, with 90% concordance between FNAB results and final histopathology.

"Suppressive effects of visceral tumor on the generation of antitumor T cells for adoptive immunotherapy. The immune system plays a critical role in the recognition and elimination of tumor cells. However, tumors have evolved various mechanisms to evade immune surveillance, including the induction of immunosuppressive effects. In this study, we investigated the impact of visceral tumors on the generation of antitumor T cells for adoptive immunotherapy. We utilized a murine model of visceral tumor growth and found that the presence of such tumors suppressed the generation of tumor-specific T cells in the spleen and lymph nodes. Furthermore, we observed a significant decrease in the production of interferon-gamma, a key cytokine involved in antitumor immune responses, by T cells isolated from tumor-bearing mice. We also demonstrated that the suppressive effects of the tumor were mediated, at least in part, by the upregulation of inhibitory molecules on antigen-presenting cells. These findings highlight the need to consider the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment when designing strategies for adoptive immunotherapy in cancer patients.",1
"Regional differences in the intranodal distribution of tumor cells. Understanding the intranodal distribution of tumor cells within regional lymph nodes is crucial for predicting the spread and progression of cancer. This study aimed to investigate the regional differences in intranodal distribution of tumor cells in lymph node metastases. Lymph nodes from 50 patients diagnosed with various types of cancer were analyzed using immunohistochemistry and digital imaging. The distribution of tumor cells within the lymph nodes was quantitatively measured and compared between different regions. Significant differences in tumor cell distribution were observed, with a higher concentration of tumor cells in the central regions of the lymph nodes compared to the peripheral regions. These regional differences were consistent across different types of cancer and correlated with the size and type of lymph node metastasis. Furthermore, the intranodal distribution of tumor cells was associated with the presence of lymphatic vessel invasion and nodal extracapsular extension. These findings highlight the importance of considering regional differences in intranodal tumor cell distribution for accurate staging and prognosis in cancer patients.",1
"Thyroidectomy under local anesthesia. Thyroidectomy is a common surgical procedure typically performed under general anesthesia. However, some patients may not be suitable candidates for general anesthesia due to medical reasons or personal preference. This case report presents a 45-year-old female patient who underwent a total thyroidectomy under local anesthesia.

"Aggressive therapeutic amniocentesis for treatment of twin-twin transfusion syndrome.  Acute severe twin-twin transfusion syndrome occurs in about 1% of monochorionic twin gestations. Aggressive therapeutic amniocentesis has been proposed as a potential treatment for acute severe twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) in monochorionic twin gestations. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this intervention. A retrospective analysis was performed on 50 cases of acute severe TTTS that underwent aggressive therapeutic amniocentesis. The procedure involved serial amniocentesis to drain excess amniotic fluid from the recipient twin's sac. Outcomes including perinatal survival, neurodevelopmental outcomes, and complications were assessed. The overall perinatal survival rate was 78%, with 16% of cases resulting in the survival of both twins. Neurodevelopmental outcomes were favorable in the surviving infants. Complications such as membranous decompression syndrome and preterm delivery were observed, but overall, the procedure was deemed safe. Aggressive therapeutic amniocentesis appears to be a viable option for the treatment of acute severe TTTS, providing improved perinatal survival rates and favorable neurodevelopmental outcomes, albeit with associated risks and complications. Further prospective studies are warranted to validate these findings.",1
"Dissection of the cardinal ligament in radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer with emphasis on the lateral ligament. Radical hysterectomy is a standard surgical treatment for cervical cancer. However, there is still debate regarding the optimal dissection technique, particularly with respect to the cardinal ligament and lateral ligament. This study aims to investigate the dissection of the cardinal ligament, with a specific focus on the lateral ligament.

A retrospective analysis was conducted on 200 patients who underwent radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer. The dissection of the cardinal ligament was described in detail, and the presence of lateral ligament involvement was assessed. The outcomes of interest included intraoperative complications, lymph node metastasis, and disease-free survival.

The results showed that the majority of patients (80%) had lateral ligament involvement, which was associated with a higher risk of lymph node metastasis (p < 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in intraoperative complications between patients with or without lateral ligament involvement. Moreover, disease-free survival was not significantly affected by lateral ligament involvement (p = 0.345).

In conclusion, the dissection of the cardinal ligament in radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer should include adequate attention to the lateral ligament. Although lateral ligament involvement is common, it does not appear to have a significant impact on disease-free survival. Further studies are warranted to confirm these findings and optimize the dissection technique.",1
"Hemodynamic effects of partial correction of chronic anemia by recombinant human erythropoietin in patients on dialysis.  Eighteen patients on chronic hemodialysis with renal anemia were treated with recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO). The hemodynamic effects of partial correction of chronic anemia by recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) were evaluated in 18 patients on chronic hemodialysis. The patients were treated with r-HuEPO to achieve a target hemoglobin level of 11-12 g/dL. Hemodynamic parameters, including systolic and diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, and cardiac output, were measured at baseline and after 12 weeks of r-HuEPO therapy. The results showed a significant increase in hemoglobin levels from 8.5 g/dL at baseline to 11.9 g/dL after treatment. There was also a significant decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, and an increase in cardiac output. These findings suggest that partial correction of chronic anemia with r-HuEPO in patients on dialysis has favorable hemodynamic effects, potentially improving cardiovascular outcomes in this population.",1
"Peritoneal closure or non-closure at cesarean.  The value of peritoneal closure at the time of cesarean birth was evaluated prospectively. The study aimed to determine the impact of peritoneal closure on postoperative outcomes in cesarean births. A total of 200 consecutive patients undergoing cesarean section were included in the study and allocated into two groups: peritoneal closure (n=100) and non-closure (n=100). The primary outcome measures were the incidence of postoperative complications, such as wound infection, wound dehiscence, and intra-abdominal collection. The secondary outcome measures included the length of hospital stay and the need for postoperative interventions. The results showed no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative complications between the two groups (p>0.05). Additionally, there was no difference in the length of hospital stay or the need for postoperative interventions. Therefore, the study suggests that peritoneal closure may not provide additional benefits in cesarean births.",1
"Use of a central 10 degrees field and size V stimulus to evaluate and monitor small central islands of vision in end stage glaucoma. End stage glaucoma often leads to the development of small central islands of vision, which can greatly impact the visual function and quality of life of affected individuals. In this study, we investigated the use of a central 10 degrees field and size V stimulus to assess and monitor these small central islands of vision in patients with end stage glaucoma. A total of 40 patients with end stage glaucoma were included in the study. Visual field testing using the central 10 degrees field and size V stimulus demonstrated improved detection of small central islands of vision compared to standard visual field testing methods.

"Synergism of herpes simplex virus and tobacco-specific N'-nitrosamines in cell transformation. The synergistic effects of herpes simplex virus (HSV) and tobacco-specific N'-nitrosamines (TSNAs) on cell transformation were investigated in this study. Human fibroblast cells were infected with HSV and exposed to various concentrations of TSNAs. Cell transformation was assessed using colony formation assays and measurement of cell proliferation rates. It was observed that the combination of HSV infection and TSNAs exposure significantly increased cell transformation compared to HSV infection or TSNAs exposure alone. Furthermore, the synergistic effects were dose-dependent, with higher concentrations of TSNAs leading to greater cell transformation. These findings suggest that there is a synergism between HSV and TSNAs in promoting cell transformation, potentially increasing the risk of developing tobacco-related cancers in individuals infected with HSV. Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and develop preventive strategies.",1
"Home blood pressure readings in borderline hypertensive patients. Home blood pressure (BP) monitoring has gained popularity as a reliable method for assessing BP control in hypertensive patients. However, its utility in borderline hypertensive patients remains uncertain. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of home BP monitoring in this population. A total of 100 borderline hypertensive patients were enrolled and instructed on the proper use of a home BP monitoring device. They were advised to measure their BP at both morning and evening for one week. The results were compared to simultaneous clinic BP measurements. The mean age of the participants was 45 years, with 52% being female. The mean clinic BP was 135/85 mmHg, while the mean home BP was 128/82 mmHg. There was a strong correlation between clinic and home BP measurements (r=0.82, p<0.001). The overall agreement between the two methods was good, with a mean difference of 7/3 mmHg. In conclusion, home BP monitoring is feasible and accurate in borderline hypertensive patients, providing a valuable tool for assessing BP control outside of the clinic setting.",1
"Elevated serum bromide concentrations following repeated halothane anaesthesia in a child.  A 20-month-old child received 25 brief halothane general anaesthetics over a five-week period to allow cranial irradiation treatments for a posterior fossa ependymoma. Following each anaesthetic, the child developed marked respiratory depression, which was reversed with naloxone.  Despite adequate hydration and normal renal function, the child developed symptoms consistent with bromide intoxication, including excessive salivation, facial erythema, and lethargy.  Serum bromide concentrations measured after 25 anaesthetics were elevated to a mean of 9.8 mg/dL.  This concentration is more than 20 times the normal therapeutic range and similar to concentrations reported to produce symptoms of intoxication in literature.  This case emphasizes the importance of considering halothane as a source of bromide ions and highlights the potential for elevated serum bromide concentrations following repeated halothane anaesthesia.  Medical professionals should be aware of potential complications associated with repeated exposure to halothane and consider alternative anaesthetic agents when feasible.",1
"Regional differences in the intranodal distribution of tumor cells. The intranodal distribution of tumor cells in regional lymph nodes has been studied in 50 patients with metastatic melanoma. The distribution patterns were evaluated using immunohistochemistry to identify tumor cells within the lymph nodes. Regional differences were observed in the distribution of tumor cells within the lymph nodes, with some nodes showing a higher concentration of tumor cells in the cortex, while others had a higher concentration in the medulla. Furthermore, nodal areas near the primary tumor site exhibited a higher number of tumor cells compared to remote nodal areas. These findings suggest that the intranodal distribution of tumor cells is not uniform and may be influenced by regional factors such as lymphatic drainage patterns and proximity to the primary tumor site. Understanding these regional differences may have implications for the evaluation of lymph node involvement and the design of targeted therapies for metastatic melanoma. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving these regional differences in tumor cell distribution within lymph nodes.",1

"Indications for use of ketoconazole in management of metastatic prostate cancer. Metastatic prostate cancer (MPC) remains a major challenge in clinical oncology due to its high mortality rate and limited treatment options. Ketoconazole, an antifungal agent, has shown promise in the management of MPC. Its action as an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 enzymes leads to a reduction in circulating androgens, which are known to promote the progression of prostate cancer. In addition, ketoconazole has been found to inhibit adrenal androgen synthesis and may further suppress androgen production in MPC patients. Clinical trials have demonstrated that ketoconazole, either as monotherapy or in combination with other agents, can lead to a significant reduction in prostate-specific antigen levels and tumor burden. Adverse effects such as liver toxicity and drug interactions should be carefully monitored. With further investigation, ketoconazole may prove to be a valuable therapeutic option in the management of MPC.",1

"Role of oxygen free radicals in ischemic and reperfused myocardium. Ischemic heart disease remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Reperfusion therapy, such as thrombolytic therapy or percutaneous coronary intervention, has significantly improved outcomes in patients with acute myocardial infarction. However, paradoxically, reperfusion itself may induce additional injury to the myocardium, known as reperfusion injury. This phenomenon is characterized by a cascade of events involving the production of oxygen free radicals.

Oxygen free radicals are highly reactive molecules that can cause cellular damage by initiating lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, DNA damage, and activation of inflammatory pathways. In the setting of ischemia and subsequent reperfusion, an excess of oxygen free radicals is generated due to the increased availability of molecular oxygen.

Several mechanisms contribute to the generation of oxygen free radicals during reperfusion, including mitochondrial dysfunction, activation of xanthine oxidase, and activation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase. These reactive species not only directly damage cellular components but also contribute to the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells, such as neutrophils and macrophages.

Growing evidence suggests that oxygen free radicals play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of reperfusion injury. Numerous experimental studies have demonstrated that interventions aimed at reducing oxygen free radicals, such as antioxidant therapy and inhibition of NADPH oxidase, can attenuate reperfusion injury and improve myocardial salvage.

In conclusion, reperfusion injury represents an important clinical challenge in the management of patients with acute myocardial infarction. Oxygen free radicals contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of reperfusion injury, and targeting these reactive species holds promise for mitigating myocardial damage and improving patient outcomes. Further research is warranted to delineate the precise mechanisms underlying reperfusion injury and to identify novel therapeutic targets for this debilitating condition.",1

"Neuroendocrine carcinoid tumours of the breast: a variant of carcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation. Neuroendocrine carcinoid tumors of the breast are a rare variant of breast carcinoma characterized by neuroendocrine differentiation. These tumors account for less than 1% of all breast carcinomas and have distinct clinicopathological features. This abstract aims to summarize the current knowledge on neuroendocrine carcinoid tumors of the breast. 

Histologically, these tumors display neuroendocrine features, such as nested and trabecular growth patterns, characteristic chromogranin A and synaptophysin immunohistochemistry, and neurosecretory granules. They are typically estrogen and progesterone receptor positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative. 

Clinical presentation is variable, with most patients presenting with a palpable mass. Imaging modalities, such as mammography and ultrasound, may show suspicious findings, but a definitive diagnosis relies on histopathological examination. The prognosis of neuroendocrine carcinoid tumors of the breast is favorable, with a low risk of lymph node metastasis and a good response to hormonal therapy. 

Further research is needed to better understand the molecular characteristics and optimal management of these rare breast tumors.",1
"The risk of large bowel cancer after partial gastrectomy for benign ulcer disease.  The relative risk (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] for colorectal cancer after partial gastrectomy for ulcer disease was examined in a population-based cohort comprising 6459 patients operated during 1950 to 1958.  Follow-up through 1983 revealed 131 cases of colorectal cancer versus 150. The risk of developing colorectal cancer after partial gastrectomy for benign ulcer disease was investigated in a population-based cohort study. The study included 6459 patients who underwent partial gastrectomy between 1950 and 1958. The patients were followed up until 1983, during which 131 cases of colorectal cancer were identified. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was calculated to determine the relative risk of developing colorectal cancer after partial gastrectomy. The SIR for colorectal cancer in this cohort was found to be 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.73-1.02), indicating that there was no significant increase in the risk of developing colorectal cancer after partial gastrectomy for benign ulcer disease. These findings suggest that partial gastrectomy for benign ulcer disease does not substantially increase the risk of developing colorectal cancer.",1
"Cardiac arrest during hip arthroplasty with a cemented long-stem component. Cardiac arrest is a rare but life-threatening complication that can occur during hip arthroplasty with a cemented long-stem component. This case report describes a 62-year-old male patient who experienced sudden cardiac arrest during surgery. Despite immediate initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation, the patient remained hemodynamically unstable.

Several potential factors contributed to the cardiac arrest, including preexisting coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, and the surgical procedure itself. However, the most likely cause was a cement embolism, as evidenced by the sudden onset of hypotension and oxygen desaturation, along with the absence of other identifiable causes.

Cardiac arrest during hip arthroplasty is a rare but devastating complication that requires prompt recognition and intervention. Surgeons should be aware of the possibility of cement embolism and use preventive measures, such as meticulous cementing technique and proper positioning of the components, to minimize the risk. Furthermore, a high level of preparedness and coordinated efforts between the surgical and anesthesia teams are crucial for managing such emergencies effectively and improving patient outcomes.",1

"Amiloride blocks the onset of ACTH-induced hypertension in the sheep. Hypertension induced by ACTH administration has been widely studied in animal models. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has been implicated as a key player in the development of ACTH-induced hypertension. The aldosterone antagonist, amiloride, has been found to have inhibitory effects on the RAAS. In this study, we investigate the potential of amiloride to block the onset of ACTH-induced hypertension in sheep. Ten sheep were divided into two groups, with one group receiving ACTH alone and the other receiving ACTH in combination with amiloride. Blood pressure was measured before and after treatment, and plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels were assessed. Our results demonstrate that amiloride effectively blocked the development of hypertension induced by ACTH administration in sheep. These findings suggest a potential therapeutic role for amiloride in the management of ACTH-induced hypertension in humans, warranting further investigation.",1

The polyps were predominantly located in the proximal jejunum. Histopathological analysis revealed a variety of polyp types, including adenomas and hamartomas. Importantly, push-type jejunal endoscopy identified seven patients with advanced adenomas, facilitating early intervention and reducing the risk of malignant transformation. Our findings demonstrate the value of push-type jejunal endoscopy as an effective modality for the detection and management of jejunal polyps in patients with FAC/Gardner's syndrome.",1
"Uniparental paternal disomy in Angelman's syndrome. Angelman's syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by severe intellectual disability, developmental delay, speech impairment, and a unique behavioral phenotype. The majority of cases are caused by a deletion or mutation in the maternally inherited chromosome 15q11-q13 region. However, approximately 5-7% of cases result from uniparental paternal disomy (UPD), in which both copies of chromosome 15 are inherited from the father. This abnormality disrupts the imprinting process that normally occurs in this region and leads to the loss of expression of the UBE3A gene, which is critical for normal brain development. UPD can be detected through genetic testing, specifically through methylation analysis or chromosomal microarray analysis. Understanding the underlying genetic mechanisms of Angelman's syndrome, including UPD, is important for accurate diagnosis and management of affected individuals.",1
"Primary orchiectomy versus estrogen therapy in advanced prostatic cancer--a randomized study: results after 7 to 10 years of followup. In this randomized study, the efficacy of primary orchiectomy versus estrogen therapy in the treatment of advanced prostatic cancer was evaluated over a 7 to 10-year follow-up period. A total of 156 male patients with advanced prostatic cancer were enrolled and randomized into two groups: one group underwent primary orchiectomy, while the other group received estrogen therapy. 

The results of this study showed that both treatment modalities demonstrated comparable efficacy in terms of overall survival rates, disease-free intervals, and symptomatic relief. However, patients in the orchiectomy group experienced a higher incidence of adverse effects, such as hot flashes, impotence, and decreased libido, compared to those in the estrogen therapy group.

"Pelvic pain: lessons from anatomy and physiology. Pelvic pain is a complex condition with various underlying causes, making it challenging to diagnose and treat effectively. This article aims to explore the anatomical and physiological aspects of the pelvis that contribute to the understanding of pelvic pain. The pelvic region houses vital organs such as the bladder, uterus, and rectum, which are interconnected through a network of nerves and blood vessels. Understanding the intricate anatomy of these structures, including their physiological functions, is crucial in identifying potential sources of pelvic pain. Dysfunctions in the musculoskeletal, neurologic, and vascular systems can all contribute to the perception of pelvic pain. By integrating knowledge of anatomy and physiology, clinicians can develop comprehensive treatment strategies to address the underlying etiology and provide relief to patients suffering from pelvic pain.",1
"Dietary management of acute childhood diarrhea: optimal timing of feeding and appropriate use of milks and mixed diets. The optimal timing of feeding and appropriate use of milks and mixed diets in the dietary management of acute childhood diarrhea were investigated. A total of 200 children aged 6 months to 5 years with acute diarrhea were included in the study. The children were randomly assigned to two intervention groups: early feeding group and delayed feeding group. The early feeding group received oral rehydration solution (ORS) along with breastfeeding or age-appropriate solid foods immediately after diagnosis, while the delayed feeding group received ORS alone for the first 24 hours. The results showed that early feeding was associated with a significantly shorter duration of diarrhea compared to delayed feeding (mean difference 0.7 days, p<0.001). There were no significant differences in the frequency of vomiting or the occurrence of complications between the two groups. In terms of milk type, both breast milk and specially formulated milks were found to be suitable for diarrhea management, while mixed diets were not recommended due to their higher osmolarity and potential adverse effects on gut function. Overall, this study highlights the importance of early feeding and appropriate milk choices in the management of acute childhood diarrhea.",1
"Small bowel phytobezoar mimicking presentation of Crohn's disease. A 42-year-old female presented with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and tenesmus that lasted for several months. The symptoms and radiographic findings raised concerns for Crohn's disease. However, further investigation revealed a large small bowel phytobezoar as the cause of her symptoms. This was successfully removed via endoscopic intervention. Phytobezoars are rare in the small bowel and often present with nonspecific symptoms, making diagnosis challenging. This case highlights the importance of considering phytobezoar as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with symptoms mimicking Crohn's disease, particularly in those with a history of poor mastication or ingestion of high-fiber foods. Early recognition and appropriate intervention can prevent unnecessary procedures and guide appropriate management.",1
"Child care practices with respect to acute respiratory tract infection in a poor, urban community in Nigeria. This study aimed to investigate child care practices related to acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in a poor, urban community in Nigeria. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among caregivers of children under five years old. Information regarding child care practices, including breastfeeding, hand hygiene, and use of traditional remedies, was collected through structured interviews. The prevalence of ARTIs among the children was also assessed.

The results showed that breastfeeding rates were suboptimal, with only 45% of children exclusively breastfed for the recommended six months. Hand hygiene practices were poor, with less than 30% of caregivers reporting regular handwashing before food preparation or feeding. Interestingly, traditional remedies were commonly used by caregivers for treating ARTIs, with 70% reporting the use of herbal preparations.

These findings highlight the need for targeted interventions to improve child care practices in this community. Emphasizing the importance of exclusive breastfeeding, promoting proper hand hygiene, and providing education on evidence-based treatment options can potentially reduce the burden of ARTIs among young children in resource-poor settings.",1
"Pathogenesis of antigen-induced arthritis in mice deficient in neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G. III. Neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G are proteases released by activated neutrophils and play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of antigen-induced arthritis (AIA). This study aimed to investigate the contribution of neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G in AIA by using mice deficient in these proteases.

Mice lacking neutrophil elastase (NEKO) and cathepsin G (CGKO) were compared to wild-type (WT) mice in their response to antigen-induced arthritis. Joint swelling and histopathological changes were evaluated after receiving intra-articular injections of methylated bovine serum albumin (mBSA). NEKO and CGKO mice exhibited significantly reduced joint swelling and histopathological changes compared to WT mice. Furthermore, reduced neutrophil infiltration and decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines were observed in NEKO and CGKO mice.

These findings suggest that neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G are critical mediators in the pathogenesis of AIA. Inhibition of these proteases may provide potential therapeutic interventions for the treatment of arthritis.",1
"Prospective payment system and impairment at discharge. Prospective payment systems (PPS) have been implemented in healthcare settings to provide a standardized method of reimbursement for medical services. However, there is limited research on the impact of PPS on patient outcomes, particularly in terms of impairment at discharge. This retrospective study aimed to assess the relationship between PPS and impairment at discharge in a sample of hospitalized patients. 

Data from electronic health records of patients discharged from a hospital between 2015 and 2017 were analyzed. Impairment at discharge was measured using a standardized assessment tool. PPS status was determined based on the reimbursement mechanism used for each patient. 

Results showed that patients under PPS had a higher prevalence of impairment at discharge compared to those under fee-for-service payment systems. This association remained significant after adjusting for potential confounders such as age, comorbidities, and length of hospital stay. 

These findings suggest that PPS may be associated with increased impairment at discharge, highlighting the need for further research on the impact of reimbursement systems on patient outcomes. Improved understanding of this relationship can inform policy decisions aimed at optimizing healthcare delivery and patient outcomes.",1
"Flow cytometric DNA content of adenoid cystic carcinoma of submandibular gland.  Correlation of histologic features and prognosis. The authors conducted a study to evaluate the relationship between flow cytometric DNA content, histologic features, and prognosis in patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) of the submandibular gland. Twenty-three patients with ACC were included in the study. Flow cytometry was performed on tumor specimens to assess DNA content. Histologic features, including tumor grade, perineural invasion, and lymphovascular invasion, were correlated with DNA content. The findings revealed a significant association between DNA content and tumor grade, perineural invasion, and lymphovascular invasion. Patients with high DNA content had higher tumor grade and increased rates of perineural invasion and lymphovascular invasion. Furthermore, patients with high DNA content had a poorer prognosis compared to those with low DNA content. This study highlights the potential utility of flow cytometric DNA content as a prognostic marker in ACC of the submandibular gland.",1
"Compressive neuropathy of spinal nerve roots. Compressive neuropathy of spinal nerve roots is a common condition that can cause significant pain and functional impairment. This study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis and management of this condition. Twenty patients with clinically suspected compressive neuropathy of spinal nerve roots were included in the study. All patients underwent high-resolution MRI of the spinal cord and nerve roots. The MRI images revealed a variety of findings, including nerve root compression, foraminal stenosis, and nerve root thickening. These findings were consistent with the patients' clinical symptoms and correlated well with the physical examination findings. MRI was found to be a valuable tool in the diagnosis of compressive neuropathy of spinal nerve roots, allowing for accurate localization and assessment of the extent of nerve root involvement. This information can guide treatment decisions and improve patient outcomes.",1
"Prognostic significance of proteinuria one year after onset of diarrhea-associated hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Proteinuria, characterized by the presence of excess protein in urine, has been recognized as a significant marker for renal dysfunction and poor prognosis in various renal disorders. However, its prognostic significance in diarrhea-associated hemolytic-uremic syndrome (D+HUS) remains unclear. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of proteinuria one year after the onset of D+HUS. Medical records of 117 pediatric patients with D+HUS were reviewed, and clinical and laboratory data were collected. Proteinuria was measured using a urinary protein/creatinine ratio. Results showed that patients with persistent proteinuria one year after D+HUS onset had a significantly higher incidence of acute kidney injury, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease compared to those without proteinuria. Furthermore, persistent proteinuria was associated with a poorer renal outcome and increased risk of renal replacement therapy. These findings emphasize the importance of monitoring proteinuria in D+HUS patients to identify those at higher risk of renal complications and to tailor their management accordingly.",1

Vaginal epithelial abnormalities are commonly observed in patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). However, there is limited information available on the clinical and pathological features of these abnormalities, as well as their optimal management. In this study, we aimed to investigate the characteristics and treatment options for vaginal epithelial abnormalities in patients with CIN. A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients diagnosed with CIN and concurrent vaginal epithelial abnormalities between 2005 and 2015. The clinical and pathological features of these cases were examined, and various management strategies were evaluated. The results revealed that the majority of patients presented with abnormal vaginal discharge and itching, with a significant association between the extent of vaginal epithelial abnormalities and the severity of CIN. Treatment options included local excision, laser ablation, and vaginal trichloroacetic acid application. Overall, effective management of vaginal epithelial abnormalities in patients with CIN requires a comprehensive approach that considers both the clinical and pathological aspects of the condition.",1
"Effect of exposure of miners to aluminium powder. Exposure to aluminium powder has been associated with various respiratory ailments and occupational hazards in miners. This study aims to investigate the effects of aluminium powder exposure on the respiratory health of miners. A cohort of miners exposed to aluminium powder and a control group of non-exposed individuals were recruited for this study. Detailed medical histories, including respiratory symptoms and lung function tests, were collected from both groups. The results showed a higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms, such as cough, shortness of breath, and wheezing, in the exposed group compared to the control group. Additionally, lung function tests revealed a significant decline in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) in the exposed group. These findings suggest that exposure to aluminium powder is associated with respiratory impairment in miners and highlights the need for effective preventive measures to minimize exposure and protect the respiratory health of workers.",1
