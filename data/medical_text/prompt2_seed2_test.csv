"Percutaneous urinary diversion in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Twenty-two patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer underwent percutaneous urinary diversion; at the time, all but one had metastatic disease. Eleven patients received postnephrostomy therapy. The median survival time for all the patients was one hundred nineteen days. Overall, 41 percent of the patients' remaining lifetime was spent in the hospital. Six never left the hospital and 10 required rehospitalization; the remaining 6 patients were never rehospitalized. The median survival time for this group of patients was shorter than the expected survival of similar patients without ureteral obstruction. It appears that percutaneous urinary diversion does not improve the quality of life of these patients. ",0
"Histologic evaluation of the larynx in sudden infant death syndrome. Seventy-four larynges removed at death from children who died of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) have been studied by serial sectioning in the transverse plane. An increase in subepithelial glandular tissue is seen in many specimens, and the reduction in the available subglottic area has been measured with the Measuremouse Image Intensifying system. This preliminary report confirms that in some of these children with SIDS, particularly around the age of 3 months, there is a potentially lethal reduction in subglottic airway secondary to an increase in mucus-secreting glands, possibly from an associated mild upper respiratory tract infection. Accepting that adequate control infants within this age group who have not had any trauma to the laryngotracheal area are not available, these findings offer a possible explanation for what are always tragic events.

"Immunohistologic properties of benign and malignant mixed tumor of the lacrimal gland. We studied the immunohistopathologic features of normal lacrimal gland, benign mixed tumor, and malignant mixed tumor of the lacrimal gland. Primary antisera were to keratin, muscle-specific actin, vimentin, and glial fibrillary acid protein. Keratin stained in occasional myoepithelial cells in normal gland, ductal epithelium in normal gland and the tumors, and occasional stromal epithelioid cells in the tumors. Muscle-specific actin stained in myoepithelium and vascular smooth muscle in normal gland and the tumors, and occasional spindle-shaped and clusters of stromal cells in the tumors. Vimentin staining was nonspecific. Glial fibrillary acid protein stained in occasional myoepithelial cells in normal gland and polyhedral stromal cells in benign mixed tumor. Our findings indicate that ductal epithelium develops into the epithelial component, and some cells in the stroma and myoepithelium develop into some cells in the stroma of benign and malignant mixed tumor of the lacrimal gland.

"Collagen metabolism in gynecologic patients: changes in the concentration of the aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen in serum. We have previously found the serum concentration of the aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen, an indicator of collagen metabolism, to be increased in advanced ovarian cancer. In this study we measured the serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen concentration in healthy women during the menstrual cycle and in patients with salpingo-oophoritis, leiomyomas, endometriosis, and benign ovarian tumors. The concentration was higher in the luteal phase than that in the follicular phase, suggesting an association of collagen metabolism with ovarian steroid hormones. Severe salpingo-oophoritis increased the serum level of the aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen with a decrease to normal during recovery. Elevated values were occasionally seen in endometriosis and leiomyomas. These findings indicate that the aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen is a relatively unspecific indicator of ovarian carcinoma. ",0
"Elevated soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels in patients with active multiple sclerosis. The level of soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) was quantitated with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in serum and cerebrospinal fluid obtained from 24 patients with multiple sclerosis and 10 patients with other neurological disorders in whom immunological mechanisms are unlikely to participate. The sIL-2R level in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with multiple sclerosis in relapse was significantly higher compared with patients with multiple sclerosis in remission and with controls. The sIL-2R level, especially in the cerebrospinal fluid, showed higher sensitivity and specificity than other clinical parameters including the cerebrospinal fluid IgG ratio, peripheral lymphocyte CD4/CD8 ratio, cerebrospinal fluid myelin basic protein and oligoclonal bands. Our data suggest that measurement of the sIL-2R level may be useful in evaluating disease activity in patients with multiple sclerosis. ",0
"Further evaluation of radical surgery following radiotherapy for advanced parotid carcinoma. A series of 30 patients who have been treated for advanced carcinoma of the parotid gland using radiotherapy followed by radical surgery is presented. Three patients deteriorated during preoperative radiotherapy and remained unfit for surgery; the remaining 27 underwent radical parotidectomy with block dissection of the neck. Twelve patients received additional radiotherapy after operation. Of those patients undergoing surgery, three have been lost to follow-up, 17 have died and seven remain alive; the period of follow-up ranges from 3 to 133 months. Fourteen patients remained free of recurrent disease at death or when last seen, and six patients developed a local recurrence at a medium period of 10.5 (range 3-36) months after surgery. For all 30 patients, the cumulative proportion surviving for 5 years was 30 per cent. ",0
"Does auxiliary heterotopic liver transplantation reverse hypersplenism and portal hypertension? In this study, performed to assess the effect of auxiliary heterotopic liver transplantation on portal hypertension and hypersplenism, eight patients with chronic liver disease who underwent the procedure and had functioning grafts for at least 6 months were analyzed. The transplantation resulted in (a) normalization of platelet and leukocyte counts, (b) reduction of splenomegaly by 20% +/- 3% (P less than 0.02), (c) disappearance of ascites, and (d) diminution of esophageal varices in all patients. Intraoperatively, the mean portacaval pressure gradient decreased with 54% +/- 7% after recirculation of the graft (P less than 0.05). In conclusion, a functioning auxiliary heterotopic liver graft decompresses portal hypertension and reverses hypersplenism. ",0
"Interphase cytogenetic analysis in the diagnosis and study of neoplastic disorders. Cytogenetic information usually is obtained through the direct analysis of chromosomes from cells arrested in metaphase. Recently, advances in molecular genetics have made it possible to acquire cytogenetic information through the study of interphase and terminally differentiated cells. By using chromosome-specific DNA probes or probes that are specific for certain chromosomal regions, and by employing techniques of in situ hybridization along with nonradioactive detection methods, it is now possible to detect numerical and structural chromosomal abnormalities from nonmetaphase cells. When used as an adjunct to conventional cytogenetic analysis or when used together with knowledge of established cytogenetic findings for a particular malignancy, this new technology can serve to broaden the scope and utility of cytogenetic analysis beyond the limits of the present metaphase-based technology. Interphase cytogenetic analysis has application to the diagnosis and study of neoplastic disorders and, thus, has particular importance in pathology. ",0
Unusual haemostasis for an unusual tumour. Catastrophic bleeding from a tactile neurofibroma affecting the thoracic vertebrae. Case report. The symptomatology of a typical acute descending thoracic aorta dissection was imitated by profuse haemorrhage caused by a benign tumour composed almost exclusively of Wagner-Meissner like tactile corpuscles and fatty tissue. The tumour caused extensive destruction of the bodies of the fifth and sixth thoracic vertebrae at the level of the vertebro-costal articulation. Emergency cross clamping of the descending aorta and haemostasis of the bleeding from osteal defects by tamponade with bone polymethyl methacrylate appeared the only way to control the life threatening haemorrhage. It seems that an intrathoracic tactile neurofibroma with a similar case history has not been reported till now. ,0
"Functional heart replacement with the spindle pump: first results. The spindle pump is a nonpulsatile blood pump with a double function, i.e., it works centrifugally and represses simultaneously. The first experiences with this type of pump used as a biventricular assist device in four short-term animal experiments (up to 13 hours) are described. It can be demonstrated that in cases of a normally beating heart, this BVAD decompresses both ventricles by 60-70%, while the aortic pressure is slightly increased; on the other hand, in case of ventricular fibrillation, the BVAD with two spindle pumps maintained the entire circulation, at an arterial pressure between 80 and 90 mmHg with a flow volume between 3.5 and 4 L/min.

"Memory-contingent saccades and the substantia nigra postulate for essential blepharospasm. Essential blepharospasm and cranial dystonia are related focal dystonias of unknown aetiology. Blepharospasm induced by acute dopamine depletion in parkinsonism restricts saccade initiation possibly via the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr). If essential blepharospasm and cranial dystonia similarly restrict saccades, then a selective, somatotopically arranged pathway such as the SNpr may be involved. To test this possibility memory-contingent and visually-guided saccades were measured in patients with essential blepharospasm and cranial dystonia. The latency of both forms of saccades was either significantly prolonged or excessively variable, while the accuracy and peak velocity of these fast eye movements were similar to age-matched control subjects. Essential blepharospasm and cranial dystonia alter the initiation of saccadic eye movements. Subcortical brain regions or pathways where eyelid, saccade and cranial/cervical motor control are somatotopically approximated, such as the SNpr, may be involved in blepharospasm. ",0
"Pressor systems in hypertension and congestive heart failure. Role of vasopressin [clinical conference] Elevated peripheral vascular resistance, which characterizes hypertension and congestive heart failure (the latter regardless of absolute blood pressure level) is maintained to a large extent by the combined effects of three major neurohormonal pressor mechanisms: the renin-angiotensin system, the sympathoadrenal system, and arginine vasopressin. Blockade of one of these mechanisms may lead to compensatory stimulation of the others, thus offsetting in part the hemodynamic benefits of a specific intervention. Combination therapy, designed to attack all three systems (with use of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, a sympathetic blocker such as clonidine, and an antagonist of the vasopressor action of vasopressin), may help in the treatment of such cases. To illustrate this strategy, two experimental studies, one case of malignant hypertension, and one case of congestive heart failure are presented. ",0
A dentist's dilemma: nonsurgical endodontic therapy or periapical surgery for teeth with apparent pulpal pathosis and an associated periapical radiolucent lesion. First presented is a brief review of nonsurgical versus surgical treatment of radicular cysts. This is followed by a consideration of the use of radiographs for differential diagnosis of periapical radiolucent lesions. Some of the nonendodontic local and systemic lesions that can occur periapically are then presented. Next examined are the fallibilities of pulp vitality testing methods. The need for histopathologic examination of periapical lesions is the subject of the next discussion. The dentist's dilemma is then examined: should teeth with apparent pulpal pathosis and an associated periapical radiolucent lesion have routine surgical treatment including biopsy or should they be treated nonsurgically and have periodic follow-ups? A possible resolution of this dilemma is the final consideration. ,0
"Inhibition of neutrophil migration by tumor necrosis factor. Ex vivo and in vivo studies in comparison with in vitro effect. Coincubation of neutrophils with TNF inhibited the chemoattractant-directed migration of neutrophils under agarose and enhanced their migration in the multiwell chemotaxis chamber. To assess the physiological significance of these differing in vitro TNF effects, ex vivo and in vivo investigations were performed using animal models. Neutrophils from the peripheral blood of rabbits preadministered systemic TNF showed impaired ability to migrate toward chemoattractants in vitro. In addition, systemic TNF administration suppressed zymosan-activated plasma-induced local accumulation of leukocytes in mouse skin. The results indicate that circulating TNF may act as a suppressor for local inflammatory reaction. ",0
"Right ventricular infarction: a clinical case study. In this article we review the specific case of Mrs. F., a 63-year-old white woman who recently had classical right ventricular infarction associated with left ventricular inferior wall myocardial infarction. The presentation covers her medical history, clinical course pathophysiology of the right ventricular infarction, and goals of the medical modalities used in treatment. Nursing problems are identified specifically related to right ventricular infarcts, and treatment considerations are discussed. A brief conclusion recaps Mrs. F.'s discharge course and reviews some specific problems associated with right ventricular infarcts, of which critical care nurses need to be aware. ",0
"Apparent reduction in the size of one side of the face associated with a small retrosplenial haemorrhage. A 68 year old Japanese female with unilateral metamorphopsia of the face that developed after a small haemorrhage in the contralateral retrosplenial region, is described. The patient claimed that the right side of a face, that is, the left side when looked at by the patient, appeared smaller than the left. In addition, her drawings of the face showed some distortions. Objects other than the face were perceived normally. Cranial CT scan revealed a small high density area in the right retrosplenial region. The face appears to have a special representation in the posterior hemisphere. ",0
"Open-heart surgery in Jehovah's Witnesses. During a 7-year period, 11 adult members of the religious sect Jehovah's Witnesses underwent cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation. No homologous blood transfusions were given. Blood-conserving procedures were employed, viz. initial collection of autologous blood, haemofiltration or processing (Cell Saver) of blood collected during extracorporeal circulation and reinfusion of shed mediastinal blood. The total perioperative blood loss averaged 1080 ml (15 ml/kg body weight), equalling 19% of total body blood volume. The mean haemoglobin on discharge from hospital was 11.0 g/100 ml. There was no perioperative mortality. Postoperative pulmonary function was good and there was no serious morbidity. Jehovah's witnesses with serious, surgery-necessitating heart disease can be offered operation comprising recognized blood-conserving procedures. ",0
"The use of gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging to determine lesion site in traumatic facial paralysis. Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging has been used to evaluate 20 patients with surgically confirmed facial nerve lesions. When the nerve could be seen, gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging accurately revealed the lesion site as well as the known extent, which in some cases was not predicted by topognostic testing. This technique appears to provide accurate lesion-site testing and may have importance in surgical planning. Currently used topognostic tests of facial nerve function are frequently inaccurate and can only determine the most proximal lesion site when there are multiple or extensive lesions. The focal nerve enhancement seen in nerve injury, globally increased signal intensity within the temporal bone after trauma, and increased signal intensity within the dura after surgery can occasionally mask nerve lesions and may be confused with tumors.

"Laser placement in noncontact Nd:YAG cyclophotocoagulation. We treated 40 eyes of 40 patients by using noncontact transscleral Nd:YAG cyclophotocoagulation to determine whether treatment 1.5 or 3.0 mm posterior to the corneoscleral lumbus was preferable. Patients were randomly assigned to one of the treatment groups, and all other variables, including power, number, and distribution of laser applications, were kept constant. Six months postoperatively, those treated 1.5 mm posterior to the corneoscleral limbus had a lower intraocular pressure (P = .0047) than those treated 3.0 mm from the corneoscleral limbus. The 1.5-mm group also required fewer retreatment (P = .017) and had a slightly lower occurrence of visual acuity loss after this procedure. We believe it may be advantageous to locate the laser application approximately 1.5 mm posterior to the corneoscleral limbus, rather than further posteriorly, when performing noncontact transscleral Nd:YAG cyclophotocoagulation.

"Relationship of ischemic heart disease to sudden death. A clinicopathological synthesis is presented of the relationship of ischemic heart disease to sudden cardiac death. The immediate pathophysiological process responsible for sudden cardiac death is a lethal arrhythmia, usually ventricular fibrillation. Although significant coronary atherosclerosis is present in most cases of naturally occurring sudden death, available evidence indicates that several mechanisms can be operative in the pathogenesis of the fatal event. These are (1) acute myocardial infarction in a minority of cases; (2) myocardial ischemia, without infarction, which is initiated either by (a) an exertion-induced increase in myocardial oxygen demand or (b) an acute coronary event often involving plaque degeneration and platelet aggregation; and (3) a primary arrhythmia, usually resulting from altered electrical conduction in the setting of a previous myocardial infarction.

"Spontaneous renal rupture during pregnancy. Spontaneous rupture of the renal parenchyma or renal pelvis during pregnancy has been previously reported in 16 cases. In the case we describe in this report, the patient initially had right flank pain and nausea for 48 hours, which progressed to severe abdominal symptoms that necessitated exploratory laparotomy. Cystoscopic placement of a ureteral stent relieved the obstruction and allowed spontaneous healing of the renal pelvis. Dilatation of the urinary collecting system commonly occurs during pregnancy. Spontaneous rupture of the renal parenchyma or renal pelvis, however, is unusual and often associated with diseased kidneys. Our case is the 8th one of spontaneous rupture of the renal collecting system with no identifiable underlying pathologic condition and the 17th case of spontaneous renal rupture overall. ",0
"Transient cyst-like cortical defects following fractures in children. Medullary fat within the subperiosteal haematoma. Asymptomatic cyst-like cortical defects appearing after fractures in children have been occasionally reported. Typically, these defects appear during fracture consolidation, within the newly formed subperiosteal bone, proximal to the fracture line, do not enlarge, and progressively disappear. We have previously shown a fatty density on CT scan within the early cortical defect. We now present two additional cases in which early CT scans appeared to confirm that these transient cortical defects may consist of fat, and probably result from the inclusion of medullary fat within the subperiosteal haematoma.

"Cervicography for evaluating the ""atypical"" Papanicolaou smear. A study was designed to compare various case-finding procedures in the evaluation of patients with an ""atypical"" Papanicolaou smear. Six hundred eighty-one consecutive patients were referred to the Denver General Hospital Colposcopy Clinic for smears showing evidence of atypical nuclear and/or cytoplasmic changes insufficient to justify a cytologic diagnosis of dysplasia. A full colposcopic evaluation with appropriate directed biopsies was carried out on all the patients. Fourteen percent of the patients demonstrated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), and 29% had condyloma without CIN. Both cervicography and the colposcopist's impression, though not ideal, were superior to a repeat smear, human papillomavirus typing or both. Cost effectiveness criteria and ease of training appear to justify the use of cervicography in the evaluation and triage of patients with atypical Papanicolaou smears. ",0
"Comparison of characteristics of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma associated with head and neck cancer and those with gastric cancer. In ongoing reviews of 339 patients with surgically treated primary squamous cell carcinoma, there were 19 (5.6%) with concurrent gastric cancer and 11 (3.2%) with head and neck cancer. The incidences of intra-esophageal multiple occurrence of esophageal cancer are 27.3% and 26.3% in those with associated head and neck cancer and gastric cancer, respectively, and higher than 7.1% in those without such a concurrent cancer. There was no difference in the clinicopathological characteristics of those with concurrent head and neck and gastric cancers, except for the higher incidence of metachronous occurrence in the former. These findings suggest that, in cases of esophageal cancer associated with concurrent head and neck cancer and gastric cancer, intraesophageal multiplicity of the esophageal carcinoma is frequent and that preoperative serial evaluations is most important to design treatment and estimate the prognosis.

"Hypocalcemia and hypercalcitoninemia in critically ill children. To study Ca metabolism in critically ill children, we measured ionized Ca (Ca2+), parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcitonin, 25 hydroxycholecalciferol (25[OH] D3), 1-25 dihydroxycholecalciferol (1-25[OH]2D3, and gastrin levels in critically ill children and in healthy controls. Patients were considered hypocalcemic if Ca2+ was less than 1.1 mmol/L. Six (14%) of 45 patients were hypocalcemic. Five hypocalcemic patients were studied and were found to have higher calcitonin levels than normocalcemic patients and healthy controls and higher PTH levels than healthy controls. 25(OH)D3 and 1-25(OH)2D3 were not significantly different in the three groups of patients. Gastrin levels were low in critically ill patients, whether or not they were hypocalcemic. We conclude that hypocalcemia occurs frequently in critically ill children. It is associated with raised levels of calcitonin and PTH. The mechanism for the increase in calcitonin is unknown. ",0
"Tissue expansion in the treatment of pressure ulcers. The authors report their experience using skin expanders in 11 patients with severe bed sores. The expanders, with different volumes, from 250 to 1000 cc, were generally overfilled using the cutaneous tonometer. In fact, with the information revealed by this apparatus on the skin in expansion, the authors were able to reduce the filling intervals without risking ulceration. In their experience, the results obtained were satisfactory: All patients treated achieved surgical recovery. The authors see a wide future for skin-expander use in pressure-ulcer treatment. They have a working hypothesis about using expanders to progressively advance sensitive skin in areas subject to ulceration. This hypothesis is based on the possibility of reexpanding the same flap several times, as has been seen in the treatment of other types of pathology. ",0
"Ganglioglioma: a clinical study with long-term follow-up. Gangliogliomas are uncommon tumors of mixed neoplastic glial and neuronal elements. Because of their low incidence, few large series exist that fully describe the clinical characteristics of patients afflicted with this tumor. We have reviewed the medical records of 20 patients at Duke University Medical Center with histologically proven gangliogliomas. These patients typically presented within the first three decades of life and their most common presenting symptom was seizures. Therapies included surgical resection, either partial or total, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy. Long-term follow-up was achieved by chart review and by telephone interview. Patients who underwent gross total resection alone seemed to fare the best when comparing all treatment groups, and we therefore recommend this as the main form of treatment. ",0
"Novel antigens characteristic of neuroendocrine malignancies. The authors describe the immunochemical detection, biochemical characterization, and tissue distribution of neuroendocrine antigens recognized by three newly developed monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) obtained after immunization of mice with the variant small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell line NCI-H82. RNL-1 was reactive with neuroendocrine tissues similar to the SCLC cluster-1 MoAb, known to recognize N-CAM. Antibodies RNL-2 and RNL-3 are directed against different epitopes on the same proteinaceous complex. Both MoAb recognize an intracellularly located, water-soluble antigen which has a subunit composition with a protein triplet ranging in molecular weight between 44 and 45 kilodaltons (kD) next to a component of approximately 30 kD. The antibodies RNL-2 and RNL-3 reacted with a subset of neuroendocrine tissues and neuroendocrine neoplasms. In lung cancer both antibodies reacted only with some SCLC and carcinoids and not with nonneuroendocrine lung carcinomas. The potential diagnostic applicability of antibodies RNL-1, RNL-2, and RNL-3 is discussed. ",0
"A cellist with arm pain: thermal asymmetry in scalenus anticus syndrome. We report on a cellist with pain and coldness of the upper extremity. Abnormal thermographic studies were instrumental in uncovering intermittent compression of the subclavian artery, and this prompted us to study the effects of cello playing on skin temperature asymmetry. Temperature asymmetry was defined as the temperature difference (delta-T) from one hand to the other. In 57 controls, mean delta-T at rest was .309 +/- .254C. Exercising the upper extremities by prolonged elbow flexion or by movements mimicking cello playing in controls did not significantly affect delta-T. In our patient, delta-T was ten times control (3.6C). Angiography showed extrinsic compression of the subclavian artery occurring only after cello playing; sympathetic ganglion block relieved the pain. Our patient's abnormal skin temperature may have reflected sympathetic vasomotor hyperactivity. Intermittent neurovascular compression and sympathetic hyperactivity appear to be factors in scalenus anticus syndrome. ",0
"The progression of mild idiopathic dementia in a community population. Thirty-one subjects aged 75 years and over who were identified as suffering from mild, idiopathic dementia in a large community survey were reviewed at annual intervals for 2 years. Diagnoses and severity ratings were based on defined criteria following a mental state examination, a medical and psychiatric history, detailed cognitive testing, and an interview with relatives or other key informants. Fourteen subjects became more severely demented within 2 years. The initial cognitive test battery failed to reveal any differences between respondents whose dementia advanced and those whose condition remained unchanged, but, in the former group, subjects' symptoms had been present for longer, and a greater proportion had been recognised as demented, or possibly demented, by their general practitioners. We suggest that subjects whose dementia progressed had actually been more severely disabled at the time of identification. ",0
"Renal disease in noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Diabetic nephropathy now accounts for approximately one-third of all patients who develop end-stage renal disease. The estimated cost to supply renal replacement therapy for this population now exceeds $750 million. The relatively recent realization that half of these individuals suffer from noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus has sparked increased interest in attempts to understand the pathologic processes involved and how they may be similar or different from those alterations seen in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Basic and clinical investigation continues in an attempt to solve the puzzle of pathogenesis, as well as answer questions about the clinical usefulness of microalbuminuria and the appropriate management of hypertension in this population.

"Cellular internalization, transport, and esterification of iodine-125-NP59 by MA-10 Leydig tumor cells. The present studies were directed toward understanding the cellular processing of the cholesterol analogue, NP59. NP59 readily entered MA-10 Leydig tumor cells. The cholesterol analogue entered the cells by binding to the plasma membrane and becoming internalized along with plasma membrane cholesterol. Internalized NP59 was readily esterified to NP59 ester. Transport of NP59 within the cell was indistinguishable from transport of cholesterol. Cholesterol and NP59 transport were under the control of cAMP, however, only cholesterol entered the mitochondria and was converted into progesterone. Thus, internalized NP59 could not be removed from the cell by conversion into steroid hormones. Esterified NP59 was metabolically inert and could not be converted back to free NP59 and free fatty acid. Since NP59 was not a substrate for the cholesteryl ester hydrolase, it became trapped in the cell as NP59 ester. ",0
"Thoracic spinal fractures and aortic rupture: a significant and fatal association. We analyzed the frequency of occurrence of traumatic aortic rupture (TAR) in patients with and without thoracic spinal fractures. Among 4,676 blunt chest trauma victims admitted to the hospital between 1972 and 1988, 148 (3.2%) suffered one or more thoracic vertebral fractures. There were 73 patients with one or more fractures of the first eight thoracic vertebrae (T1 to T8); of these 73, 4 also suffered TAR (5.5%). There were 4,603 patients without fractures of T1 to T8, and 64 of these patients also suffered TAR (1.4%). This difference was significant by the chi2 and Fisher exact tests, p = 0.00378 and p = 0.021003, respectively. Additionally, all 5 patients with TAR and thoracic vertebral fractures died. We conclude that patients with one or more fractures of T1 to T8 have a statistically significant increase in the incidence of TAR. ",0
"Use of gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis and management of posterior fossa hemangioblastomas. The diagnosis of central nervous system hemangioblastoma as well as the surgical treatment requires the accurate radiologic visualization of both the cystic and solid components of the tumor. We report two cases of posterior fossa hemangioblastoma examined with gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, which clearly defined the tumor nodule that was not visualized on noncontrast magnetic resonance imaging, contrast-enhanced computed tomography scans, or angiography. In both cases the operative findings precisely correlated with the gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance image. Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging is the examination of choice for preoperative evaluation of posterior fossa hemangioblastoma. In cases of von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, magnetic resonance imaging is a useful tool for clinical screening as well as follow-up. ",0
"Prognostic factors for survival of patients with advanced urothelial tumors treated with methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin chemotherapy. Between February 1983 and February 1986, 132 patients with advanced urothelial tract tumors were treated with methotrexate, vinblastine, Adriamycin (doxorubicin), and cisplatin (M-VAC) chemotherapy. Analysis of prognostic factors for survival of the first 92 patients was undertaken using the Cox proportional hazards model. Normal alkaline phosphatase and high Karnofsky performance status (KPS) were predominant for long survival. Patients 60 years or older at initiation of therapy were likely to survive longer than younger patients, perhaps indicating physician selectivity of older patients for this therapy, and those with initial hemoglobin in the normal range were also likely to survive longer. The additional 40 patients' data were used to validate the model. Clinical implications of the prognostic factors are discussed. ",0
"Brain protection: physiological and pharmacological considerations. Part I: The physiology of brain injury. Ischaemia, whether focal or global in nature, produces a sequence of intracellular events leading to increased cell permeability to water and ions including Ca++. There is a loss of cellular integrity and function, with increased production of prostaglandins, free radicals, and acidosis with lactate accumulation. These events may be exacerbated by glucose administration. Pharmacological agents aimed at alleviating ischaemic injury could be directed at decreasing cerebral metabolic requirements for oxygen, improving flow to ischaemic areas, preventing Ca+(+)-induced injury, inhibition of free radical formation, lactate removal, inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, and prevention of complement-mediated leukocyte aggregation. Part I of this paper describes some of the pathophysiological events leading to ischaemic brain injury. Part 2 of this paper will consider the current agents available for brain protection. ",0
"Metastatic tumors of the umbilicus: a review 1830-1989. Umbilical metastases from known and unknown primary cancers are rare. The eponym ""Sister Mary Joseph's nodule"" has been used by generations of physicians. The first reports of this clinical sign were from Walshe in 1846. A review of the literature revealed 265 cases from then until 1989. Only 85 cases of umbilical metastasis from unknown primary tumors were found. This review should help us to focus on the common and uncommon primary sites in the diagnosis of patients with this finding. A single case report and the work-up for the hidden primary tumor are described. ",0
"The pharmacology of aspirin, heparin, coumarin, and thrombolytic agents. Implications for therapeutic use in cardiopulmonary disease. The modern treatment of cardiopulmonary disease is increasingly predicated on the goal of dissolving the offending clot to establish vascular patency as rapidly as possible and then preventing rethrombosis. The availability of thrombolytic agents has made this therapeutic approach possible and the adjunctive use of heparin, coumarin, and aspirin has increased the efficacy of lytic drugs. The administration of any of these medications is associated with inherent risks, which are enhanced when they are used concomitantly. An understanding of coagulation and an appreciation of the pathophysiologic processes of the thrombotic events occurring in cardiopulmonary disease states are critical to the formulation of innovative therapeutic regimens that maximize efficacy and safety. Furthermore, knowledge of the comparative pharmacology of the various thrombolytic agents is useful in explaining the benefits and complications observed in clinical trials. ",0
"Cheilitis granulomatosa: report of six cases and review of the literature. Six cases of cheilitis granulomatosa, a rare inflammatory disorder of unknown origin, are reported. The condition produces nontender, persistent swelling of one or both lips and affects primarily young adults. Histologically, nonnecrotizing granulomatous inflammation is seen. The clinical findings and results of therapy in these six cases are presented. One patient was treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate (Plaquenil) that stabilized the process. One of our patients had vesicular-appearing lesions. Microscopic examination showed the lesions to be dilated superficial lymphatic channels, a finding that to our knowledge has not been previously described. ",0
"Steroids induce acetylcholine receptors on cultured human muscle: implications for myasthenia gravis. Antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor (AChR), which are diagnostic of the human autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis, block AChR function and increase the rate of AChR degradation leading to impaired neuromuscular transmission. Steroids are frequently used to alleviate symptoms of muscle fatigue and weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis because of their well-documented immunosuppressive effects. We show here that the steroid dexamethasone significantly increases total surface AChRs on cultured human muscle exposed to myasthenia gravis sera. Our results suggest that the clinical improvement observed in myasthenic patients treated with steroids is due not only to an effect on the immune system but also to a direct effect on muscle. We propose that the identification and development of pharmacologic agents that augment receptors and other proteins that are reduced by human genetic or autoimmune disease will have broad therapeutic applications.

"Trapped-lung syndrome after cardiac surgery: a potentially preventable complication of pleural injury. A case of trapped-lung syndrome after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is presented. A significant pleural injury occurred during the bypass operation resulting in intrapleural hemorrhage, pleural fibrosis, and trapped-lung syndrome. The physicians caring for the patient when she was first seen with the trapped-lung syndrome were unaware of the potential relationship between the two prior bypass surgeries to this pulmonary complication. Recognition of the potential for pleural injury to occur after cardiac operations is important and may allow for earlier diagnosis and institution of appropriate therapeutic interventions. Early recognition and treatment with pleural fluid drainage and reexpansion of the collapsed lung may help prevent this potentially serious pleuropulmonary complication from occurring. In addition, the presentation of this pleuropulmonary complication may be delayed after the cardiac surgery, making early diagnosis more problematic. ",0
"Preoperative selection for curable renovascular hypertension. Clinical research has defined the criteria for identifying ""curable"" renovascular hypertension. The prediction is based on the measurement of plasma renin activity in peripheral veins, renal veins, and the aorta. Renin profiles can be examined with the method of Laragh and coworkers (the so-called incremental method), in which values for plasma renin activity are incorporated into formulas to compute indexed parameters. A score is attributed to each index and the prediction is based on the final score. Because the identification of curable renovascular hypertension is made according to numerical rules, the method is easily transformed into a computer-assisted process. The program is written in BASIC, and it is short enough to run on a personal computer. ",0
"Myeloproliferative disorders. Classification and diagnostic features with special emphasis on chronic myelogenous leukemia and agnogenic myeloid metaplasia. Leukocytosis, mild anemia, thrombocytosis, and panhyperplasia in the marrow characterize the early stages of most of the CMPD, whereas extramedullary hematopoiesis (such as in the spleen or liver), peripheral cytopenias (anemia, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia), and myelofibrosis, with or without osteosclerosis, reflect the changes seen in the later stages. Transitions among the different CMPD and termination in acute leukemia or marrow failure also are common. CML often is characterized by leukocytosis and the presence of the entire spectrum of granulocytes (mature and immature) in the blood and marrow, reduced LAP, hypercellularity with prominent granulocytic hyperplasia in the marrow, Ph chromosome, and bcr-abl gene rearrangement. Typical features of AMM include leukoerythroblastosis, teardrop poikilocytosis, anemia, increased or normal LAP, prominent megakaryocytic hyperplasia in the marrow, dyshematopoiesis, and hyperplastic or fibrotic/sclerotic marrow.

"Congenital angiotropic lymphoma (intravascular lymphomatosis) of the T-cell type. The autopsy of a stillborn infant showed an extensive intravascular proliferation of atypical cells throughout the body. There was no infiltration by these cells of the parenchyma of the bone marrow, lymph nodes, or thymus. By histochemistry, these cells were negative for naphthol-ASD-chloroacetate esterase, a marker of granulocytes. By immunohistochemistry, they were reactive with MT-1 and anti-Leu-22, but unreactive with MB-1, L26, anti-Leu-M1, Tu-9, and antihemoglobin antibodies. A few cells reacted with antileukocyte common antigen and UCHL-1. Based on these findings, the lesion was diagnosed as angiotropic lymphoma (intravascular lymphomatosis) of the T-cell type, which occurred congenitally. Most angiotropic lymphomas in the literature are of the B-cell type, and no leukemia virus type I antibody was negative in the mother. ",0
"Lack of change in neurochemical markers during the postepileptic phase of intrahippocampal tetanus toxin syndrome in rats. The chronic epileptic syndrome induced by injecting tetanus toxin into rat hippocampus causes functional changes that essentially are permanent, outlasting the period of active seizures by at least 1 year. These long-term changes have been characterized by an impaired performance on a range of behavioral tasks, which in turn have been associated with a physiologic depression of hippocampal evoked responses but not with any discernible histopathology. In the present study, we examined the hippocampi of rats in the postseizure phase of the tetanus toxin model and observed no significant changes in the concentration of neurochemical markers for six neurotransmitters. Therefore, the long-term reduction in hippocampal excitability cannot be attributed to any major loss of afferents or hippocampal neurons using aspartate, acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, norepinephrine (NE), or serotonin as their transmitters.

"Two urogenital sinus syndromes. Interstitial cystitis and focal vulvitis. Forty-six young women had unusual and presumably noninfectious disorders of unknown etiology involving tissues derived from the embryonic urogenital sinus (urogenital sinus syndromes). Ten women had interstitial cystitis, and 25 had focal vulvitis. Eleven women had both interstitial cystitis and focal vulvitis. The affected groups were similar in demographic and other characteristics. Most were white and in their mid-20s. Both unusual conditions occurred in the same woman more often than could be expected by chance. This observation suggests that some common, perhaps autoimmune mechanism may be involved in the etiology of these syndromes. ",0
"Complications in percutaneous transluminal angioplasty: relationships with patient age. Five hundred consecutive attempted lower limb angioplasties for ischaemic disease (370 patients, mean age 65.6 years, range 33-91 years) were reviewed. Significant complications occurred in 44 cases (8.8%). Nine patients (1.8%) underwent emergency surgery related to a complication. A further 12 patients (2.4%) underwent elective surgery related to a complication. In addition, four patients died within 30 days of the procedure; one following surgery performed because of a complication of angioplasty, one following a myocardial infarction, one following severe bleeding associated with subsequent thrombolytic therapy and one during emergency surgery related to a complication of angioplasty. A correlation was found between complication rate and age. This relationship was independent of the approach to, the position of, and the severity of the treated lesion. Elderly patients are at increased risk of complication in lower limb angioplasty. ",0
"Hepatic arterial embolization in cases of extensive celiac arterial stenosis. Transarterial hepatic embolization was attempted in 10 and succeeded in nine patients with hepatocellular carcinoma accompanied by extensive celiac arterial stenosis. All catheterization was done through the femoral artery. In six cases, the tip of the catheter (2.5-F ball-tip microcatheter in three cases, 4-F ball-tip supple catheter in three cases) was placed in the proper hepatic artery through the pancreaticoduodenal collaterals. In three cases, a ball-tip microcatheter was injected from the guiding catheter, which was placed in a pinhole of the celiac trunk. These techniques involving flow-guided ball-tip catheters are of great value for hepatic arterial catheterization in cases of extensive celiac arterial stenosis. ",0
"Gallbladder carcinoma producing human chorionic gonadotropin. A primary carcinoma of the gallbladder producing human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) was encountered in an 83-yr-old Japanese woman, with elevation of HCG/beta-HCG in urine and serum. Remarkable elevation of serum estradiol was an associated finding, with increased HCG. At autopsy, we found that the primary carcinoma of the gallbladder extensively involved the liver. Histologically, the tumor revealed adenosquamous cell carcinoma in the primary site, and moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma in metastatic foci. Immunohistochemical staining for beta-HCG showed a positive reaction in adenocarcinoma components. This is an extremely rare case of an HCG-producing gallbladder carcinoma, which leads us to speculate that HCG-positive tumor cells may occur due to dedifferentiation. ",0
Unusual haemostasis for an unusual tumour. Catastrophic bleeding from a tactile neurofibroma affecting the thoracic vertebrae. Case report. The symptomatology of a typical acute descending thoracic aorta dissection was imitated by profuse haemorrhage caused by a benign tumour composed almost exclusively of Wagner-Meissner like tactile corpuscles and fatty tissue. The tumour caused extensive destruction of the bodies of the fifth and sixth thoracic vertebrae at the level of the vertebro-costal articulation. Emergency cross clamping of the descending aorta and haemostasis of the bleeding from osteal defects by tamponade with bone polymethyl methacrylate appeared the only way to control the life threatening haemorrhage. It seems that an intrathoracic tactile neurofibroma with a similar case history has not been reported till now. ,0
"Unilateral hydrocephalus in adults. The authors report 14 cases of unilateral hydrocephalus in adults. Headache was the most common presenting symptom. Unilateral hydrocephalus was documented in each patient with computed tomography scans; magnetic resonance imaging was also used in seven patients in the latter part of the series. Unilateral hydrocephalus was caused by tumor (seven patients), venous angioma (one patient), ependymal cyst (one patient), postinflammatory gliosis (one patient), and was idiopathic in four patients. The primary surgical treatment was craniotomy with fenestration of the septum pellucidum, which relieved symptoms in eight of nine patients for whom long-term follow-up data were available. ",0
"Immunoscintigraphy of ovarian cancer with indium-111-labeled OV-TL 3 F(ab')2 monoclonal antibody. The safety and diagnostic accuracy of immunoscintigraphy with the indium-111-labeled monoclonal antibody OV-TL 3 F(ab')2(111In-OV-TL 3 F(ab')2) for diagnosis and follow-up of ovarian cancer was prospectively studied in 31 patients. Planar and SPECT scintigraphy were performed up to 4 days after i.v. injection of 140 MBq 111In-OV-TL 3 F(ab')2. Surgical evaluation was possible in 22 out of 31 patients. Imaging results were compared with X-ray computed tomography, ultrasound, and CA 125 serum level using the histologically confirmed surgical findings as a ""gold standard."" Apart from a transient rash observed in two patients, no other immediate or delayed adverse reactions were observed. Within the surgically evaluated group, ovarian cancer lesions were detected in 16 out of 17 patients (94%). Of 45 distinct tumor deposits found at operation, 67% were detected and localized with immunoscintigraphy while X-ray computed tomography and ultrasound visualized 53% and 23%, respectively. ",0
"Hemodynamic determinants of vascular changes in hypertension and atherosclerosis. Several new concepts are reviewed concerning structural and functional changes in atherosclerotic and hypertensive blood vessels. First, in regard to modulation of vascular changes, atherosclerosis appears to progress more slowly during hypotension than during normotension. This finding may have implications for the optimal level of blood pressure. Second, structural ""remodeling"" of the vessel wall occurs in both atherosclerosis and hypertension. Remodeling helps to preserve the arterial lumen despite intimal proliferation in atherosclerosis. In contrast, remodeling (which differs from vascular hypertrophy) reduces the vascular lumen in chronic hypertension. Third, functional changes impair active vasodilator responses in both atherosclerotic and hypertensive vessels, in part by endothelium-dependent mechanisms. Finally, we propose that leukocytes as well as platelets may be important cellular mediators of spasm in atherosclerotic arteries. ",0
"Absent or minimal cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities in Haemophilus influenzae meningitis. A case of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) meningitis in which the diagnosis and treatment were delayed because of normal cerebrospinal fluid analysis is presented. A retrospective review was conducted at two children's hospitals to determine the frequency and clinical characteristics of patients with Hib meningitis whose spinal fluid had a normal total white blood cell count, normal chemistries, and negative Gram stain, but subsequent growth of Hib in culture. Of 379 cases of Hib meningitis, two had completely normal CSF, and two had CSF containing small numbers of polymorphonuclear cells as the sole abnormality. In three of the four cases, the duration of symptoms was less than 24 hours, and appropriate therapy was significantly delayed because of benign-appearing CSF. Normal CSF cell counts, chemistries, and Gram stain do not exclude the possibility of bacterial meningitis, and one should remain suspicious when a child has clinical findings suggesting meningitis.

"Ventricular arrhythmias in ischemic heart disease. Ventricular arrhythmias remain the leading cause of death from coronary artery disease. This review summarizes current thinking in several areas relating to the pathophysiology, prognosis, and therapy of ventricular arrhythmias associated with acute and chronic coronary artery disease syndromes. The experimental basis of arrhythmias in the setting of acute myocardial ischemia and chronic myocardial infarction is described, stressing the important pathophysiologic differences between these two conditions. The effects of the autonomic nervous system as a key modulator of ischemic arrhythmogenesis are discussed. Insights, derived from endocardial mapping studies, into the nature of ventricular tachycardia in humans with chronic myocardial infarction are described, including implications for risk stratification and therapy to prevent arrhythmia recurrence. Current therapeutic principles are discussed in the management of ventricular arrhythmias associated with coronary artery disease, including pharmacologic approaches, surgical and catheter ablation, and automatic implantable cardioverting and defibrillating devices.

"Internal fixation of femoral neck fractures. Two methods compared. In a prospective randomised study, the Hansson pin technique for internal fixation of fractures of the femoral neck was compared with the Uppsala screw technique. The series consisted of 115 consecutive patients, 97 women and 18 men, with a mean age of 80 years. There were 56 patients treated with Hansson pins and 59 with Uppsala screws. After one year 22 patients had died, eight in the Hansson pin group and 14 in the Uppsala screw group (p = 0.28). Twenty-four complications had occurred, 18 in the Hansson pin group and six in the Uppsala screw group (p = 0.008). After exclusion of those with complications, the patients in the Hansson pin group had significantly more pain, less mobility, and a smaller proportion were living in their own homes. ",0
"Narrow QRS ventricular tachycardia. OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency and clinical characteristics of narrow QRS ventricular tachycardia (QRS duration less than or equal to 0.11 seconds). DESIGN: Consecutive survey of patients with ventricular tachycardia. SETTING: Tertiary, referral-based arrhythmia service at a university medical center. PATIENTS: Sequential sample of patients with inducible ventricular tachycardia who had a 12-lead electrocardiogram of the tachycardia available for review. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 106 patients with ventricular tachycardia, 5 (4.7%; 95% CI, 2.1% to 10.6%) had ventricular tachycardia with a QRS duration less than or equal to 0.11 seconds. Three of the five patients were previously incorrectly diagnosed as having supraventricular tachycardia. All five patients had at least two electrocardiographic findings other than QRS duration to suggest ventricular tachycardia. CONCLUSIONS: Narrow QRS ventricular tachycardia should be considered in the differential diagnosis of narrow QRS tachycardias. Electrocardiographic findings other than QRS duration are usually present to suggest the diagnosis. ",0
"Incidence of hairy cell leukemia, mycosis fungoides, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia in first known HTLV-II-endemic population. Unlike human T cell leukemia-lymphoma virus type I (HTLV-I), HTLV-II has not been convincingly linked to a malignancy. In the first 10 months of serologic screening for HTLV-I/II among blood donors in New Mexico in 1988-1989, HTLV-I/II infection was found in 27 donors. HTLV-I/II infection was present in 1.0%-1.6% of American Indian and 0.16%-0.27% of Hispanic donors compared with 0.009%-0.06% of non-Hispanic white donors. HTLV-II was identified by DNA amplification in 12 of 13 samples from Indian and Hispanic seropositive donors. Despite apparent endemic HTLV-II infection in these populations, New Mexico Tumor Registry data showed that the incidences of hairy cell leukemia, mycosis fungoides, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia were comparable among the three ethnic groups. A population with endemic HTLV-II infection has been identified, and there is no evidence of increased risk for these three malignancies in the endemic groups. ",0
"Postictal psychosis after partial complex seizures: a multiple case study. Bouts of unusually frequent partial complex seizures originating in the temporal lobe, that sometimes became secondarily generalized, induced psychotic episodes in 9 patients. In 7, the increase in seizures occurred at a time when antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were being reduced during intensive EEG monitoring with a view to surgical treatment of intractable epilepsy. According to DSM-III-R criteria, the postictal psychosis resembled an organic delusional syndrome which was paranoid in 7 and schizophreniform in 1 and an organic mood syndrome in 1. A high incidence of ictal fear, of bilateral independent epileptogenic discharge, and of small foreign tissue lesion were unexpected findings and appeared to represent risk factors, especially in patients otherwise handicapped by an epileptic personality disorder. Recognition of postictal psychosis in this setting and in others is important both prognostically and therapeutically. Postictal psychosis does not constitute a contraindication to surgical treatment of epilepsy. ",0
"Expandable biliary metal stents for malignancies: endoscopic insertion and diathermic cleaning for tumor ingrowth. Seventeen patients with malignant biliary strictures have been treated by endoscopic insertion of self-expandable metallic prostheses. Two patients received two prostheses inserted simultaneously in both the left and right hepatic ducts for Klatskin tumor type III. Immediate results were satisfactory despite an operative mortality of 18%, and neither early nor late clogging was observed even in patients who presented previously with sludge above plastic stents that were removed. However, among five patients followed for more than 4 months, two presented with obstruction due to tumor ingrowth into the stent through the metallic mesh. Accordingly, initial enthusiasm concerning long-term patency of these stents has decreased. However, we describe a technique of ""diathermic cleaning"" of tumor ingrowth which can easily restore the stent patency. The advantages of these wire mesh 30 F stents are their easier insertion, better immediate drainage, and absence of dislocation or perforation. ",0
"Age-related hypotensive effect of placebo and active treatment in patients older than 60 years. European Working Party on High Blood Pressure in the Elderly. Elderly hypertensive patients were randomly assigned to active treatment (n = 365) or placebo (n = 377). The effects of treatment on blood pressure were calculated by subtracting pretreatment blood pressure from the blood pressure at 3 months. In the two treatment groups, the decrease in systolic and diastolic pressures was more pronounced in older patients. However, the slopes of blood pressure change with age were not significantly different in the two treatment groups: systolic, -0.47 and -0.37 mm Hg/year in the active-treated and placebo patients, respectively; diastolic, -0.26 and -0.15 mm Hg/year, respectively. Thus, proving that an observed age-related hypotensive effect is caused by a particular drug requires comparison with a control group on placebo. ",0
"Improved silver staining of nucleolar organiser regions in paraffin wax sections using an inverted incubation technique [published erratum appears in J Clin Pathol 1991 Jun;44(6):528] A new simple modification to the silver staining of nucleolar organiser regions (AgNORs) was devised which, by performing the incubation with the slide inverted, results in minimal undesirable background staining, a persistent problem. Inverted incubation is facilitated by the use of a commercially available plastic coverplate. This technique has several additional advantages over other published staining protocols. In particular, the method is straightforward, fast, and maintains a high degree of contrast between the background and the AgNORs. ",0
"Endoscopic ethmoidectomy and maxillary antrostomy in immunodeficient patients. The efficacy of endoscopic sinus surgery was evaluated in 11 patients with diverse types of primary immunodeficiency disease and symptoms of chronic sinusitis. The postoperative symptoms and ability to eliminate antibiotics were used as outcome parameters. In two patients, the follow-up time was too short to assess therapeutic effectiveness. Five of the remaining nine patients had total or significant resolution of symptoms. Patients with transient immunodeficiency had the best resolution of symptoms. Eight of the total 11 patients were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin preoperatively, and in five patients, the treatment was continued postoperatively. The ability to terminate gamma-globulin reflects not the success of the surgery, but the transient nature of some of the immunodeficiencies. ",0
"Hypertensive heart disease in African-Americans. Hypertensive heart disease is a frequent complication in hypertensive African-Americans because of inadequate high blood pressure control. Moreover, African-Americans may be predisposed to develop LVH earlier in life and more readily than Caucasians, and it may be more malignant. The appearance of both LVH and congestive heart failure are ominous developments in individual patients, and early detection of LVH is mandatory for adequate management and reversal of this complication, if possible. Additional research is needed, and new, sensitive tools for detecting LVH will accelerate such studies. Further investigations are also needed on the reversibility of LVH, preferred antihypertensive agents for accomplishing reversal, and whether expected benefits result. ",0
"Cerebrospinal fluid endothelin-1 and endothelin-3 levels in normal and neurosurgical patients: a clinical study and literature review. Endothelins are a family of structurally related, potent, long-lasting vasoconstrictor peptides. There are no established normal human levels of endothelin-1 or endothelin-3 in the cerebrospinal fluid. We measured cerebrospinal fluid endothelin-1 and endothelin-3 levels in five groups of patients: normal controls, patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral vasospasm, patients with severe head injuries, patients undergoing temporal lobectomy for intractable epilepsy, and a patient with a gunshot injury to the thoracic spine. Endothelin-3 levels were significantly elevated in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and may participate in cerebral vasospasm and subsequent neurologic deterioration. ",0
"Different tumor-derived p53 mutants exhibit distinct biological activities. In its wild-type form, the protein p53 can interfere with neoplastic processes. Tumor-derived cells often express mutant p53. Full-length mutant forms of p53 isolated so far from transformed mouse cells exhibit three common properties in vitro: loss of transformation-suppressing activity, gain of pronounced transforming potential, and ability to bind the heat shock protein cognate hsc70. A tumor-derived mouse p53 variant is now described, whose site of mutation corresponds to a hot spot for p53 in human tumors. While absolutely nonsuppressing, it is only weakly transforming and exhibits no detectable hsc70 binding. The data suggest that the ability of a p53 mutant to bind endogenous p53 is not the sole determinant of its oncogenic potential. The data also support the existence of gain-of-function p53 mutants.

"Large diameter expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts for infrarenal aortic aneurysm surgery. The performance of an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft used for aortic aneurysm replacement was evaluated. ePTFE grafts were implanted in 241 patients undergoing infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. Sixty patients were operated as emergencies for aneurysm rupture and 181 electively. One hundred and fourteen bifurcated and 127 tube grafts were inserted. The transperitoneal approach was used in 64 cases and the remainder were placed using a retroperitoneal approach. There was a one-month mortality of 2.8% in elective and 20% in emergency cases. Median follow-up was 26 months. Specific graft complications included one infected graft resulting in a graft-enteric fistula. No graft rupture, degeneration, dilatation, pseudoaneurysm or late graft limb thromboses were observed in up to 7 years of follow-up. The aortic ePTFE prosthesis demonstrated satisfactory performance over the period studied. ",0
"The electrodiagnostic findings in polyneuropathies associated with IgM monoclonal gammopathies. Electrodiagnostic studies were analyzed in patients with neuropathy associated with IgM monoclonal proteins, 7 with anti-myelin associated glycoprotein reactivity (MAG) and 7 nonreactive to MAG. The findings were distinctly different in the two groups. The electrodiagnostic studies of all the MAG-reactive patients had demyelinating features with slowing of conduction and prolonged distal latencies while only one of the MAG-nonreactive patients had a demyelinating pattern. In fact, the MAG-nonreactive patients were a heterogeneous group, both electrodiagnostically and clinically. This study supports the concept that MAG-reactive polyneuropathy is demyelinating in type, and is caused by the activity of the IgM M-protein directed at an antigen in the myelin sheath. ",0
"Treatment of chronic facial palsy by transplantation of the neurovascularized free rectus abdominis muscle. We performed neurovascularized free rectus abdominis muscle transplantations in two patients with chronic facial palsy. In one patient, the postoperative course was uneventful, but the patient died from rupture of esophageal varices. In the other patient, both morphologic and functional results were satisfactory. Therefore, the rectus abdominis muscle is considered to be a suitable donor for muscle transplantation for the treatment of chronic facial palsy. The rectus abdominis muscle is advantageous in that (1) simultaneous operations by two teams are possible with the patient in the supine position, (2) it is supplied by long nerves and long and large vessels, (3) it is flat and consists of segments with appropriate lengths, (4) the force and distance of contraction are appropriate, and (5) the tendinous intersections are suitable for anchoring sutures.

"Association of immunoglobulin Km and Gm allotypes with specific antinuclear antibodies and disease susceptibility among connective tissue disease patients. The distribution of the immunoglobulin Km(1) and Gm phenotypes was examined in patients with connective tissue diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, mixed connective tissue disease, and scleroderma, whose sera were characterized for antibodies against nuclear antigens and polypeptides of U small nuclear ribonucleoproteins. We found a strong association between Km(1) phenotype and susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (P less than 0.00001, relative risk = 17). We also found a positive association between the Km(1) phenotype and the presence of anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies. The presence of certain immunoglobulin genes or gene families may have a role in susceptibility to the development of autoantibodies and/or of connective tissue disease. ",0
"Coronary collateral recruitment: functional significance and relation to rate of vessel closure. Studies in animals and humans have demonstrated the anatomic presence and functional significance of coronary collaterals. The extent of collateralization varies among species and among individuals. Collateral vessels are usually adequate for preserving resting regional and global ventricular function in the face of coronary obstruction. During stress, however, collateral supply may be inadequate. Collateral development is a time-dependent process during both the initial occlusion and following transient reflow and reclosure. Therefore when a previously collateralized coronary occlusion is recanalized and then recloses, the extent of the resulting collateral recruitment will depend, at least in part, upon the period of reflow between the two occlusions. The longer the reflow period, the less enhanced will be the collateralization. This is illustrated in the cases presented and has also been demonstrated in animal studies. The exact mechanisms for this recurrent collateral recruitment need further study. ",0
"Emergency center ultrasonography in the evaluation of hemoperitoneum: a prospective study. The reliability of ultrasonographic detection (US) of hemoperitoneum in blunt abdominal trauma was evaluated in a prospective study of 72 patients. Independent of the examiner, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were, respectively, 86.7%, 100%, and 97.2%. Laparotomy was indicated in 76.9% of US hemoperitoneum-positive cases. No negative laparotomies were performed in this study group. If hemoperitoneum is revealed in US and vital signs are unstable, we think laparotomy is indicated. We believe that US in an emergency center is a quick, safe screening method in the evaluation of blunt abdominal trauma. US might take over a great part of the role of diagnostic peritoneal lavage.

"Ichthyosis, mental retardation, and asymptomatic spasticity. A new neurocutaneous syndrome with normal fatty alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase activity. A number of inherited disorders of cornification have been related to abnormal lipid metabolism. In the recessively inherited Sjogren-Larsson syndrome, defined by the triad of ichthyosis, mental retardation, and spasticity, fatty alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase deficiency has recently been reported. These patients accumulate fatty alcohol in the plasma and cultured fibroblasts. A 19-year-old woman with ichthyosis, mental retardation, and mild spasticity is described in whom fatty alcohol metabolism was normal, as determined by plasma octadecanol level and fibroblast fatty alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase activity. Ultrastructural studies on skin from the patient revealed morphologically abnormal epidermal lamellar bodies, not unlike those seen in neutral lipid storage disease with ichthyosis. We postulate that this patient has a novel neurocutaneous syndrome that may be secondary to abnormal lipid metabolism. ",0
"Thoracoscopic treatment of spontaneous pneumothorax using carbon dioxide laser. In an effort to improve the success rate of the previously described thoracoscopic electrocautery ablation technique of spontaneous pneumothorax, the carbon dioxide laser was evaluated in 12 patients. The recurrent (5 patients) or persistent (7 patients) spontaneous pneumothoraces were caused by rupture of (1) blebs in 6 patients, (2) intrapulmonary apical type II bullae in 3 patients, and (3) diffuse bullous emphysema, type III, in 3. The air leaks were successfully sealed in all but 1 patient with ruptured type II bulla. Surgical specimen from this single failure suggested that the entire inner lining of the bullae must be thermocoagulated. This technical modification led to successful outcome in 2 subsequent cases. With the use of carbon dioxide laser, it was possible to treat not only small blebs but all types of bullae causing spontaneous pneumothorax. Laser thoracoscopy is effective and safe in treating spontaneous pneumothorax. ",0
"Incidence of gallstones in a Danish population. Five-year incidence of gallstone disease was assessed by ultrasonography in an age- and sex-stratified random population of Danish origin aged 30, 40, 50, and 60 years. The response rate was 82.8% (2987/3608). Nonrespondents did not differ from respondents regarding variables concerning gallstone disease. The 5-year incidence of gallstone disease in men aged 30, 40, 50, and 60 years was 0.3%, 2.9%, 2.5%, and 3.3%. Corresponding figures in women were 1.4%, 3.6%, 3.1%, and 3.7%. The incidence of gallstones was significantly higher in subjects aged 45 years or more compared with those aged 35 years. The sex difference in gallstone incidence decreased with increasing age. A significantly higher incidence of gallstone disease was found among subjects with former polyps in the gallbladder. Spontaneous disappearance of gallstones was seen in 4.5%. ",0
"Computerized neuropsychological assessment of cognitive functioning in children with epilepsy. The value of a range of computer-aided tests in the neuropsychological assessment was investigated in 94-177 children with epilepsy, aged 8-18 years, compared with 68-161 controls in the same age group. Children from the age of 8 years could cope with rather complex tests in a wide range of functions: reaction time measurements, motor speed, information processing, and memory. The speed of performance tended to increase with age in both groups, with differences in information processing becoming apparent from the age of 12 years. The precise control of stimulus and response required to define the mainly minor differences between the epilepsy and control groups can only be fulfilled by computerized testing, which should undergo further refinement including voice and language recognition, followed by artificial intelligence.

"Carcinoma of the ductus choledochus. A retrospective review of patients treated for carcinoma of the common bile duct has demonstrated improvement in diagnostic capabilities, leading to earlier management by resectional therapy. The ability to resect these tumors is directly translatable to improved long-term survival. Efforts to obtain proof of malignancy prior to resection are often frustrated by the inability to obtain adequate representative tissue for frozen section. Choledochoscopic biopsies and incisional biopsies have given the highest yield of positive diagnoses. In experienced hands, a program of fewer preoperative tests with emphasis on early operation, diagnosis, and definitive treatment may be more cost-effective in the management of patients with common bile duct cancer.

"Myotonic heart disease: a clinical follow-up. We followed 37 patients with myotonic dystrophy for a mean of 6 years. Two developed atrial flutter or fibrillation, 6 developed a new bundle branch block, 1 developed complete heart block requiring a pacemaker, and another with progressive 1st-degree heart block and a widening QRS interval had a sudden death. Most patients had predictable, gradually progressive disease of their cardiac conduction system. We recommend that patients with progressive atrioventricular block or widening QRS interval due to myotonic heart disease have yearly ECGs and be questioned about syncope or presyncope to determine the need for a cardiac pacemaker.

"Clinical significance of white cell antibodies in febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions. Febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTRs) are associated with white cell (WBC) antibodies. The purposes of this study were to determine the frequency of WBC antibodies, to associate the severity of reactions with antibody specificity, and to distinguish FNHTRs from infection and postoperative fever. By using the granulocyte indirect immunofluorescence test in conjunction with lymphocytotoxicity testing, it was found that 70 percent of FNHTRs in 24 patients involved WBC antibodies. The remaining 30 percent of apparent FNHTRs were associated with infections and postoperative fever. Granulocyte-specific antibodies were as prevalent as HLA antibodies and were associated with the severest reactions. Because FNHTRs occur with granulocyte-specific antibodies, HLA antibodies, and possible monocyte-specific antibodies (untested in this and other studies), these reactions could be grouped together as WBC-associated reactions.

"Evidence of a local immune activation in cystic brain tumors. The fluid of cystic brain tumors was characterized with regard to the protein content. In most malignant tumors, the concentrations of immunoglobulins G and M (IgG and IgM) were higher relative to other proteins in the cyst fluid than in the serum of the same patient. A markedly elevated ratio of monomeric to pentameric IgM was detected in the cyst fluid of two patients with glioblastomas. The results indicate a local immunoglobulin synthesis in malignant cystic brain tumors. It is hypothesized that higher-than-expected concentrations of IgG and IgM in cyst fluid as compared to plasma are a sign of an ongoing immune response triggered by the tumor. ",0
"Vegetables, fruits, and carotenoids and the risk of cancer. Low intake of vegetables, fruits, and carotenoids is consistently associated with increased risk of lung cancer in both prospective and retrospective studies. In addition, low levels of beta-carotene in serum or plasma are consistently associated with the subsequent development of lung cancer. The simplest explanation is that beta-carotene is protective. Since retinol (preformed vitamin A) is not related in a similar manner to lung cancer risk, beta-carotene appears to function through a mechanism that does not require conversion into vitamin A. However, the importance of other carotenoids and other constituents of vegetables and fruit has not been adequately explored. Both prospective and retrospective studies suggest that vegetable and fruit intake may reduce the risk of cancers of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, bladder, and cervix. But because of fewer studies and less consistency among studies, the epidemiologic evidence is at present less persuasive than for lung cancer. ",0
"Laser placement in noncontact Nd:YAG cyclophotocoagulation. We treated 40 eyes of 40 patients by using noncontact transscleral Nd:YAG cyclophotocoagulation to determine whether treatment 1.5 or 3.0 mm posterior to the corneoscleral lumbus was preferable. Patients were randomly assigned to one of the treatment groups, and all other variables, including power, number, and distribution of laser applications, were kept constant. Six months postoperatively, those treated 1.5 mm posterior to the corneoscleral limbus had a lower intraocular pressure (P = .0047) than those treated 3.0 mm from the corneoscleral limbus. The 1.5-mm group also required fewer retreatment (P = .017) and had a slightly lower occurrence of visual acuity loss after this procedure. We believe it may be advantageous to locate the laser application approximately 1.5 mm posterior to the corneoscleral limbus, rather than further posteriorly, when performing noncontact transscleral Nd:YAG cyclophotocoagulation.

"Evaluation of vigabatrin as an add-on drug in the management of severe epilepsy. The effects of the addition of Vigabatrin, a new anti-epileptic drug, to the therapy of 128 patients with severe medically refractory epilepsy is reported. Forty two (33%) of patients experienced side effects, which were predominantly neurotropic. In 28 (22%), the drug was withdrawn because of these side effects. The commonest side effects were drowsiness and behavioural change. The remaining 100 patients were followed for a mean of 30 weeks (range 12-75). Forty one of these patients showed a marked improvement in seizure frequency (a 50% or more reduction when compared with the pre-trial period), and nine (7%) were rendered seizure free. Apparent tolerance to the effects of the drug were noted in five patients. An exacerbation of seizures may occur if the drug is withdrawn too quickly. Vigabatrin appears to be a promising new anti-epileptic drug. ",0
"Environmental risk factors in siblings with Parkinson's disease. To investigate possible risk factors in Parkinson's disease, we conducted a case-controlled study of 19 families having two or more siblings with Parkinson's disease. Demographic data were collected, including lifetime histories of places of residence; sources of drinking water; occupations, such as farming; and exposure to herbicides and pesticides. Rural living and drinking well water, but not farming and herbicide exposure, were significantly increased in 38 parkinsonians compared with 38 normal control subjects. A comparison of parkinsonian siblings with siblings with essential tremor revealed no differences in any risk factors for the years of shared environment. These data suggest that living in a rural environment and drinking well water are risk factors for Parkinson's disease and that the total life exposure to an environmental toxin may be more important than exposure in early life.

"Periurethral colonic-type polyp simulating urethral caruncle. A case report. A 50-year-old, black woman presented with a 1-cm, polypoid lesion on the posterior edge of the urethral meatus that had the gross appearance of a urethral caruncle. The histologic features, however, revealed a superficially ulcerated lesion composed of colonic-type mucosal glands with focal regenerative atypia in response to inflammation. A similar histologic pattern is also found in so-called solitary rectal ulcer syndrome and inflammatory cloacogenic polyps arising in the anorectal area. Based upon an English-language literature review, this case appears to be the second reported one of an intestinal-type polyp in this location. The patient had no further problems after excisional biopsy. ",0
"Oxidation reactions in Parkinson's disease. Free radicals generated from oxidation reactions may contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Free radicals are capable of reacting almost instantaneously with membrane lipids and causing lipid peroxidation, membrane injury, and cell death. Dopamine is metabolized by oxidation reactions capable of generating free radicals. Recent evidence indicates that the substantia nigra of patients with PD contains increased iron, which enhances oxidation, and decreased glutathione, which protects against the formation of free radicals. Further, the end products of lipid peroxidation are increased in the substantia nigra of patients with PD, supporting the notions that free radicals are being generated and may contribute to dopamine neuronal death. This hypothesis suggests that antioxidant therapies may slow the rate of progression of PD and raises concern that metabolites of levodopa therapy may accelerate the rate of neuronal degeneration.

"Cosmetic, functional, independent: self-help aids. Self-help orthotics have been developed to assist functional activities for high-level spinal cord injured patients. The goal of rehabilitation has been to do this with as little intrusion on independence and cosmesis as possible. This paper describes devices to help a patient with C6 quadriplegia independently place his own utensils and eat with an almost normal appearance. The new self-help aids are made from standard silverware, a rivet, and two one-eighth-inch Kydex loops. The loops are riveted centrally on the utensil, allowing for free rotation. The device was evaluated on a patient with C6, complete quadriplegia. The subject demonstrated independence in donning and doffing the device and in eating with an almost normal appearance. ",0
"Surgical and prosthesis-related complications using the Groningen button voice prosthesis. Prosthesis-assisted tracheoesophageal speech has advanced speech rehabilitation appreciably. However, the surgical technique and the use of a prosthesis may give rise to complications. In a retrospective study on 132 consecutive patients rehabilitated with a Groningen button voice prosthesis, the complications were assessed, the average follow-up being 21 months. Surgical complications were not observed. Prosthesis-related complications, which were encountered in 28%, were all of a minor nature and mainly consisted of granulation formation and hypertrophic scarring; these appeared to be easily treatable. The complications found were few and insignificant in comparison with reports in the literature. This may be attributed to the uncomplicated surgical procedure for the insertion of the Groningen button. Moreover, the prosthesis is self-retaining and requires hardly any care from the patient. Permanent removal of the prosthesis usually requires surgical closure, which is a simple procedure performed under local anaesthesia. ",0
"The osteogenetic potential of fracture haematoma. Subperiosteal and intramuscular transplantation of the haematoma. We studied the precise role of the fracture haematoma in healing by the experimental transplantation of the haematoma at two days and four days after fracture of the rat femur to subperiosteal and intramuscular sites. We used bone marrow and peripheral blood haematomas for control experiments. The transplanted two-day fracture haematoma produced new bone by endochondral ossification at the subperiosteal site, but not at the intramuscular site. Four-day fracture haematoma produced new bone formation at both subperiosteal and intramuscular sites. These results suggest that fracture haematoma has an inherent osteogenetic potential. ",0
"Anisocoria in unilateral ophthalmic disease. Pupillary diameters in the affected and unaffected eyes of 327 patients with uniocular red eye were assessed during fixation of a distant target. The mean pupillary diameters were similar in the unaffected eyes in each of eight diagnostic groups, but were significantly different (F = 3.84, p less than 0.001) in the diseased eyes. With corneal abrasions (p less than 0.001), marginal keratitis (p less than 0.05), and acute anterior uveitis (p less than 0.001) the mean pupillary diameter for the affected eye was significantly smaller than that of the unaffected eye. The observed differences of pupillary diameter probably reflect the role of neuronal and autocoid mechanisms in the unilateral control of pupillary size. ",0
"Outpatient management of schizophrenia. As effective antipsychotic pharmacotherapy has become available, patients with schizophrenia are increasingly managed in an outpatient setting by primary care physicians. Pharmacotherapy is generally effective in treating ""positive,"" or psychotic, symptoms and lessening the risks of relapse, but ineffective in improving ""negative,"" or deficit, symptoms. Aggressive attempts to totally control positive symptoms and to ameliorate negative symptoms tend to increase side effects and may be detrimental to the patient. Intensive psychotherapeutic and rehabilitative approaches are generally unproductive. Attempting to obtain a cure is unrealistic. A moderate approach is recommended, taking into consideration the limitations of existing treatments, achieving control of extreme symptoms and minimizing social and occupational limitations. ",0
"Local failure and related complications after definitive treatment of carcinoma of the prostate by irradiation or surgery. The authors review their institution's experience with the failure of definitive treatment to achieve local tumor control and with the distant dissemination and local morbidity associated with such failure. The causes of local failure are various: incomplete resection, implantation of spilled cells, and, possibly, selective implantation of circulating tumor cells in traumatized tissues after surgery and totally or partially resistant cells, new tumors, or radiologic misses after radiation. Treatment of local failure may be prophylactic or therapeutic and differs depending on the stage of the disease. Failure to control the tumor locally in the presence of distant metastases does not alter the length of survival, but it can profoundly affect the quality of survival. ",0
"A comparative study of terbinafine versus griseofulvin in 'dry-type' dermatophyte infections. We conducted a double-blind comparative study of terbinafine, 250 mg twice daily, versus griseofulvin, 500 mg twice daily, for 6 weeks in chronic dermatophyte infections of the feet or hands. All but three patients (total 31) had Trichophyton rubrum infection. At 12-week follow-up, 100% of the terbinafine-treated group were free from infection compared with 45% of those treated with griseofulvin. Therapy in 75% of the terbinafine-treated group and in 35% of those given griseofulvin was rated as effective overall at long-term follow-up, although these differences were not statistically significant. Six months after treatment all nine patients whose skin had cleared with terbinafine therapy remained in remission versus only one of seven patients treated with griseofulvin. None of the patients in either group experienced serious adverse effects. ",0
"Degenerative lesions in the articular cartilage after meniscectomy: preliminary experimental study in dogs. Articular cartilage degeneration was studied in an experimental model including 68 knees of adult dogs on which five different types of medial meniscectomy had been performed with a followup period of 10 to 450 days. The results were assessed by macroscopic, radiologic, and histologic methods. The degenerative lesions increased proportionally to the amount of meniscal tissue resected and the duration of observation. These lesions proved to be more intense at the tibial plateau compared to the femoral condyle. For both joint surfaces the predominant location was the central zone. Considering the degenerative process by the articular cartilage after total meniscectomy, maximum preservation of meniscal tissue is recommended. ",0
"The use of bromodeoxyuridine cytokinetic studies as a prognostic indicator of cancer of the head and neck. Traditional measures of head and neck tumors often fail to predict patient outcome or clinical course, particularly in nonadvanced disease. This problem of unpredictable tumor behavior has been one focus of cell proliferation studies. Such studies, however, have been limited by difficult methodology. A newer method of quantifying tumor cell proliferation using bromodeoxyuridine is applicable for head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, as shown in the present study. The relative ease with which cell proliferation can be evaluated using this technique will allow large numbers of head and neck tumors to be studied, enabling correlations with tumor behavior to be made.

"Benign parotid tumors: a 24-year experience. The medical records of 125 patients benign parotid neoplasms surgically treated over a 24-year period were retrospectively reviewed; 128 tumors were excised. These included 90 pleomorphic adenomas, 33 Warthin's tumors, 3 benign lymphoepitheliomas, and 2 oncocytomas. The surgical procedures consisted of 2 local excisions, 6 enucleations, 88 superficial parotidectomies, 13 subtotal parotidectomies, and 3 radical parotidectomies. The morbidity rate was 49%. There was one total permanent facial nerve paralysis (0.7%), four (3%) partial permanent facial nerve paralysis, five (5%) transient total facial nerve paralysis, and 32 (25%) partial transient facial nerve paralysis. After a median follow-up of 84 months, there was one recurrence (0.7%). A superficial parotidectomy is the minimum procedure that should be performed for the treatment of a benign parotid neoplasm.

"Serum lipids and lipoproteins are less powerful predictors of extracranial carotid artery atherosclerosis than are cigarette smoking and hypertension The effect of serum lipids and lipoproteins on extracranial carotid artery atherosclerosis (CAS) was studied in patients who underwent carotid arteriography. Serum lipid and lipoprotein values along with data on other potential predictors of extracranial CAS were determined in 240 patients who had at least one extracranial carotid artery visualized. In a multiple logistic regression analysis, the independently significant predictors of the presence of extracranial CAS were, in decreasing order of significance, duration of smoking of cigarettes, hypertension, age, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Serum cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein A-I did not show an independent effect. Although low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was an independent predictor of the presence of extracranial CAS, its effect as a predictor was far outweighed by the effects of the duration of smoking of cigarettes and a history of hypertension.

"Evidence of a local immune activation in cystic brain tumors. The fluid of cystic brain tumors was characterized with regard to the protein content. In most malignant tumors, the concentrations of immunoglobulins G and M (IgG and IgM) were higher relative to other proteins in the cyst fluid than in the serum of the same patient. A markedly elevated ratio of monomeric to pentameric IgM was detected in the cyst fluid of two patients with glioblastomas. The results indicate a local immunoglobulin synthesis in malignant cystic brain tumors. It is hypothesized that higher-than-expected concentrations of IgG and IgM in cyst fluid as compared to plasma are a sign of an ongoing immune response triggered by the tumor. ",0
"Selection of patients with stage B prostate cancer for radical prostatectomy. There are several areas of concern in dealing with clinical stage B disease. First, understaging is common. Second, recognition of extension into the seminal vesicles is important. Third, the patient's predicted life expectancy must be taken into account. Moreover, even clinically localized prostate cancer may have metastasized, and the need for surgical staging by lymph node dissection has been a significant factor in the authors' preference for radical retropubic rather than radical perineal prostatectomy. Neither of the two serum markers in clinical use is an absolute predictor of stage. Analysis of tumor ploidy may prove useful, and transrectal ultrasound warrants further study. In the elderly patient, the urologist certainly may elect to monitor the tumor without definitely deciding on operative versus conservative treatment. ",0
"A new syndrome: hearing loss and familial salivary gland insensitivity to aldosterone in two brothers. Two male siblings presented in infancy with hyponatremia. The levels of plasma renin activity and aldosterone were elevated. Sodium supplement was necessary to maintain normal sodium balance. The salivary sodium concentrations were markedly elevated, with sweat sodium levels being in the upper normal range. Urinary sodium concentration and renal epithelial exchange between sodium and potassium were normal. This was felt to be due to an autosomal recessive disorder. Both siblings were later diagnosed as having a bilateral moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss with intermittent conductive overlay due to middle ear fluid. The sensorineural loss was also felt to be autosomal recessive in origin, but the possibility of a disturbance of sodium balance in the inner ear has been questioned. ",0
"Biliary pain in postcholecystectomy patients without biliary obstruction. A prospective radionuclide study. Biliary pain without obvious biliary obstruction is common in postcholecystectomy patients. We studied 20 symptomatic patients with episodes of biliary-type pain after cholecystectomy (all having undergone endoscopic retrograde cholangiography), and in 18 asymptomatic postcholecystectomy controls. We performed quantitative hepatobiliary radionuclide analysis with dimethyl-imidodiacetic acid. From a series of 90 dynamic images at 1-min intervals using a gamma camera coupled to a computer, time-activity curves were produced in regions of interest in the liver, intrahepatic biliary tree, common duct, and heart, from which quantitative biliary excretion indexes were obtained. The results demonstrate a biliary kinetic dysfunction in patients with postcholecystectomy pain without morphological abnormalities. ",0
"Neonatal diarrhea at a maternity hospital in Rangoon Between 1981 and 1986, 1,540 infants born at the Central Women's Hospital in Rangoon were transferred to the Sick Baby Unit because of diarrhea (15.4 per 1,000 live births). Rates among cesarean infants were five times as high as those of infants born vaginally (51.0 and 10.3 per 1000 live births, respectively). One hundred eighty-four of the infants with diarrhea died (case fatality rate = 12 percent). We conclude that neonatal diarrhea is endemic in this large maternity hospital in Burma, and that control efforts should be targeted especially to cesarean and low birthweight infants. ",0
"Heterogeneity in spasmodic dysphonia. Neurologic and voice findings. Spasmodic dysphonia is a disturbance of phonation with laryngeal spasms. We report voice and neurologic examination findings in 45 subjects. Neurologic abnormalities were found in 32 subjects (71.1%). Rapid alternating movement abnormalities, weakness, and tremor were common. Incoordination and spasticity were rare. Lower extremity findings were frequent. Abnormalities were bilateral. Spasmodic dysphonia severity was related to age. Type, severity, and duration of vocal symptoms were not different for subjects with or without neurologic abnormalities. Vocal tremor was more frequent in neurologically abnormal subjects. Involvement of a pallidothalamic-supplementary motor area system could account for neurologic findings, brain imaging findings, and clinical heterogeneity. The view emerging is that spasmodic dysphonia is a manifestation of disordered motor control involving systems of neurons rather than single anatomical sites. ",0
"Drug response of head and neck tumors in native-state histoculture. We describe a chemosensitivity testing of head and neck tumors, in which a native-state histoculture, ie, a three-dimensional culture system that maintains important in vivo properties, including tissue architecture, was used. Fifteen specimens of head and neck tumors were evaluated for sensitivity to the following drugs: cisplatin (DDP) at concentrations of 1.5, 15, and 37.5 micrograms/mL; fluorouracil at concentrations of 4.0, 40, and 100 micrograms/mL; and combinations of cisplatin and fluorouracil in corresponding doses. Growth and measurement of drug responses were successfully completed in 10 specimens (five others were contaminated, four of them prior to instituting rigorous antibiotic washes). The results indicated cisplatin sensitivity in five of 10 patients; fluorouracil sensitivity in four of 10 patients; and fluorouracil-cisplatin sensitivity in seven of eight patients. Our preliminary results indicate that the native-state histoculture technique is feasible to test chemosensitivity of head and neck tumors. ",0
"Blood pressure measurements during dental checkups representative of 26-hour registration. The effect of dental checkups on blood pressure was investigated. In 27 normotensive patients (13 men and 14 women) aged 22 to 64 years (mean 39.75 +/- 10.5 years), a 26-hour continuous, noninvasive blood pressure registration was carried out. Of each patient at least 175 blood pressure measurements were registered during these 26 hours, giving a total amount of 4725 blood pressure measurements. A dental checkup appointment with the family dentist was included. Blood pressure values displayed the well-known diurnal variation, but the visit to the dental surgeon was not accompanied by a rise in blood pressure. There was no significant difference between the blood pressure values during the 26-hour period and those during the checkup period. During a rest period after the dental checkup, neither the systolic nor the diastolic pressure fell to any degree in relation to the 26-hour values or the visit to the surgeon. ",0
"Central airway obstruction due to cytomegalovirus-induced necrotizing tracheitis in a patient with AIDS. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) can present as either disseminated disease, pneumonitis, retinitis, gastroenteritis, neuropathy, or a subclinical infection. We report a patient whose initial manifestation of CMV infection was severe central airways obstruction due to necrotizing tracheitis. At bronchoscopy, the lesion appeared deeply ulcerated, distinctly different from previously described airway lesions in patients with AIDS. Mucosal biopsies showed characteristic intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusions and cultures yielded only CMV. The patient responded partially to ganciclovir, steroids, and antibiotics against suspected anaerobic superinfection but died as a result of central nervous system disease believed due to toxoplasmosis or lymphoma. CMV infection of the upper airway should be considered in the patient with AIDS presenting with atypical cough or stridor and ulcerated endobronchial lesions. ",0
"Cerebrospinal fluid fistula and endoscopic sinus surgery. Seven cases of cerebrospinal fluid fistulae occurring as a result of endoscopic sinus surgery in a total of 800 ethmoidectomies are discussed, along with 1 case referred for consultation. One cerebrospinal fluid fistula was intrasphenoid, 4 were posterior ethmoid/base of skull, 2 were anterior ethmoid, and 1 was ethmoid cribriform. Six of 8 fistulae were closed endoscopically. The sphenoid sinus cerebrospinal fluid fistula was closed successfully with fibrin glue and Gelfoam. Five cerebrospinal fluid fistulae were closed successfully using fascia, muscle, and Gel-foam. Two cerebrospinal fluid fistulae were treated conservatively, and only 1 stopped. Anatomic and technical aspects related to the occurrence of cerebrospinal fluid fistulae are discussed. Management and treatment of cerebrospinal fluid fistulae occurring during and after endoscopic sinus surgery is emphasized. When identified intraoperatively or delayed, cerebrospinal fluid fistulae can be managed successfully by endoscopic technique. ",0
"Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease from allogeneic dura: a review of risks and safety. Surgeons and the lay public have recently expressed concern over the safety of allogeneic dura as it relates to the transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease. Indeed, two cases have resulted from use of tissue procured from a commercial agency that did not adhere to criteria accepted by the American Association of Tissue Banks or the Southeast Organ Procurement Foundation. This review discusses the risks and safety of allogeneic dura. The findings should reassure the surgeon of the safety of allogeneic dura when it is properly processed and catalogued by a bona fide, reputable tissue bank. To date, there have been no documented cases reported to the Center for Disease Control in which Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease was transmitted from allogeneic dura obtained from a registered tissue bank.

"Nitrite from inflammatory cells--a cancer risk factor in ulcerative colitis? Elevated levels of luminal nitrite and a lowered luminal pH were found in 77 percent of patients with acute ulcerative colitis. No luminal nitrite was found in healthy control subjects. Nitrites are a secretory product of activated macrophages and neutrophils of the lamina propria, whereas the lowered luminal pH is due to diminished bicarbonate formation by impaired colonocytes. A hypothesis is put forward that nitrites, lowered pH, and bacterial amines are conducive to formation of carcinogenic n-nitroso compounds, which reflect a cancer risk in patients with ulcerative colitis dependent on the type and extent of inflammatory cell activation as well as metabolic impairment of colonic epithelial cells.

"Isolated congenital stapes ankylosis: surgical results in 32 ears and a review of the literature. Isolated congenital stapes ankylosis is described in 32 operated ears from 28 patients. In 27 ears, a regular stapedectomy was performed. In the remaining 5 ears, 2 had stapes gushers, 2 had bony stapedial tendons, and 1 had an aberrant facial nerve crossing the oval window. The average individual hearing gain was 20 dB. The mean hearing gain for the 24 successful stapedectomies was 29 dB. In 24 of 32 ears (75%), an essential hearing gain of at least 15 dB Fletcher's index hearing threshold could be achieved. A Fletcher's index not exceeding 30 dB could be achieved in 19 of 32 ears (60%), in spite of several cases with a sensorineural component in the hearing loss. A review of the literature and overview of longer series with isolated congenital stapes ankylosis is presented. ",0
"Protective and curative effects of rifampicin in Acanthamoeba meningitis of the mouse. BALB/c mice inoculated nasally with Acanthamoeba culbertsoni, resulting in amebic encephalitis and death 3-7 days, were treated with rifampicin prophylactically (daily for 2 days with 75 and 100 mg/kg) and after infection (daily for 5 days with doses of 10-100 mg/kg). Prophylactic treatment resulted in full protection against infection, as assessed by absence of symptoms of central nervous system malfunction and negative brain culture 10 days after inoculation. Curative treatment was effective at the same doses; however, at doses of 10, 25, and 50 mg/kg, only two of six animals were free of symptoms and infection. ",0
"US-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy of gallbladder masses. Ultrasonically (US) guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy was performed in 88 patients who had gallbladder masses. All masses were less than 4.8 cm in diameter. A 22- or 23-gauge, Teflon-coated needle was placed into the mass with the transhepatic or transperitoneal route. By means of this technique, gallbladder malignancy was confirmed in 69 of the 78 cases of malignancy (88.5%). Ten of 10 benign lesions were properly categorized. One patient developed bile peritonitis following a single needle pass with the transperitoneal approach. Pain, a minor complication of the procedure, was noted in four cases. No instances of hemorrhage or vasovagal reactions occurred. From their experience in this large series, the authors conclude that US-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy of gallbladder masses is a safe, reliable, and accurate technique for the diagnosis of malignancy.

"Differences in the membrane interaction of scrapie amyloid precursor proteins in normal and scrapie- or Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease-infected brains. The membrane interaction and hydrophobicity of the normal (PrPC) and infectious isoform (PrPSc/CJD) of scrapie and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease amyloid precursor proteins was studied. The normal isoform of hamster and human scrapie amyloid precursor protein was found on the microsomal/synaptosomal membranes anchored solely by the C-terminal glycolipid. Glycolipid cleavage resulted in dissociation from the membranes and change of behavior from a highly hydrophobic to a hydrophilic protein, susceptible to proteases. In contrast, the PrPSc/CJD isoform was resistant to release by glycolipid-cleaving enzymes. A part of PrPSc/CJD was released from the membranes after prolonged trypsin treatment, yielding a further protease-resistant product of 27-30 kDa. The results demonstrate the proteolytic resistance of the membrane-bound PrPSc/CJD isoform and also indicate the presence of a different, apparently disease-induced mechanism of membrane interaction in the scrapie- and CJD-infected microsomal and synaptosomal membranes.

"Role of cell-mediated immunity to staphylococci in blepharitis. We studied cell-mediated immunity to staphylococcal antigens in 116 patients with chronic blepharitis and eight normal subjects. Antibodies in tears and blood were measured. Enhanced cell-mediated immunity to Staphylococcus aureus was demonstrated in 46 of 116 patients (40%) in the absence of antibodies to teichoic acid but not among normal subjects. Symptoms of grittiness and morning stickiness were more frequent among patients without enhanced responses. Folliculitis occurred more commonly among patients with enhanced immunity. Marginal keratitis occurred equally among patients with and without enhanced systemic immunity, but patients with enhanced response more commonly required topical corticosteroid therapy. Desensitization to staphylococcal antigens could be investigated as a potential therapeutic approach in selected patients. ",0
"Effects of acute ethanol ingestion and burn injury on serum immunoglobulin. Previous studies have found that acute ethanol ingestion before burn injury caused further impairment of mitogenic response of B lymphocytes compared with burn injury alone. The principal role of B lymphocytes is immunoglobulin production. This study was designed to determine the effect of acute ethanol ingestion on circulating immunoglobulin levels before injury. Serum concentrations of IgG, IgM, and IgA in rats were measured with the use of radial immunodiffusion plates at 4 days after a 30% burn injury in animals that had received a single ingestion of 3.0 ml ethanol per kilogram of body weight. The immunoglobulin levels were compared with appropriate controls. A 30% burn injury produced significant decreases in serum IgG and IgA levels but not in IgM levels, whereas acute ethanol ingestion only decreased IgA levels. Acute ethanol ingestion before injury did not induce any further significant decrease than did burn injury alone. ",0
"Closure of leaking filtering blebs with cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive. Five leaking filtering blebs, occurring between 10 months and 21 years after trabeculectomy, were closed with cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive. Filtering bleb integrity was preserved in four cases, so that additional microsurgery was avoided. The only problem associated with use of tissue adhesive was the development of corneal abrasions in three cases. Although it is an accepted treatment for these conjunctival fistulas, only nine previous cases have been reported to our knowledge. We strongly recommend the use of tissue adhesive as a presurgical treatment in the management of leaking filtering blebs which present as a late postoperative complication of glaucoma surgery. ",0
"Proximal posterior cerebral artery occlusion simulating middle cerebral artery occlusion. We describe 12 cases of acute stroke in which clinical features of proximal posterior cerebral artery occlusion simulated the clinical syndrome of middle cerebral artery occlusion. The majority of patients developed contralateral hemiparesis, homonymous hemianopia, hemispatial neglect, and sensory loss or sensory inattention. All 8 patients with dominant hemisphere lesions were aphasic. Accurate diagnosis in each case was achieved only after a head CT, showing occipital lobe, thalamic, and inferomesial temporal lobe infarction. ""Cortical"" signs are probably explained by thalamic involvement. Recognition of this syndrome has implications for management and prognosis. ",0
"Spinal cord inhibitory mechanisms in Parkinson's disease. We studied two spinal cord inhibitory mechanisms, recurrent (Renshaw) inhibition and reciprocal inhibition, in seven patients with asymmetric Parkinson's disease in order to determine their contribution to the pathogenesis of rigidity. Recurrent inhibition, studied in the leg, did not differ from that found in normal subjects. All three periods of reciprocal inhibition, studied in the forearm, were present but reduced in magnitude compared with those observed in normal subjects. The arms, whether more symptomatic or less symptomatic, gave similar results. The diminution of all three periods of reciprocal inhibition is similar to the findings in patients with dystonia and is apparently indicative of an abnormal supraspinal influence on spinal mechanisms in these two disorders of basal ganglia function.

"Effects of pill-giving on maintenance of placebo response in patients with chronic mild depression Fifty outpatients with mild, chronic, mood-reactive depression whose mood improved markedly after a 10-day single-blind placebo trial were randomly assigned in a double-blind design either to have their placebo medication discontinued or to have it maintained for an additional 6 weeks. Half of the patients in each condition relapsed within 6 weeks, indicating that pill-taking itself does not influence maintenance of placebo response. Placebo response was more likely to be maintained in patients who were currently married. At the end of 3 months, the overall relapse rate was 58%. The authors raise questions about the utility of the initial 10-day placebo washout in antidepressant clinical trials, and they discuss limits on the generalizability of their findings. ",0
"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the patient with cancer. The records of 114 cancer patients suffering cardiopulmonary arrests (CPA) during a 3-year period at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) were retrospectively reviewed to identify variables predicting final outcome in these patients. Although 65.7% of the patients were successfully resuscitated, only 12 (10.5%) were discharged alive from the hospital. Median survival after discharge was 150 days. By univariate and multivariate analysis, the only variable predicting the likelihood of a patient's being discharged alive after a CPA was the performance status of the patient at the time of admission to the hospital. Thus, a patient spending more than 50% of the time in bed at the time of admission had only a 2.3% chance of being discharged alive after CPA. A thorough discussion of these findings between physicians and patients and their families is strongly recommended at the time of admission to spare cancer patients unnecessary invasive resuscitative procedures.

"Ultrasonography in the differentiation of complicated and uncomplicated acute pyelonephritis. Differentiation of uncomplicated pyelonephritis versus complicated pyelonephritis has always been problematic. No clear physical signs or symptoms are diagnostic. To study differences between the two, we retrospectively reviewed charts of patients admitted to Charity Hospital, New Orleans, with febrile urinary tract infections. Criteria for inclusion were pyuria, positive urinary culture, and signs or symptoms of pyelonephritis. All patients underwent renal ultrasonography (US) before other diagnostic tests. US identified a potential emergency (hydronephrosis or abscess) in 11 of 98 patients (11.2%). The only significant contributing factor was the presence of diabetes mellitus, which was present in five of 11 emergent conditions and eight of 73 of the remainder (P = 0.003). US is inexpensive, easily obtainable in the emergency room, and sensitive enough to screen patients with pyelonephritis for complications. However, we believe it is mandatory in diabetics, because of the high incidence of abnormalities in this population. ",0
"Nondiagnosed left main ostial stenosis partly due to the use of 5 French coronary angiographic catheters. Two cases have been reported in which the use of 5 F angiographic catheters is associated with a failure to diagnose an ostial stenosis of the left main coronary artery (LMCA). In both cases, the erroneous diagnosis led to an inappropriate indication for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) on other stenosed vessels, and the ostial left main lesion was unexpectedly discovered when using 8F guiding catheters. It is supposed that the ability of performed 5F catheters to pass easily through an ostial lesion makes detection of such proximal stenosis much more difficult. We suggest that the choice of 5F catheters must be approached with caution when left main disease is potentially expected from the clinical features. ",0
"Moustache appearance in craniopharyngiomas: unique magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomographic findings of perifocal edema. This report describes two cases of craniopharyngioma with perifocal edema. In both patients, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that the tumors occupied the suprasellar cistern, invaginated the floor of the 3rd ventricle and were tightly adherent to the ventricular walls. The intraventricular portions of the tumors were cystic, containing protein-rich fluid as suggested by MRI and confirmed by operative findings. There was perifocal edema in the hypothalamus adjacent to the intraventricular tumor, the optic tracts, and the posterior limbs of the internal capsules, resembling the shape of a moustache on axial computed tomographic and MRI scans. The perifocal edema subsided after treatment of the intraventricular tumor by surgical resection or radiation therapy. The ""moustache"" appearance seems a unique, characteristic feature of perifocal edema, which is observed infrequently with certain craniopharyngiomas. ",0
"Germfree animals and technics in surgical research. Germfree animals have been reared to a size, weight, and age permitting the performance of major surgical procedures and the pursuit of a variety of surgical research problems. Germfree dogs have been maintained in the isolator system through three generations, indicating that life, reproduction, and growth are all possible in the absence of microbial contamination. The value of the germfree approach to surgical problems has been utilized in studies of a variety of gastrointestinal problems, shock, cancer, immunology, burns, wound healing, and in direct patient application. Patients have been maintained in isolator environments for prevention of infection, for operative procedures, for treatment of extensive burns, and for management of immune-suppressed individuals. We conclude that germfree animals and germfree technics provide a valuable addition to the armamentarium of the surgeon in both research and clinical applications. ",0
"Results of treatment of displaced patellar fractures by partial patellectomy. The results of partial patellectomy as a treatment for displaced patellar fractures were assessed retrospectively with use of clinical, radiographic, and isokinetic strength-testing criteria. Forty patients who had been followed for an average of 8.4 years were studied. In the extremity that had been operated on, the mean active range of motion was 94 per cent, the circumference of the thigh was 100 per cent, and the strength of the quadriceps was 85 per cent of these measurements in the contralateral extremity. The over-all result was rated as excellent in twenty patients, good in eleven, fair in six, and poor in three. There was a significant statistical correlation between the type of fracture and the outcome. The results of this study indicate that partial patellectomy can be an effective treatment for selected patellar fractures. ",0
"Overnight admission of outpatient strabismus patients. The trend to outpatient strabismus surgery prompted us to determine the frequency of, and the reasons for, postoperative overnight hospital admission following such surgery. In one year, 303 outpatient strabotomies were performed at the Jules Stein Eye Institute on patients over 15 months old. Twenty-four (7.9%) were admitted overnight postoperatively. Compared with controls, those admitted were older (37 vs 20.5 years), and had a longer duration of anesthesia (145 vs 116 minutes) and surgery (104 vs 75 minutes) (P less than .01 for each). The time that surgery commenced and the use of perioperative medications were not significant factors. The most frequent reasons for overnight admission were nausea (38%) despite prophylaxis and the use of bilateral patches (16%). To minimize postoperative admissions, better strategies should be developed to decrease the frequency of significant postoperative nausea, the duration of surgery and anesthesia, and, if possible, the use of bilateral patches.

"Therapy of persistent human papillomavirus disease with two different interferon species. Consensus interferon and interferon alfa-2a were used to treat patients with persistent human papillomavirus disease. Thirty-one patients were treated with either consensus interferon or a placebo (25 received active drug and 6 received placebo), and 24 patients were treated with interferon alfa-2a. Of the 25 patients who received consensus interferon, 19 (76%) showed either complete or partial clearing of condyloma 10 and 16 weeks after initiation of therapy; in 22 of the 24 patients (91%) who received interferon alfa-2a, clearing was demonstrated after a similar time period. Thirty of 34 patients who had no response or a partial response requested additional therapy, and 20 of these patients treated with adjunctive therapy had a complete response. The results of this study support the efficacy of both interferons in the treatment of overt condyloma acuminatum and suggest that interferon enhances subsequent adjunctive therapy. ",0
"Dissociation between pain and autonomic disturbances in cluster headache. The relationship between pain and autonomic disturbances in cluster headache was studied in 54 patients whose attack always recurred on the same side, and in 7 others whose attack had affected either side on different occasions. In one of these seven patients, facial flushing and ocular sympathetic deficit was observed on the original side of headaches. In most patients, the orbital region was warmer on the painful side but in three cases this region was cooler during and between attacks. Lacrimation and rhinorrhoea were more common in severe attacks, and the temperature difference between the orbits increased with increasing severity of pain. These findings support the view that certain autonomic disturbances in cluster headache are provoked by pain. Residual autonomic dysfunction could influence autonomic activity during cluster headache. If so, residual dysfunction on the pain-free side could explain the dissociation between autonomic disturbances and pain observed in a few cases. ",0
"Reduction of the membrane fluidity of human breast cancer cells by tamoxifen and 17 beta-estradiol. The intracellular steady-state levels of methotrexate were previously shown to be reduced in estrogen receptor (ER)-negative human breast cancer MDA-MB-436 cells and ER-positive human breast cancer MCF7 cells following treatment with pharmacologically relevant concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol (E2). We now report that both E2 and tamoxifen (TMX) significantly decreased the fluidity of MCF7 and MDA-MB-436 cellular membranes. With E2 or TMX at concentrations greater than 1 microM, perturbations in membrane fluidity were accompanied by apparently non-ER-mediated cytotoxicity. Alterations in membrane structure may have contributed to the cytotoxicity of high-dose endocrine therapy and to the ability of E2 to inhibit methotrexate transport and cytotoxicity in some human breast cancer cells.

"Application of coronary angioplasty to the septal perforator arteries. Significant coronary artery disease affecting the septal perforator arteries can cause anginal pain, rhythm disturbances, or septal infarction. However, since these vessels are usually inaccessible to coronary bypass surgery, there is a tendency among angiographers and angioplasters to overlook lesions of the septal perforator arteries. Our experience suggests that if medical treatment is not sufficient to treat clinical manifestations resulting from septal perforator disease, then coronary angioplasty can be considered a therapeutic alternative for revascularization. We herein present 11 patients who underwent coronary angioplasty of a major septal artery and discuss angiographic and technical aspects of the procedure. ",0
"Biotype as determinant of natural immunising effect of cholera. To test the hypothesis that clinical Vibrio cholerae O1 infections protect against recurrent cholera, treated cholera episodes in a rural Bangladesh population of 188,153 people who were followed between 1985 and 1988 were analysed. Of the 2214 people with initial episodes of cholera, 7 had a second episode. The incidence of cholera was 61% lower in subjects who had had an earlier episode than in those without such an episode. Whereas initial episodes of classical cholera were associated with complete protection against subsequent cholera, initial episodes of El Tor cholera were associated with negligible protection. ",0
"Adventitial red blood cells produce intimal platelet accumulation in cerebral arteries of cats following subarachnoid hemorrhage. After dividing 21 cats into three equal groups, we exposed their right middle cerebral arteries transorbitally and adventitially irrigated them with 2 ml washed red blood cells, blood plasma, or saline. To determine arterial intimal platelet accumulation in each cat, we injected [111In]oxine-labeled platelets intravenously immediately before injecting the various experimental solutions. Animals were sacrificed 2 or 4 hours following the injection of labeled platelets. Irrigation with washed red blood cells produced a significantly greater intraluminal accumulation of platelets than irrigation with saline (p less than 0.05). Plasma tended to have less of an effect on platelet accumulation than washed red blood cells, but this difference was not significant. These data suggest that the adventitial blood fraction responsible for intimal platelet accumulation in cerebral arteries following subarachnoid hemorrhage may be derived mainly from the red blood cell fraction.

"Treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma with a combination of low-dose interferon alfa-2b and retinoids. In a pilot study the therapeutic effect and side effect profile of low-dose interferon alfa-2b in combination with a retinoid for the treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma were evaluated. Seven patients (four women, three men) with histologically confirmed cutaneous T cell lymphoma were included. Four patients had received therapy previously. The treatment schedule consisted of 2 million U of interferon alfa-2b administered subcutaneously three times per week and oral 13-cis-retinoic acid, 1 mg/kg/day, with subsequent dose reduction in case of response. The combination therapy produced two complete and two partial remissions. Responses were maintained by continuous therapy for up to 15 months even after dose reduction of both agents by 50%. Side effects were negligible and did not result in discontinuation of treatment in any patient. ",0
"Cervical spine stabilization. A three-dimensional, biomechanical evaluation of rotational stability, strength, and failure mechanisms. The three-dimensional rotational biomechanical properties of several different types of posterior stabilizing procedures are reported. A severe ligamentous and bony injury was simulated with three vertebral body human cervical spine segments. Good stabilization was noted for all of the repairs in flexion loading. Without polymethylmethacrylate supplementation, none of the repairs was stable in extension. All of the repairs provided reasonable stabilization for lateral bending except for the posterior wiring without methacrylate, and all but the posterior wiring and facet fusion provided reasonable stabilization against axial rotation loading. The supplementation of all of these repairs with polymethylmethacrylate added considerably to the stability of all the constraints. These findings may be useful in clinical decision-making for determining the kind of repairs and postoperative brace protection to use. ",0
"Response of the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome to treatment of associated small-cell lung carcinoma. We evaluated the outcome in 16 patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) associated with histologically verified small-cell carcinoma (SCC). Thirteen patients received specific tumor therapy (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or resection) and most also received pharmacologic and immunologic treatment for LEMS. Seven of 11 patients surviving for more than 2 months after tumor therapy showed substantial neurologic improvement (1 patient being in complete remission at 7 years); in 3 of 11 improvement was transient. An EMG index of disease severity (compound muscle action potential amplitude in abductor digiti minimi) was significantly increased at final follow-up (p less than 0.01; n = 11). A pretreatment amplitude greater than 3.0 mV was a good prognostic sign. We conclude that a combined treatment approach in SCC-LEMS usually results in neurologic improvement. ",0
"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease--more than a renal disease. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common genetic disease, affecting a half million Americans. The clinical phenotype can result from at least two different gene defects. One gene that can cause ADPKD has been located on the short arm of chromosome 16. This discovery has made possible new methods for diagnosing the disorder in gene carriers prior to the development of renal cysts. Although renal cysts are clearly an important manifestation of the gene defect, other systemic manifestations are both common and clinically important. Cardiac valvular lesions, intracranial aneurysms, hepatic cysts, and diverticula are included in the array of systemic manifestations. Moreover, renal cysts are only one of a myriad of renal manifestations. Although ADPKD was long considered an adult cystic disease, it is also a common cause of childhood cystic disease and must be considered in the differential diagnosis in that setting. ",0
"True hermaphrodite with bilateral ovotestes, bilateral gonadoblastomas and dysgerminomas, 46,XX/46,XY karyotype, and a successful pregnancy. The first case (to the authors' knowledge) is reported of a true hermaphrodite with bilateral ovotestes, bilateral gonadoblastomas and dysgerminomas, a 46, XX/46,XY karyotype, and a successful pregnancy. The true hermaphroditism was diagnosed during infancy. The patient was subsequently found to have a gonadoblastoma and a microscopic dysgerminoma in the gonad diagnosed as an ovotestis and excised during infancy. The successful pregnancy occurred when the patient was 29 years old. A year later a large gonadal tumor affecting the remaining gonad was excised. The gonad was found to be an ovotestis, and the tumor was a dysgerminoma arising from a gonadoblastoma. This case further emphasizes the malignant potential of the Y chromosome in patients with abnormal gonads. ",0
"What to do when an x-ray film suggests lung cancer. The chest film is one of the most common methods of detecting lung cancer, which often appears as solitary nodules or hilar masses. Once the diagnosis is established, the most effective treatment can be determined and staging of the tumor can be done. Surgical resection is the only cure for non-small-cell carcinoma, although radiotherapy and chemotherapy may shrink some tumors. Because 90% of all cases are caused by smoking, a preventive approach to the disease is crucial. Screening of high-risk patients (ie, smokers with airflow obstruction) using chest films and sputum cytology may aid this approach. ",0
"Epstein-Barr virus small nuclear RNAs are not expressed in permissively infected cells in AIDS-associated leukoplakia. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA structure and gene expression were analyzed in tissue specimens from oral hairy leukoplakia (HLP), a mucocutaneous lesion that develops in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The structure of the terminal restriction enzyme fragments of EBV revealed that HLP is a permissive infection without a predominant, detectable population of EBV episomal DNA. In RNA preparations from this uniquely permissive infection, EBV replicative mRNAs could be identified by Northern analysis; however, the virally encoded small nuclear RNAs, the EBERs, were not detected in most HLP RNA preparations. In situ hybridization detected EBER expression in very rare cells. These data indicate that unlike other viral small nuclear RNAs, the EBERs are not expressed during viral replication and must participate in the complex maintenance of latent EBV infection. ",0
"Attributes and survival patterns of multiple primary cutaneous malignant melanoma. From a series of 1495 patients with primary cutaneous malignant melanoma (PCMM), 26 patients (1.73%) had multiple primary cutaneous malignant melanoma (MPCMM). This report describes the attributes and survival patterns in this small, but important, subgroup of patients with PCMM. Of 26 patients, 23 had two primaries, two had three primaries, and one had six primaries. Five patients had synchronous and 21 patients had metachronous MPCMM. The median interval between the occurrence of the first and subsequent PCMM in these patients was 1.93 years. The estimated 5-year survival rate from the first melanoma was 83.5%; that from the last melanoma was 53.1%. In summary, MPCMM is a distinct biologic phenomenon. A second or subsequent malignant melanoma should be treated like a primary melanoma. ",0
"Synchronous positive and negative myoclonus due to pontine hemorrhage. We report a case of synchronous positive and negative myoclonus following pontine hemorrhage. Constant synchronous jerking of the eyes, tongue, face, mandible, larynx, pharynx, and diaphragms persisted during sleep. Jerking of limb muscles occurred during volitional activities, but not at rest. Inability to sustain glottic adduction during phonation contributed to severe dysarthria. Electromyography (EMG) revealed positive myoclonus of the branchial musculature with synchronous negative myoclonus in a generalized distribution. Treatment with trazodone reduced the ocular myoclonus but worsened the dysphagia. We suggest that a single neural rhythm generator may produce both positive and negative myoclonus. ",0
"Elevation of skeletal muscle isoform of serum creatine kinase in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia. Serum creatine kinase (CK) is an important adjunct in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction or in monitoring for the side-effects of drugs. We report elevation of CK in patients with untreated heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) with no evidence of myocardial infarction. Of a group of 30 patients, 60% had elevated CK values on one occasion. In 40% of patients elevated CK activity was observed on most occasions. This was not related to exercise or previous lipid-lowering therapy. These observations are of importance in view of the potential for misdiagnosis of myocardial infarction or premature withdrawal of lipid-lowering therapy. ",0
"Immunohistochemical demonstration of keratin in ameloblastoma as an indication of tumor differentiation. Keratin expression was studied immunohistochemically in 27 ameloblastomas using polyclonal antibody against wide-spectrum keratins (TTL) and monoclonal antibodies against lower- and higher-molecular-weight keratins (PKK1 and KL1), respectively, to clarify the tumor differentiation. Reactions with TTL and KL1 antibodies were generally positive in the stellate cells of the follicular or acanthomatous ameloblastomas. Cell nests of the basal cell type were positive for PKK1. On the other hand, the reactions with TTL or KL1 in the plexiform type were generally weak or absent. From these facts, it was concluded that the follicular, as well as acanthomatous, ameloblastoma is liable to undergo squamous differentiation, whereas the plexiform ameloblastoma remains in primitive stage of tumor differentiation.

"Supported employment: an alternative model for vocational rehabilitation of persons with severe neurologic, psychiatric, or physical disability. Participation in paid work in competitive industry through placement in supported employment is compared and analyzed for 278 severely disabled persons. Differential outcomes are described for persons with chronic mental illness, cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injury, and dual diagnosis of chronic mental illness and mental retardation. Results indicated that supported employment appears to be an effective means of assisting these historically unemployable individuals to acquire and retain work. Cross-disability group differences were found in areas such as hourly wages, type of employment, services provided by employment specialists, and job retention. The results represent a baseline from which to evaluate future efforts at competitive work placement for persons with severe disabilities, using the supported-employment model. ",0
"Triiodothyronine and brain excitability. We investigated mechanisms involved in thyroid hormone action on brain excitability. The effect of acute exposure of triiodothyronine (T3) to rat hippocampal slices in vitro was studied. No significant changes could be detected in prevolley, field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) and population spike amplitude, while there was a minor, nonsignificant trend toward shortening of the population spike latency time. T3 had no effect on penicillin-induced epileptiform activity. There was, however, an active accumulation of radioactively labeled T3 in the slices. A rat cervaux-isole preparation was used to determine focal seizure thresholds in the visual cortex, and no acute (2-4 h) effects were demonstrated. No significant acute effects of T3 on brain excitability in the hippocampus and visual cortex was observed, despite an active accumulation of T3. Thus, the effect of T3 on brain excitability most likely is due to delayed effects. ",0
"Mucocele of the cystic duct remnant in eight liver transplant recipients: findings at cholangiography, CT, and US. The case histories and radiologic studies of eight liver transplant recipients who developed a mucocele of the allograft cystic duct remnant were retrospectively evaluated. All patients had clinical and/or laboratory evidence of biliary obstruction or cholangitis from 2 weeks to 3.3 years following transplantation. Cholangiographic, ultrasound (US), and computed tomography (CT) images were available for review in eight, five, and four patients, respectively. Cholangiograms demonstrated an extrinsic mass compressing the common hepatic duct in seven of eight patients. US and CT showed fairly well- to well-defined round fluid collections adjacent to the common hepatic duct in three and two patients, respectively. The findings of this study suggest that the detection at cholangiography of an extrinsic mass compressing the common hepatic duct appears to be specific for a mucocele of the allograft cystic duct remnant. CT and US images may offer confirmatory evidence. ",0
"Ascites revealing peritoneal and hepatic extramedullary hematopoiesis with peliosis in agnogenic myeloid metaplasia: case report and review of the literature. A 61-year-old man presented with ascites in the course of agnogenic myeloid metaplasia (AMM). Ascitic fluid was exudative and contained mature and immature leukocytes, erythroid cells, and megakaryocytes as observed on a bone marrow smear. Peritoneal biopsy showed myeloid metaplasia, and liver biopsy revealed intrasinusoidal myeloid metaplasia and peliosis. Ascites cleared after abdominal radiotherapy but treatment resulted in transient aplasia. Subsequently, portal hypertension was demonstrated by hepatic transjugular catheterization. Complications of splenomegaly led to splenectomy and splenorenal shunt followed by fatal acute hepatitis and septic shock. A review of the literature and an analysis of mechanisms of ascites occurring in AMM, especially peritoneal implants of myeloid tissue and occurrence of peliosis in myeloproliferative disorders, are presented.

"Closed heart cryoablation of the His bundle using an anterior septal approach. His bundle cryosurgical ablation using a closed heart anterior septal approach was used in 6 patients. There were 3 men and 3 women, aged 24 to 73 years. Three patients had atrial fibrillation and 2 patients had atrial flutter (2 with combined episodes of atrial tachycardia). One patient had atrial tachycardia. Five patients had no structural heart disease and 1 patient had left ventricular dilatation (ejection fraction, 0.35). All patients undergoing His bundle cryosurgical ablation had permanent heart block without intraoperative complications (mean follow-up, 25 months). Closed heart anteroseptal cryoablation of the His bundle is effective and is an alternative to attempted catheter ablation. ",0
"Dysgeusia, gustatory sweating, and crocodile tears syndrome induced by a cerebellopontine angle meningioma. Facial nerve involvement in cerebellopontine angle tumors, both during their development and after excision, may be expressed in irreversible dysfunction of the parasympathetic pathways. The exact location of the lesion along the efferent nerve fibers can be established through evaluation of the functional level of those organs supplied by the cholinergic motor secretory components. This report deals with a female patient in whom peripheral facial palsy developed shortly after removal of a right cerebellopontine angle meningioma. She had slight facial asymmetry and deafness in the right ear and complained of prandial flush and sweating of the right malar area. Occult ipsilateral hyposalivation and hypolacrimation were diagnosed. In patients with seventh and ninth cranial nerve pathoses, evaluation of the end organs that are supplied by their associated autonomous nerve fibers is mandatory to prevent late ocular and oral sequelae.

"Esophageal involvement in pemphigus vulgaris: a clinical, histologic, and immunopathologic study. Eleven newly diagnosed patients and one patient with pemphigus vulgaris who relapsed underwent endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Three patients had blisters or erosions and two had longitudinal lines of erythema in the esophageal mucosa. In four patients histopathologic examination showed findings of pemphigus vulgaris but direct immunofluorescence was positive in all patients. This study demonstrates that the immunopathologic disturbance in pemphigus vulgaris involves the entire length of the esophagus, although only some patients have clinical or histologic involvement. To the best of our knowledge this is the first histopathologic and direct immunofluorescence study of esophageal involvement in patients with untreated pemphigus vulgaris. ",0
"Amyloidosis associated bleeding diatheses in the surgical patient. The coagulopathies associated with amyloidosis have not been widely appreciated. We encountered a patient with amyloidosis and mildly abnormal coagulation studies who presented for an emergency laparotomy for acute bowel obstruction. Upon gentle manipulation of the bowel, an unexpected bleeding diathesis was manifested by the formation of several large haematomas resulting in a large amount of blood loss (approximately 800 ml). Numerous defects of platelet function and coagulation have been associated with amyloidosis, including abnormal platelet aggregation, increased vascular fragility, factor IX and X deficiencies, decreased levels of alpha-2-plasmin inhibitor, and increased levels of plasminogen. Intraoperative therapy for our patient included the rapid administration of four units of fresh frozen plasma and ten units of platelet concentrate. A review of the pathology and therapeutic modalities for this potentially life-threatening complication is presented. ",0
"Portal vein resection with a new antithrombogenic catheter. Curative resection of pancreatic and hepatobiliary tumors is rarely possible because of local invasion, especially into the portal vein. We developed a new antithrombogenic catheter using a heparinized hydrophilic polymer to allow portal vein bypass during resection of tumors invading the portal vein. Pancreatectomy or hepatectomy accompanied by portal vein resection was performed for pancreatic or hepatobiliary cancer, with an intraoperative shunt from the superior mesenteric vein to the femoral vein or from the superior mesenteric vein to the intrahepatic portal vein through the umbilical vein or the hepatic hilar portal vein. Use of the shunt prevented stasis in the superior mesenteric vein and hepatic ischemia even during prolonged occlusion of the portal vein, and portal vein resection was performed in 81 patients with hepatobiliary and pancreatic disease with greater safety and ease.

"Refractory hypoglycemia secondary to topical salicylate intoxication. We describe a case of severe refractory hypoglycemia secondary to topical salicylate intoxication. A 72-year-old man with psoriasis and end-stage renal disease was treated with a topical cream containing 10% salicylic acid. The patient presented with encephalopathy and subsequently developed hypoglycemia refractory to infusions of large amounts of glucose. A serum salicylate concentration was elevated at 3.2 mmol/L. Emergent hemodialysis was accompanied by rapid lowering of serum salicylate concentration and resolution of refractory hypoglycemia. Salicylate is well absorbed across normal and diseased skin. Salicylate markedly impairs gluconeogenesis and increases glucose utilization, resulting in hypoglycemia. To our knowledge, this is the first article on hypoglycemia due to the application of topical salicylate. ",0
"Gastrointestinal disease and oral contraception. Oral contraceptive steroids play a major role in modern family planning. With the present tendency to decrease the doses of both estrogens and progestogens, any factor that reduces the bioavailability of the lower-dose preparations may have an impact on contraceptive protection. Although ethinyl estradiol, the most commonly used oral estrogen, is liable to an enterohepatic circulation as unchanged drug, the commonly used progestogens are not. At present, no convincing evidence exists in the human subject that disruption of the enterohepatic circulation by antibiotics or antacids does reduce contraceptive efficacy of the pill. Oral contraceptive steroids are mainly absorbed from the small bowel, and contraceptive efficacy depends on its absorptive capacity. Enhanced passage of gastrointestinal contents or impaired absorption may thus contribute to contraceptive failures in patients who have chronic inflammatory disease, diarrhea, ileostomy, or jejunoileal bypass.

"Desensitization in the management of vancomycin hypersensitivity. Vancomycin is the preferred antimicrobial agent in the treatment of methicillin-resistant staphylococcal infections. One of the well-known hypersensitivity reactions to this agent is the ""red-man syndrome,"" which is believed to involve drug-induced histamine release in certain individuals. Although rate and/or dose reductions may be effective in some cases, some hypersensitivity reactions necessitate the discontinuation of vancomycin. In this article one patient is described who developed vancomycin-associated reactions consistent with the red-man syndrome despite having tolerated vancomycin administration previously. This case was managed by sequential increments in vancomycin administration over several days that allowed for therapeutic doses of the drug to be administered. Prior to desensitization, vancomycin administration at a lowered rate and dose was unsuccessfully attempted, despite the presence of combination antihistamine therapy. A loss of skin prick test reactivity to vancomycin was demonstrated after successful desensitization. This desensitization method may be useful in managing certain refractory cases of vancomycin hypersensitivity. ",0
"Admissions to the intensive care unit after complications of anaesthetic techniques over 10 years. 2. The second 5 years Compared with the first 5 years there was a 19% increase in general anaesthetics, a 171% increase in local and (or) sedation techniques and a 9% increase in obstetric epidurals with no increase in anaesthetic staffing. In this second 5-year period, 46 patients were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit as a result of a complication of an anaesthetic technique. These patients represented 1 in 2371 anaesthetic techniques carried out in the District compared with the previous 5 years where the incidence was 1 in 1543. Seven patients died (15.2%). The complication was considered to be wholly or partially avoidable in 14 instances (30.4%). Four of these subjects died. ",0
"The epithelial changes associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva: a review of the clinical, histological and viral findings in 78 women. Seventy-eight excised specimens of squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva were reviewed retrospectively for the presence of lichen sclerosus or vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) at sites proximal to the tumour or more distant. Lichen sclerosus was evident in 61% and VIN alone in 31%. VIN III (differentiated) was associated with over 50% of the specimens with lichen sclerosus. HPV 16 was found in six of the 11 VIN lesions, investigated but in none of the six with lichen sclerosus. ",0
"Total parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation in hyperplasia of the parathyroid gland. Hyperparathyroidism caused by multiple-gland hyperplasia has traditionally been treated by subtotal parathyroidectomy. Excellent results have been reported by some, particularly in primary hyperparathyroidism, but other have reported a significant incidence of recurrent hyperparathyroidism. Since 1979, we have chosen to avoid the possibility of remedial exploration of the neck and its attendant risks by treating all patients with primary and secondary hyperplasia with total parathyroidectomy and heterotopic autotransplantation. A total of 20 patients were studied. There were no failures of grafts and no operative complications. We conclude that this procedure is a reliable and safe alternative in the treatment of primary or secondary hyperplasia of the parathyroid gland. ",0
"Absence of acetylcholine-induced current in epithelial cells from thymus glands and thymomas of myasthenia gravis patients. We investigated the activity of ion channels in epithelial cells from human thymus glands and thymomas kept in short-term cell culture by clamping the membrane potential of the cells at -85 mV and determining the membrane current flowing on application of acetylcholine, glycine, or gamma-aminobutyric acid. In concentrations of up to 10(-3) M, none of the neurotransmitters induced any detectable current. This suggests (1) that there are no acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) or other products of the AChR gene family having ion-channel properties in the membranes of these epithelial cells, and (2) that the alpha-bungarotoxin-binding protein of thymus and thymoma has no AChR-like ion-channel property. These results support the hypothesis that the cross-reacting structures that elicit the anti-AChR autoimmune response in thymoma-associated myasthenia gravis are antigens having only limited homology with the AChR. Myasthenia gravis not associated with thymoma might have a different pathogenesis. ",0
"The technicon H6000 analyzer discriminates chronic lymphocytic leukemia from other B-cell leukemias through automatic assessment of large unstained cells. The separation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia of B-cell origin from other chronic B-cell leukemias is subjective, being largely based on the morphologic features of the lymphoid cells in the peripheral blood. The percentage of large unstained cells determined with a Technicon H6000 analyzer (an automated blood cell differential analyzer, Technicon Instruments Corp, Tarrytown, NY) was used as a cell volume variable in an investigation of 70 cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia of B-cell origin and of other chronic B-cell leukemias. The significant degree of correlation between the percentage of large unstained cells and morphoimmunophenotypic diagnosis, although obtained for a relatively small number of cases, suggests that this method of cell volume analysis can be used to improve diagnostic reproducibility in chronic B-cell leukemia.

"Attachment of bacteria to tonsillar epithelium during acute tonsillitis. Epithelial cells were scraped from the tonsillar surfaces of 15 patients with current acute tonsillitis (AT) and of 15 individually matched healthy persons. The cellular mixture was stained with acridine orange and bacteria seen to be attached to the epithelial cells under the fluorescent microscope were calculated. Conventional bacterial culturing was also performed simultaneously. Significantly more bacteria were attached to epithelial cells from the AT group than from the controls (greater than 10 attached bacteria per cell p = 0.0103, greater than 50 attached bacteria per cell p = 0.0212). In vivo determination of bacteria attached to epithelial cells offers prospects of gaining a better understanding of the aetiopathogenesis of acute tonsillitis. ",0
"Recovery from disturbed colonic transit time after alcohol withdrawal. The effects of alcohol withdrawal on total and segmental transit time were evaluated in 20 chronic alcoholic subjects. After withdrawal, colorectal transit time significantly increased from 24.9 +/- 3.6 to 33.3 +/- 4.5 hours mean +/- SE (P less than 0.01). This was the result of an exclusive increase in rectosigmoid transit time from 2.8 +/- 0.7 to 9.8 +/- 2.1 hours (P less than 0.001). No variations were found in right or left colon transit time. Distal colonic motility is thus a crucial factor in the genesis of diarrhea in chronic alcoholic subjects. ",0
"Role of tolerance in cloxacillin treatment of experimental Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis. The role of Staphylococcus aureus tolerance was investigated in endocarditis in rats. The efficacies of cloxacillin, gentamicin, and a combination of the two were compared for animals infected with a tolerant strain, its kill-sensitive variant, or a nonisogenic nontolerant strain of S. aureus. Cloxacillin was significantly less effective for treating the tolerant than for the nontolerant strains. The addition of gentamicin to cloxacillin reduced bacterial numbers in endocardial vegetations for the tolerant strain comparable to the reduction by cloxacillin alone for the nontolerant strains, but had no additional effect for the nontolerant strains. Isolates from animals infected with the tolerant or nontolerant strains during antibiotic treatment remained tolerant or nontolerant. These results show that the in vitro phenomenon of tolerance is relevant in vivo. ",0
"Management of local and regional recurrence after mastectomy or breast-conserving treatment. Locoregional failures after primary treatment for breast cancer include a diverse group of lesions that represent different categories of failures with various prognoses. Although patients with chest wall recurrences and regional nodal failures after traditional radical surgery have a poor prognosis, many patients can still achieve a significant degree of palliation and even long-term survival or cure with carefully orchestrated multimodal treatment. In patients who have breast failures after breast-conservation surgery and radiation, long-term salvage and cure can be achieved for the majority with prompt detection and appropriate treatment, which, like treatment for primary breast cancer, includes a consideration not only of local control but also of the risk of subsequent systemic failure and its need for treatment.

"Doppler color-flow images from a stenosed arterial model: interpretation of flow patterns. The capability of the recently introduced Doppler color-flow mapping devices to accurately detect flow patterns in the region of an arterial stenosis was evaluated by use of an in vitro flow model. Pulsatile flow simulating that in a low-resistance vessel was induced through a straight acrylic tube, which alternatively contained axisymmetric stenoses of 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% diameter reduction. Doppler color-flow mapper images were taken in realtime along the tube midplane from 0 to 8 diameters downstream of each stenosis. Comparison of the Doppler color-flow mapping results with similarly recorded flow visualization (hydrogen bubble) images showed a close correspondence of key features of the flow, including detection of a high-velocity, centerline jet and near-wall separated flow zones. Distinctive flow patterns exist with each stenotic case, and these should be of considerable value in diagnosing clinical disease conditions. ",0
"Primary solid neoplasms of the greater omentum. Primary solid tumors of the greater omentum are rare, with only 42 reported cases. Malignant hemangiopericytomas constitute only three of these cases. The 40-year-old patient described in this report had abdominal pain, a palpable abdominal mass, early satiety, and weight loss. At laparotomy a large omental hemangiopericytoma was excised, and no other evidence of disease was grossly evident. Eighteen months after initial laparotomy, the patient had widespread progression of the tumor and, despite chemotherapy, died 2 months later. A review of reported cases shows that abdominal discomfort (56%) and mass (35%) are the most common clinical characteristics of a primary omental tumor. Weight loss, ascites, and peritoneal implants usually indicate malignancy. Rare long-term follow-up prevents definitive conclusions regarding therapy and prognosis. At present, surgical excision alone appears to be the treatment of choice, with no demonstrable benefit from either chemotherapy or radiation. ",0
"Prediction of cognitive change as a function of preoperative ability status among temporal lobectomy patients seen at 6-month follow-up. The relationship between preoperative ability levels and postoperative changes in cognitive function was examined among 23 left (LTL) and 19 right (RTL) temporal lobectomy patients using a battery of memory, language, and visuospatial tasks administered approximately 3 months before surgery and at 6 months follow-up. Higher preoperative performances on the memory and language measures were associated with larger decrements in postsurgical scores among the LTL patients. The RTL group showed no consistent relationship between preoperative ability levels and subsequent postsurgical cognitive changes. Based on the present data, we constructed base-rate tables for the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised indicating the likelihood of measurable gains or losses in memory as a function of presurgical ability level for patients undergoing LTL. While tentative, these data provide a useful and practical guide for counseling prospective epilepsy patients of the attendant cognitive risks of LTL. ",0
"Long-time survival of a patient with glioblastoma and Turcot's syndrome. Case report. A rare case of Turcot's syndrome is reported in a long-time survivor of glioblastoma multiforme. The patient was treated for his tumor in 1976 with macroscopically complete surgical resection and radiotherapy consisting of 60 Gy to the tumor bed and 40 Gy to the whole brain. Five years later, in 1981, he developed adenocarcinoma of the colon Dukes Stage B which was successfully treated at another hospital by surgery alone. In 1990, he presented with multiple colon polyps and adenocarcinoma Dukes Stage A. For more than 15 years, the patient has been afflicted with cystic and conglobate acne. Possible mechanisms and treatment with 13-cis retinoic acid are discussed. ",0
"Changes in surgical treatments: the example of hysterectomy versus conization for cervical carcinoma in situ. From 1969 through 1985, 4584 women in the state of New Mexico were diagnosed with carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Of these women, 65.5% underwent hysterectomy while 31.1% had a conservative therapy (primarily conization). Over the 17-year period, there was a steady increase in the percentage of women receiving conservative therapies, from 11.8% in 1969 to 50.3% in 1985. Younger women, unmarried women and American Indian women were more likely to receive conservative therapy. This marked shift in therapeutic approach occurred during a time of apparent controversy as to the optimal treatment for cervical carcinoma in situ, and illustrates a rapid change in surgical practice in the absence of any controlled trials comparing the two major treatment modalities.

Gastroduodenal mucosa in uraemia: endoscopic and histological correlation and prevalence of helicobacter-like organisms. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of endoscopic and histological gastroduodenitis as well as helicobacter-like organisms in patients with end stage renal failure undergoing maintenance dialysis treatment. A total of 322 out of 422 patients in our dialysis programme underwent endoscopy and gastroduodenal biopsy specimens were taken from 260. Endoscopic gastroduodenitis occurred in 158 (49%). Histological gastritis occurred in the gastric body or antrum in 134 patients (52%) and duodenitis in 52 (21%). There was no correlation between endoscopic and histological gastritis in contrast to a significant correlation for duodenitis. Helicobacter-like organisms occurred in the body or antrum in 81 (31%). Their presence was associated with gastritis--in particular acute and acute on chronic gastritis rather than chronic gastritis. Patients with gastritis were significantly older than those without (p less than 0.001) and had lower basal and peak acid outputs. ,0
"Arterial oxygen desaturation during gastrointestinal endoscopy This prospective study evaluated the incidence and severity of arterial oxygen desaturation during gastrointestinal endoscopy. Following pulmonary function testing, 115 male patients underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), colonoscopy, or colonoscopy followed by EGD, with continuous recording of arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2). Most patients (80/115, 70%) showed arterial oxygen desaturation (greater than 4% decrease from baseline SaO2); severe arterial oxygen desaturation (SaO2 less than or equal to 85%) reflecting hypoxemia (PaO2 less than or equal to 50 mm Hg) was noted in one-third of patients overall (37/115, 32%). Severe arterial oxygen desaturation occurred in 9/62 EGD patients (15%), 23/46 colonoscopy patients (50%), and 4/7 patients having colonoscopy followed by EGD (57%). Arterial oxygen desaturation occurs frequently during gastrointestinal endoscopy and is often severe. These data support the concept that continuous monitoring of SaO2 should be standard procedure during all gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures. ",0
"The development of infratentorial atrophy in patients with idiopathic cerebellar ataxia of late onset: a CT study. The development of infratentorial atrophy in six patients suffering from idiopathic cerebellar ataxia of late onset was studied by a retrospective evaluation of consecutive computed tomography (CT) scans. Four patients had evidence of olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA) both on clinical testing and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In these four patients, atrophy of the cerebellum and brain stem became visible at the same time and progressed in a roughly parallel manner, whereas in the remaining two the brain stem was left intact. In all patients with OPCA, definite brain-stem atrophy was visible earlier than the appearance of non-cerebellar clinical symptoms. The present data suggest that CT investigations at regular intervals may be of prognostic value in cerebellar ataxias. ",0
"Imaging the gallbladder: a historical perspective. After Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen's discovery of the X-ray in 1895, it was initially thought that gallstones could not be visualized. Surgeons relied solely on the clinical examination to detect biliary disease. Today, no evaluation of the gallbladder would be complete without the performance of an imaging study. Radiology has gone through several eras in the imaging of gallstones. The plain film era, 1895-1924, was characterized by techniques that improved soft-tissue detail, allowing better detection of radiopaque stones. The contrast media era, 1924-1960, was initiated by the invention of IV cholecystography. In 1925, oral cholecystography was developed. During the era of expanding technology, 1960-1979, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, scintigraphy, and sonography came into use. The therapeutic era began in the 1980s. ",0
"Nosocomial infections due to Xanthomonas maltophilia (Pseudomonas maltophilia) in patients with cancer. From December 1985 to May 1986, Xanthomonas maltophilia (formerly known as Pseudomonas maltophilia) was isolated at an increased rate at our institution; 52 isolates of X. maltophilia were obtained in cultures of clinical specimens from 38 patients during that time. The records of 35 of these patients form the basis of this study. Twelve (71%) of the 17 infected and nine (50%) of the 18 colonized patients had received or were receiving antimicrobial therapy. Eleven of 17 patients (three of seven with septicemia, three of five with pneumonia, three with urinary tract infection, and two with wound infection) responded to antimicrobial therapy. Microbiologic studies of the potential environmental sources revealed growth of X. maltophilia in two water faucets and in one water sample from the medical intensive care unit. X. maltophilia is emerging as an important nosocomial pathogen in immunocompromised patients, especially those receiving broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy. ",0
"Hypertension during pregnancy in insulin-dependent diabetic women. Insulin-dependent diabetic patients are at increased risk for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. This study was designed to study prospectively the rate of pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) in 175 insulin-dependent diabetic pregnancies (88 White classes B-C, 87 classes D-RT). Pregnancy-induced hypertension was defined as two or more occurrences after 20 weeks' gestation of a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 105 mmHg or greater or an increase of 20 mmHg or greater from the baseline MAP. The rate of PIH in the diabetic population was 15.4% and was significantly associated with nulliparity, poor glycemic control in the first and second trimesters, and advanced White class. Neonatal outcome was not significantly altered in the presence of PIH. We speculate that improved glycemic control throughout pregnancy might reduce the rate of this complication in diabetic patients. ",0
"Optimal escort for interhospital transport of pediatric emergencies. The charts of 130 seriously ill or injured children transported to tertiary level intensive care were examined to determine the incidence of secondary insults incurred, as a function of escort training. Of all insults incurred, approximately 8% occurred with specialized pediatric transport escorts who were accompanied by a tertiary care physician (Group III, n = 52); 20% with specialized pediatric transport escorts alone (Group II, n = 44); and 72% with escorts who had not received specialized pediatric transport training (Group I, n = 34). Based on our results, we recommend that all transport coordinators review the qualifications and experience of their transport team members and all potential escorts to assess their ability to provide optimal care for the children they transport, particularly during long journeys, transfer by air, and when serious illness or injury is involved.

"Relative effects of brain and non-brain injuries on neuropsychological and psychosocial outcome. Based on the 242 consecutive surviving head injury cases and 132 general trauma cases, this study examined the contribution of brain and non-brain injuries to cognitive and psychosocial outcome 1 month postinjury. The study also examined the relationships among various head injury severity indices. The head injury severity indices were all correlated but patients with Glasgow Coma Scale scores in the mild range had broadly ranging scores on the other head injury severity indices (Abbreviated Injury Scale and time to follow commands). Neuropsychological outcome was related to brain injury severity, but was not independently influenced by severity of other systems injuries. Psychosocial outcome related to both brain and non-brain injuries independently. When evaluating trauma outcome, it is important to consider the contributions of both brain and other system injuries.

"Intraoperative ultrasonography and the detection of liver metastases in patients with colorectal cancer. A total of 213 patients with carcinoma of the colon and rectum were examined to detect liver metastases. The study compared preoperative ultrasonography and inspection and palpation of the liver during surgery with intraoperative ultrasonography. Preoperative ultrasonography, inspection and palpation identified 238 metastases in 42 patients. Intraoperative ultrasonography detected 116 previously unrecognized metastatic tumours during 40 surgical procedures (P less than 0.01). High resolution intraoperative ultrasonography is safe and more accurate than preoperative imaging and surgical exploratory methods. The examination is simple to perform and success appears to be related to careful attention to detail. ",0
"Subscapular elastofibroma in a young pitcher. A case report. Subscapular elastofibromas and scapulothoracic bursitis can cause symptomatic masses in baseball pitchers. Both processes appear to represent reactive soft tissue responses to repetitive stress at the inferior border of the scapula. It is assumed that most masses in the subscapular area represent scapulothoracic bursitis rather than an elastofibroma. However, it is possible that some of the masses treated conservatively as scapulothoracic bursitis may be elastofibromas. A study is currently under way to evaluate the incidence of subscapular masses in college and professional pitchers in the United States. A follow-up report is anticipated when the study has been completed. The author requests information concerning any confirmed cases of elastofibroma in baseball pitchers. ",0
"Photodynamic therapy with chloroaluminum-sulfonated phthalocyanine. To study the vascular effects of a new photosensitizing agent independent of the influence of tumor growth, a cutaneous wound model was used. Six-week-old Harlan-Sprague-Dawley ""Fuzzy"" rats were surgically wounded in a standard fashion. The animals were then divided into three groups: the first group received chloroaluminum-sulfonated phthalocyanine only, the second group was treated with light only, and a third group was treated with both chloroaluminum-sulfonated phthalocyanine and light. Photodynamic therapy with chloroaluminum-sulfonated phthalocyanine had a direct effect on the neovasculature of a healing wound. The vasodilatation that was seen in the wound neovasculature that occurred 12 hours after the completion of chloroaluminum-sulfonated phthalocyanine-photodynamic therapy may have indicated a therapeutic ""window"" at which other therapies can be employed to improve clinical efficacy.

"Laparoscopic guided cholecystectomy. Cholecystectomy remains the most effective form of therapy for patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis. An alternative method of gallbladder removal, laparoscopic guided cholecystectomy, was attempted in 100 patients. Five patients required conversion of the laparoscopic procedure to an open laparotomy for the following reasons: discovery of a pancreatic malignancy in one patient, extensive adhesions in one, presence of an aberrant accessory right hepatic duct in one, common hepatic duct injury in one, and avulsion of the cystic duct in one. Both ductal injuries occurred during the early phase of the clinical program. In those patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 93 were discharged within 24 hours of surgery and 94 returned to normal activity within 1 week. Laparoscopic guided cholecystectomy appears to offer a number of advantages in patient care as well as a significant reduction in health care expenses for gallbladder disease. Appropriate training in laparoscopic surgery is necessary in order to avoid operative complications. ",0
"Sudden death caused by coronary artery aneurysms: a late complication of Kawasaki disease. The authors describe three cases (two blacks and one Latin American) of sudden death caused by late complications of Kawasaki disease (mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome). At autopsy each heart contained multiple coronary artery aneurysms with luminal stenosis caused by intimal hyperplasia and thrombi. Although virtually all fatal cases of Kawasaki disease occur within six months of the onset of symptoms, there have been other reported deaths up to 14 years after the acute illness. The coronary artery aneurysms of Kawasaki disease may persist and cause death years after the acute illness. ",0
"Differentiation of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Implantable devices capable of several modes of therapy will require differentiation of various ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Three methods of arrhythmia analysis, magnitude-squared coherence, ventricular rate, and irregularity of cycle length were performed for 45 episodes of induced ventricular tachyarrhythmia in 15 patients. Differentiation of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia from polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation was possible by mean magnitude-squared coherence, less possible by rate, and not possible by beat-to-beat irregularity. Faster monomorphic ventricular tachycardia overlapped with rates of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. Differentiation of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation was not possible by rate or irregularity. A progressive decrease in mean magnitude-squared coherence from monomorphic ventricular tachycardia to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia to ventricular fibrillation strengthens previous observations that coherence is a measure of rhythm ""organization."".

"Antenatal spontaneous perforation of the extrahepatic biliary tree. Spontaneous perforation of the biliary system is an unusual neonatal phenomenon that is rarely recognized at birth. To date, it has not been reported antenatally. A 16-year-old pregnant adolescent had an ultrasonogram at 25 weeks of pregnancy that revealed ascites in the fetus. After the infant was delivered at 32 weeks, a hepato-iminodiacetic acid scan showed a spontaneous rupture of the common bile duct. The infant was treated with external drainage of the biliary tree and recovered well. This case demonstrates that spontaneous perforations of the bile ducts can occur much earlier than the usually described 2 to 12 weeks after birth, can be diagnosed antenatally, and should be added to the list of causes of fetal ascites.

"Dystrophin analysis in Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy carriers: correlation with intracellular calcium and albumin. Immunocytochemical localization and immunoblot analysis of dystrophin in muscle fibers of 11 obligate and probable, and 7 possible carriers of Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy revealed an abnormal expression of the protein in 3 of them. Localization of calcium and albumin, as endogenous markers of extracellular fluid penetration, showed the presence of both molecules inside some fibers lacking dystrophin. Our morphological studies show that the initial stages leading to fiber necrosis in Duchenne muscular dystrophy are present in carriers with mosaicism. Comparison of dystrophin studies with restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and creatine kinase levels showed that neither immunocytochemical nor immunoblot techniques for dystrophin are sensitive enough to provide a basis for genetic counseling.

"Lateral deviation of the eyes on forced lid closure in patients with cerebral lesions. We examined 35 patients with unilateral cerebral lesions to determine the incidence of lateral deviation of the eyes under forcefully closed lids and the reliability of this sign in predicting the side of the lesion. Only patients with radiologically confirmed unilateral lesions were studied. Over 70% of patients had contralateral ocular deviation (Cogan's ""spasticity of conjugate gaze""), 20% had ipsilateral deviation, and less than 9% of the patients had no deviation. Lateral ocular deviation was as sensitive, but not as specific, as a unilateral Babinski plantar response in determining the side with the lesion. Contralateral deviation was more common with parietotemporal localization, suggesting that the phenomenon reflects an underlying disturbance of attentional mechanisms. ",0
"Small bile duct abnormalities in sarcoidosis. We report four patients with hepatic involvement of sarcoidosis manifested primarily by bile duct depletion. The patients developed fever, weight loss, anorexia, a markedly elevated alkaline phosphatase, and mildly abnormal serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography showed slight intrahepatic irregularities but were not diagnostic of sclerosing cholangitis. Liver biopsy showed predominantly bile duct depletion, ranging from an estimated 10-100% absence of bile ducts in portal areas, which correlated with the degree of fibrosis. The degree of bile duct depletion is useful as a histological marker in patients with sarcoid liver disease. Steroids improve symptoms, but do not inhibit the development of ""ductopenia."". ",0
"Extramammary Paget's disease of the bronchial epithelium. We report the first case, to our knowledge, of extramammary Paget's disease of the bronchial epithelium. The tumor displayed Paget's cells scattered within the bronchial epithelium in most of the lesion, but infiltrating into the bronchial submucosa and pulmonary parenchyma with microglandular and papillary patterns in some area. In addition to the histologic findings of coexistence with adenocarcinomatous components, in situ involvement into bronchial glands and ducts by Paget's cells was observed, suggesting that extramammary Paget's disease of the bronchial epithelium may be a variant of pulmonary adenocarcinoma, which is associated with bronchial glands.

"Wilson's disease: 35 years' experience. Thirty-seven Chinese patients fulfilling the criteria for Wilson's disease seen during a 35-year period were reviewed. Males and females were equally affected. Twenty-two patients were symptomatic and 15 asymptomatic; most of them presented before the third decade. Thirty-one per cent of the relatives screened showed evidence of disease, and parents were rarely affected (13 per cent). Half of the adult symptomatic females presented with primary amenorrhoea. Liver laboratory tests were abnormal in only 50 per cent of patients, with gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase being the most sensitive index. Renal disease was infrequent. Serum caeruloplasmin level was the single biochemical parameter of prognostic significance (p = 0.0001). Seventy per cent of the symptomatic patients showed an improvement after treatment with penicillamine. ",0
"Treatment of manifest and impending pathologic fractures of the femoral neck by cemented hemiarthroplasty. Thirty-four patients with manifest or impending pathologic fractures of the femoral neck were treated between 1971 and 1987. Breast carcinoma was the primary tumor in the majority of patients. All patients were treated with cemented hemiarthroplasty. Twenty-seven patients (79%) could walk at an average of nine days postoperatively. All patients experienced relief of pain. Two superficial wound dehiscences, one loosening of the prosthesis, and two prosthetic dislocations were encountered. Mean survival was 17.6 months overall (12 months for manifest fractures and 40 months for impending fractures). These results indicate that cemented hemiarthroplasty for pathologic fractures is a safe procedure resulting in long-lasting palliation without necessitating postoperative irradiation. The importance of tumor excochleation and the advantages of bone cement are emphasized. ",0
"Implementation of cancer prevention guidelines in clinical practice. Data from several sources, including consumer surveys, physician surveys, and medical record audits, indicate that consumers do not receive cancer screening tests as recommended by the National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society, and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. Performance rates are consistently below published standards for all tests except Pap tests. Major reasons physicians do not perform the recommended tests include physician forgetfulness, disagreement with recommendations, lack of time, and patient refusal. Physicians also tend to overestimate their own performance rates. Barriers to screening test performance can be categorized into patient factors, physician factors, test factors, and health care delivery system factors. Interventions, such as computerized reminder systems, physician audits with feedback, and patient education and reminders, can be effective in promoting performance of such screening. Interventions that target both physician and patient may be particularly effective. ",0
"Longitudinal study of diagnoses in children of women with unipolar and bipolar affective disorder. School-age children of unipolar depressed, bipolar, chronically medically ill, or normal women were diagnosed every 6 months for up to 3 years. Offspring of unipolar women had the highest rates of disorder at all evaluations, but children of bipolar and medically ill mothers also experienced significant rates of disorder. Observing diagnoses from both past lifetime and prospective follow-up assessments, it appeared that most children who had diagnoses had onsets in preadolescence and continued a chronic or intermittent course of disorder. Thus, risk to offspring of ill mothers is not transitory and indicates a pernicious course that commonly includes effective disorders alone or in combination with behavior and anxiety disorders. ",0
"Contracturing granulomatous myositis: a separate entity. Granulomatous muscle disease is most commonly seen in sarcoidosis, but may be seen in association with a wide variety of other disorders or in isolation. Patients with granulomatous myositis usually present with slowly progressive muscle pain and weakness affecting mainly proximal muscles. There are, however, a few reports of granulomatous muscle disease presenting with flexion contractures of the limbs. Two further patients with granulomatous muscle disease and flexion contractures of the limbs, but with no evidence of systemic granulomatous disease, is presented. It is suggested that such patients represent a separate clinical entity that is distinct from idiopathic granulomatous myositis presenting with muscle pain and weakness. The association of contracturing granulomatous myositis with a long-standing vasculitis in one patient suggests that the two conditions may be related. ",0
"Malignant glandular triton tumor. A case of left brachial plexus-related malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor showing neoplastic, glandular, and rhabdomyoblastic elements in a 39-year-old Chinese man is reported. The authors suggested that this tumor be termed a malignant glandular triton tumor in view of the presence of the adenocarcinomatous component. The patient had extensive local recurrence comprising mainly the Schwann spindle cells within a year after complete piecemeal removal and died 15 months later after the initial presentation. The natural behavior of this tumor, as in other reported cases of malignant triton tumor, is extremely aggressive, unlike malignant schwannoma or glandular malignant schwannoma. The histogenesis of this tumor is likely to be from primitive neural crest cells, Schwann's cell precursors, or metaplastic malignant Schwann's cells. ",0
"Clinicopathologic and flow cytometric DNA study of medullary thyroid carcinoma. Sixty-one patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma were investigated to establish relationships between the neoplasm's DNA content, other clinicopathologic factors, and patient survival (at least 5 years' follow-up). There were 26 (42.6%) familial and 35 (57.4%) sporadic carcinomas. Forty-two neoplasms (68.8%) were diploid and 19 (31.2%) were aneuploid by flow cytometric assessment. In univariate analysis, age, hereditary background, DNA content, calcitonin immunoreactivity, and type of surgery were strong predictors of clinical outcomes. In multivariate regression analysis, none of these factors was an independent prognosticator. Patients' gender, clinical stage, histologic subtype, and amyloid content of the tumor did not influence survival. ",0
"Complications of general anesthesia for Nd:YAG laser resection of endobronchial tumors. We studied the incidence and mechanisms of cardiovascular complications and postoperative respiratory insufficiency associated with GA and Nd:YAG laser endobronchial tumor resection. The records of 73 patients undergoing 87 procedures were reviewed. Preoperative status, anesthetic methods and perioperative complications were analyzed by multiple regression to determine predictors of outcome. Twenty-three percent of patients had greater than 90 percent mainstem bronchus obstruction. Longer serum elimination half-life of relaxant drug was significantly correlated with longer duration of mechanical ventilation after neuromuscular blockade reversal. Cardiovascular complications were noted in 24 procedures and often required therapeutic intervention. Variables predicting cardiovascular complications included longer duration of GA and increasing age. Perioperative respiratory and cardiovascular complications are common after GA for Nd: YAG laser resection. Short-acting neuromuscular relaxants, careful assessment prior to postoperative extubation, limiting duration of GA and cardiovascular monitoring are recommended when implementing GA for Nd: YAG laser resection of endobronchial tumors.

"Demonstration of the genuine iso-12p character of the standard marker chromosome of testicular germ cell tumors and identification of further chromosome 12 aberrations by competitive in situ hybridization. The recently developed competitive in situ hybridization (CISH) strategy was applied to the analysis of chromosome 12 aberrations in testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs). DNAs from two rodent-human somatic cell hybrids, containing either a normal chromosome 12 or the p arm of chromosome 12 as their unique human material, were used as probes. Our results demonstrate a genuine iso-12p character of the standard marker chromosome in TGCTs. Moreover, variant markers were identified representing translocation products that also involve chromosome 12. ",0
"The failure of serial pneumatic cuff venous occlusion plethysmography to predict patients at risk for pulmonary emboli after trauma. Over a three month period, attempts to perform serial Pneumatic Cuff Venous Occlusion Plethysmography (VP) were carried out in 51 severely injured patients felt to be at risk for Pulmonary Embolus (PE). Studies could not be performed in 25 of these patients due to the nature of their injuries. Of the remaining 26 patients, two showed evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Venography confirmed the diagnosis in only one of these patients. Serial VP failed to predict PE in all five patients in whom it was diagnosed. This article concludes that serial VP is not an effective predictor of PE in these patients. ",0
"Pathological changes in levator palpebrae superioris muscle treated with botulinum toxin in a case of carotico-cavernous fistula. We describe the case of a patient with carotico-cavernous fistula who had botulinum toxin A to induce a protective ptosis 4.5 days before death. The levator palpebrae superioris muscle from both sides and the superior rectus muscle from the injected side were obtained for examination. The preserved samples were stained with haematoxylin and eosin, Martius scarlet blue, Glees, S100, dehydrogenase, ATPase, and toluidine blue as well as being examined by electron microscopy. Inflammation and oedema were found that were probably due to the carotico-cavernous fistula. Axonal and some myelin sheath damage were also seen. ",0
"Surgical complications of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Surgical experience with 260 consecutive patients with chronic renal failure receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) at one medical center from 1980 to 1989 is reviewed. Patients received CAPD for a mean of 24.2 months (range: 3 days to 91 months). Catheter longevity consistently improved in all but 1 year from 1984 to 1989, as did exit-site and tunnel infections. Of 311 catheters inserted, 151 (49%) required removal, of which 111 (74%) were attributed to peritonitis. Cumulative patient survival was 80%, 60%, and 53% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. Diabetic patients had statistically significant lower survival rates. Additional complications including catheter leakage, catheter malposition, catheter obstruction, and abdominal wall hernias were negligible. Although CAPD is not free from serious complications, our data show remarkable improvement since 1980 in catheter longevity, hospital stay, and infection rates. ",0
"Botulinum A toxin for the treatment of adult-onset spasmodic torticollis. Thirty-five patients with adult-onset idiopathic torticollis were treated by local injections of botulinum A toxin into dystonic cervical muscles. Substantial improvement with respect to reduction and elimination of pain was found in 81 percent, improvement in posture deformity and involuntary spasms in 70 percent, increased range of motion of the neck in 78 percent, reduction in visible sternocleidomastoid hypertrophy in 86 percent, and improvement in tremor in 65 percent. The syndrome was divided into four subtypes based on pattern of dystonic muscle groups involved in the dystonia, head and shoulder posture, and sternocleidomastoid muscle hypertrophy. Injection strategy based on this subdivision is described. ",0
"Carcinoma of the cervix: value of MR imaging in detecting parametrial involvement. In patients with cervical carcinoma, precise knowledge of parametrial tumor extension affects the therapeutic decision between surgery and radiation therapy. The purpose of this prospective study was to determine the efficacy of MR imaging in detecting the presence or absence of parametrial invasion in patients with cervical cancer thought clinically to be confined to the cervix. Twenty-five consecutive patients were included in the study. All patients underwent radical hysterectomy or total abdominal hysterectomy and had detailed histologic evaluation of the parametrium. Ten had pathologic evidence of parametrial invasion; in the remaining 15, no parametrial invasion was identified pathologically. MR findings were compared with pathologic findings in all cases. For determining parametrial involvement, MR imaging had an accuracy of 88%, a sensitivity of 100%, and a specificity of 80%. Our results suggest that MR imaging is a reliable means of assessing parametrial invasion by cervical cancer. ",0
"Noninvasive assessment of cardiac output in children using impedance cardiography. This study evaluated the effect of intracardiac shunting on the accuracy of thoracic bioimpedance-derived cardiac output determinations. Twenty-six patients, ranging in age from 3 months to 17 years, underwent cardiac catheterization during which simultaneous Fick and impedance measurements of cardiac output were obtained. The subjects were divided into three groups: 10 children with no intracardiac shunts, nine children with predominant left-to-right intracardiac shunts, and seven children with predominant right-to-left intracardiac shunts. Positive correlations between impedance and Fick-derived cardiac output determinations were obtained in the non-shunt group (r = 0.84), with lower correlations in the left-to-right shunt group (r = 0.70). In the right-to-left shunt group, the impedance derived cardiac output correlated with Fick pulmonary flow (r = 0.82), but the variability was unacceptably large. Although further study is needed, impedance cardiography appears to have validity as a methodology in pediatric critical care and cardiovascular health research. ",0
"Spinal cord compression from a thoracic paraganglioma: case report. A 34-year-old man with a 4-month history of midthoracic back pain sought treatment for a recent onset of lower extremity paresthesia and stiffness. A myelogram and computed tomographic myelogram disclosed an extradural block at the level of the 8th thoracic vertebral body with involvement of the pedicles, lamina, and spinous process. A posterior decompression of the spinal cord with subtotal resection of a highly vascular tumor was performed. The tumor was identified as a paraganglioma. In a second stage, the remainder of the tumor was embolized preoperatively, and gross total excision and sequential stabilization of the spine with a Luque rectangle and sublaminar wires were performed. The patient has been symptom free and without signs of a recurrence in the spine for over 13 months. A large abdominal paraganglioma was recently resected from its probable origin from the adventitia of the abdominal aorta. ",0
"Is emotional disturbance a precipitator or a consequence of chronic pain? The present study examined the relationship between psychological factors and pain in order to assess the contribution of emotional disturbance to the perpetuation of pain. A group of 163 chronic pain suffers in multiple settings was compared with 81 control subjects on measures of personal history antecedent to pain onset, as well as on measures of current emotional disturbance. In addition, these psychological variables were examined for their associations with subjectively rated pain intensity. Overall, pain was found to be related to more current depression and less current life satisfaction, but was not associated with most of the personal history variables examined. These results suggests that emotional disturbance in pain patients is more likely to be a consequence than a cause of chronic pain. The dangers of routinely ascribing intractable pain to psychological causation are discussed in the light of these findings. ",0
"Use of the Collings knife electrode for percutaneous access in difficult endourology cases. Percutaneous endourological techniques for the removal of upper urinary tract calculi and for the closed treatment of ureteropelvic junction obstruction are well described. These techniques are dependent on satisfactory percutaneous access and nephrostomy tract dilation. We used the Collings knife electrode for the creation of a nephrostomy tract in 17 patients (19 renal units) with difficult percutaneous access due to scarification, or the inability to advance a guide wire sufficiently for stabilization and dilation by conventional means. A nephrostomy tract was established successfully in all 19 procedures requiring an average of 12 minutes. Two major complications occurred that required blood transfusion and an open operation. Endourological treatment was successful in the remaining 17 cases. We believe that this technique provides an alternative to an open operation when standard access and dilation methods for endourological procedures are unsuccessful. ",0
"Optimum results of the surgical treatment of carotid territory ischemia. Continuing controversy over the role of carotid endarterectomy in stroke prevention is based largely on reports in which high perioperative morbidity and mortality rates obviate possible long-term benefit from the procedure. The purpose of this review is to examine optimal results of carotid surgery in order to describe the potential for the procedure in stroke prevention. Optimal surgical results are compared with optimal medical results in the therapy of symptomatic patients and with optimal nonsurgical results in the therapy of asymptomatic patients. Factors common to series with excellent results, such as patient selection and operative technique, are examined, and problems such as recurrent carotid stenosis and coexisting coronary disease, which continue to plague even the best surgical series, are discussed.

"Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of crural arteries. The authors dilated 103 stenosed crural arteries in 71 patients. Primary success was defined as traversing and reducing the lesion to a residual stenosis of less than 30%. This was achieved in 96% of cases. Complications included one vessel rupture and one occluding intimal flap, which were treated by the vascular surgeon with bypass and venous patch, respectively. One hematoma at the puncture site was treated surgically because of its size. With modern materials such as steerable guide wires and low-profile balloon catheters, dilation of crural arteries has become safe. Until now, the indications for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of crural arteries have been limited to Fontaine stages III and IV disease. The authors believe that the indications for PTA in Fontaine stage IIb disease are justified, especially if intervention improves outflow after a more proximal recanalizing procedure is performed.

"Aneurysmal dilatation in saphenous vein bypass grafts. Three patients are reported who developed aneurysmal degeneration of a saphenous vein arterial bypass graft. All three had hypercholesterolemia and two had marked elevation of triglycerides. One bypass was for occlusive disease and two for popliteal aneurysm. There was a long lag, 3 to 7 years between graft implantation and aneurysmal degeneration. The pathology was similar for all three cases with lipid laden macrophages, loss of elastic lamina, and other atherosclerotic changes in the vein wall. While atheromatous changes and aneurysm formation in saphenous vein bypass grafts are rare, this may occur especially in patients with hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia. Careful and prolonged follow-up plus vigorous management of the hyperlipidemic state is mandatory in these patients. ",0
"Calcium and calcium binding in human gallstone disease. Precipitation of calcium salts from bile is important in pigment gallstone formation and may serve as a nidus for cholesterol precipitation. We compared gallbladder bile from patients with symptomatic gallstone disease (40 with cholesterol gallstones and 12 with pigment gallstones) with bile from 10 patients undergoing surgery for non-biliary tract disease. Bile from patients with gallstone disease was less concentrated, with decreased sodium, bile salt, and phospholipid concentrations, but elevated biliary calcium concentrations were not observed. The relationship between free ionized calcium and total calcium was similar in all groups, indicating no difference in calcium binding by gallstone-containing bile. We cannot exclude elevated biliary calcium level as a factor in gallstone pathogenesis, as it could be a transient event. The importance of calcium precipitation was supported by our finding that more than half of the samples were saturated or supersaturated with at least one calcium salt, calcium carbonate. ",0
"Porokeratoses: immunohistochemical, light and electron microscopic evaluation. Punch biopsy specimens of 14 patients with porokeratosis of Mibelli (n = 1), disseminated superficial porokeratosis (n = 6), disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (n = 4), porokeratosis plantaris, palmaris et disseminata (n = 2), and punctate porokeratosis (n = 1) were obtained for light and electron microscopy for evaluation of possible differences between these clinical variants. Langerhans cells in close contact with early degenerating keratinocytes could be observed in the epidermis. To study the cellular composition of the epidermal inflammatory infiltrate immunohistochemistry was performed. These studies demonstrated that the predominant cell type in these infiltrates are helper T cells, intermingled with Leu-6+ Langerhans cells. Despite the clinical variation and possible different etiologic or triggering mechanisms, the immunohistochemical and morphologic changes in all types of porokeratosis are the same and seem to represent a uniform reaction pattern.

"Effect of electrocautery on wound healing in midline laparotomy incisions. The effect of electrocautery on midline fascial wound healing was studied in 108 Sprague-Dawley rats. Midline wound tensile strength was significantly reduced in fascia incised with the coagulation current compared with the cutting current or scalpel. In addition, tissue necrosis and inflammation as well as adhesion formation between the incision and abdominal viscera were more extensive in animals with incisions made using coagulation current. The results of the study indicate that the use of electrocautery coagulation current is associated with increased tissue damage and a significant reduction in the tensile strength of healing wounds. The contribution of electrocautery to wound complications in patients needs further evaluation. ",0
"Percutaneous transperineal prostate cryosurgery using transrectal ultrasound guidance: animal model. Cryosurgery has previously been used successfully to treat prostatic carcinoma. Inability to monitor the freezing led to local complications that limited the use of this modality. Recent studies have shown that monitoring of the freezing process can be accomplished using real-time ultrasound. In this study, transrectal ultrasound guidance was used to guide a cryoprobe percutaneously, using a transperineal approach, into the prostate. The extent of freezing was then monitored using ultrasound, taking care not to freeze the urethra or the rectum. Six dogs had the procedure without any complications. This study demonstrates the feasibility of a noninvasive treatment for prostatic carcinoma. ",0
"Metastatic small cell tumor of bone with 'true' rosettes and glial fibrillary acidic protein positivity. A 15-year-old black girl was admitted to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital with a lytic lesion involving the right fourth metacarpal bone with a solitary metastasis to the ipsilateral axillary lymph node. Histologic examination of both the primary lesion and metastasis revealed a primitive small round cell lesion. Abundant rosettes with central lumina were present in the metastasis. Immunohistochemical stains performed on sections of the metastasis were strongly positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and negative for neuron-specific enolase (NSE), S-100 protein, and Leu-7. Electron microscopic examination of the metastasis revealed lumen formation with apical microvilli and juxtaluminal junctional complexes. This tumor exhibits features that are suggestive, but not definitive, of primitive ependymal differentiation and further expands the morphologic and immunophenotypic range of small round cell tumors of bone.

"The butterfly rash and the malar flush. What diseases do these signs reflect? The butterfly rash and malar flush are common facial manifestations of several disorders. Systemic lupus erythematosus may produce a transient rash before any other signs. In pellagra, symmetric keratotic areas on the face are always accompanied by lesions elsewhere on the body. Erysipelas produces brawny, fiery red facial lesions, and scarlet fever causes facial eruptions as part of a generalized eruption. Lupus vulgaris and lupus pernio produce nodules that may spread in a butterfly pattern, and seborrheic dermatitis has a predilection for the malar prominences and other areas of the face. Carcinoid syndrome often causes flushing attacks that vary in duration, and facial flushing that lasts throughout treatment may accompany chemotherapy if the patient has a hypersensitivity reaction. Deep-red rashes and/or lichenoid lesions may be caused by graft-versus-host disease in a patient undergoing bone marrow transplantation. ",0
"Toxic epidermal necrolysis after bone marrow transplantation: study of nine cases. Acute graft-versus-host reaction after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation has been reported to induce toxic epidermal necrolysis. To assess the respective role of acute graft-versus-host disease and of drug reaction in this setting, we retrospectively reviewed nine cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis that occurred in a series of 152 allogenic bone marrow recipients. In five cases visceral involvement was suggestive of acute graft-versus-host disease without any drug more than ""doubtfully"" suspected. In four cases extracutaneous symptoms were absent or mild and suspect drugs (mainly sulfonamides) had been administered with a timing suggestive of ""possible"" causality. All nine patients died, mainly from infection possibly aggravated by high doses of corticosteroids. We conclude that toxic epidermal necrolysis may be more frequent than generally thought after bone marrow transplantation and has a poor prognosis. It seems to be related to a drug reaction to sulfonamides as often as to acute graft-versus-host disease. ",0
"Radical prostatectomy for clinical stage T1-2N0M0 prostatic adenocarcinoma: long-term results. A total of 441 stage T1-2N0M0 and 11 stage T1-2N0M0 cancer patients with an elevated acid phosphatase level only, and 18 stage T1-2N+M0 cancer patients underwent radical prostatectomy. Analysis of the 441 stage T1-2N0M0 cancer patients demonstrated that failure and survival were a function of the disease being organ-confined, specimen-confined or margin-positive, with 10-year failure rates of 12, 30 and 60%, respectively. Of the patients with positive margins 44 were and 79 were not irradiated postoperatively. Postoperative radiation produced no survival advantage. No difference in interval to failure or of survival could be identified between 105 patients whose disease was diagnosed by transurethral resection and 328 who had a palpable abnormality. Eleven patients had negative bone and node findings but they had an elevated acid phosphatase level. All 8 patients not treated with immediate androgen deprivation failed within 36 months. ",0
"Bacterial meningitis: an update. Antibiotics and improvements in supportive care have greatly reduced the mortality from bacterial meningitis. Nevertheless, the incidence of neurodevelopmental sequelae remains unacceptably high. Ampicillin and chloramphenicol remain the standard for antimicrobial therapy against which other agents must be compared. A number of adjunct therapies are being investigated for their possible effectiveness in reducing hearing loss and other neurologic effects of this disease. There continues to be a need for carefully performed follow-up studies to assess any possible benefit of these agents. A significant percentage of children surviving an episode of bacterial meningitis have obvious or subtle neurodevelopmental deficits. The role of the pediatric neurologist should not end with management of acute problems such as seizures but should be expanded to aid in close developmental monitoring of these high-risk children.

"X-linked spinal muscular atrophy (Kennedy's syndrome). A kindred with hypobetalipoproteinemia. Kennedy's syndrome, X-linked adult-onset bulbospinal muscular atrophy, has been described in over 30 families. The characteristic distribution of weakness creates a recognizable syndrome, augmented by frequent findings of testicular atrophy and gynecomastia. Type IV or type II hyperlipoproteinemia has been found in some families. We have studied another family with Kennedy's syndrome, this one with hypobetalipoproteinemia. The diversity of serum patterns suggests that lipoprotein abnormalities are not causally related to either the endocrinopathy or the spinal muscular atrophy. However, gene linkage studies indicate proximity of the gene for Kennedy's syndrome and the gene encoding the androgen receptor, which could explain the combination of a motor neuron disorder and the endocrine abnormalities.

"Molecular analysis of acute promyelocytic leukemia breakpoint cluster region on chromosome 17. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL; FAB M3) is characterized by a predominance of malignant promyelocytes that carry a reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 15 and 17, t(15;17) (q22;q11.2-q12). This translocation has become diagnostic for APL, as it is present in almost 100 percent of cases. A Not I linking clone was used to detect this translocation initially on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and subsequently with conventional Southern (DNA) analysis. The breakpoints in ten APL cases examined were shown to cluster in a 12-kb region of chromosome 17, containing two CpG-rich islands. The region is the first intron of the retinoic acid receptor alpha gene (RARA). ",0
"Incidence of cutaneous T cell lymphoma and other rare skin cancers in a defined population. Between 1970 and 1984 in Rochester, Minnesota, rare skin cancers developed in 15 local residents: cutaneous T cell lymphoma (six subjects), dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (four), adenocarcinoma of sweat glands (two), Merkel cell carcinoma (one), liposarcoma (one), and extramammary Paget's disease (one). These cases were identified through a unique computerized retrieval system that is maintained at the Mayo Clinic for the population of Rochester, Minnesota. The annual incidences of these cancers in the Rochester population were 0.9, 0.5, 0.3, 0.2, 0.2, and 0.2 per 100,000 residents, respectively (standardized to 1980 U.S. population). To our knowledge, this is the first report of the incidences of these rare skin cancers in a well-defined population. ",0
"The Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome examined by computed tomography, magnetic resonance, and 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose and positron emission tomography. The Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome is an autosomal recessive degenerative disorder characterized by congenital cataracts, cerebellar ataxia, spasticity, mental deficiency, and skeletal abnormalities. We studied two adult siblings with Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome using anatomic and metabolic brain imaging techniques to characterize the pattern and nature of abnormalities in the brain. Computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging showed diffuse brain atrophy of mild to moderate degree, involving primarily the white matter of the cerebrum, cerebellum, brain stem, and cervical spinal cord. The pattern of atrophy resembled that seen in diffuse leukoencephalopathies. Measurements of local cerebral glucose metabolic rates with positron emission tomography revealed no statistically significant differences from normal control subjects in most regions, but metabolic rate was decreased in the thalamus in one patient. The findings support a diffuse white matter disorder in Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome. ",0
"Neuroexcitatory plasma amino acids are elevated in migraine. To investigate the role of glutamic (Glu) and aspartic acid (Asp) in migraine, we measured the plasma amino acids in migraine patients with and without aura, between and during attacks, and compared the profiles with the plasma amino acid profiles of tension headache patients and healthy controls. Between attacks, migraineurs (notably with aura) had substantially higher plasma Glu and Asp levels than did controls and tension headache patients. In addition, patients with migraine without aura showed low plasma histidine levels. During migraine attacks, Glu (and to a lesser extent Asp) levels were even further increased. The results suggest a defective cellular reuptake mechanism for Glu and Asp in migraineurs, and we hypothesize a similar defect at the neuronal/glial cell level, predisposing the brain of migraineurs to develop spreading depression.

"Medical treatment and prevention of peptic ulcer disease. Many agents seem to be equally effective for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease. This is true despite the drugs' varied mechanisms of action, and this observation has caused investigators to shift their focus from aggressive to defensive factors when studying ulcer pathogenesis. Patients with a healed ulcer are always at risk for recurrence, and guidelines are available for management of these patients. Ulcer prevention becomes a crucial issue in intensive care units where critically ill patients have many known risk factors. Maintaining a gastric pH above 4.0 appears to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with such stress-induced ulcers. Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs increases ulcer risk and complications in the elderly, in women with rheumatoid arthritis, and in smokers and abusers of alcohol. Prophylaxis with the synthetic prostaglandin analogue misoprostol (Cytotec) appears to reduce this risk. ",0
"Cause of death in an emergency department A retrospective review was done of 601 consecutive emergency department deaths. Nontrauma causes accounted for 77% of the deaths and this group had an average age of 64 years and a male to female ratio of 1.9:1. Trauma caused 23% of the fatalities and this group had a younger average age of 29 years and a male to female ratio of 4.6:1. The most common causes of nontrauma death were sudden death of uncertain cause (34%), coronary artery disease (34%), cancer (5%), other heart disease (4%), chronic obstructive lung disease (3%), drug overdose (3%), and sudden infant death syndrome (2%). The most common causes of trauma death were motor vehicle accidents (61%) and gunshot wounds (16%). The overall autopsy rate was 40%. Death certificates were often in error. ",0
"Carboplatin in childhood brain tumors. A Children's Cancer Study Group Phase II trial. Between October 1985 and March 1988, Children's Cancer Study Group institutions entered 95 patients with recurrent brain tumors into a Phase II trial of carboplatin 560 mg/m2 every 4 weeks. Complete or partial responses were observed for one of 19 evaluable children with brainstem glioma, two of 14 with ependymoma, six of 19 with medulloblastoma or central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET), and none of 15 with high-grade astrocytoma. Of 33 children with medulloblastoma, ependymoma, or central nervous system PNET, five of 12 with no prior cisplatin exposure had responses, and two of 21 with prior cisplatin exposure had responses (P = 0.03). Thirty-four percent of patients had absolute neutrophil count nadirs less than 500/microliters, and 37% had platelet count nadirs less than 25,000/microliters. Sixteen percent had moderate to severe otoxicity, 10% had nausea and vomiting, and none had nephrotoxicity. ",0
The operative management of coexisting thyroid and parathyroid disease. Three hundred eight patients who underwent operation for hyperparathyroidism were studied. Fifty-two (17%) were identified who had a concomitant thyroid nodule. All 52 underwent parathyroidectomy and thyroid resection in a single operation. Eleven of these patients (21% of those with a thyroid nodule) had differentiated thyroid cancer. One patient with parathyroid hyperplasia developed permanent hypocalcemia. None had permanent vocal cord paralysis and none required tracheostomy. Thorough visual inspection and palpation of the entire thyroid gland should be performed during operations for hyperparathyroidism. Incidentally discovered thyroid nodules should prompt formal lobectomy with frozen section diagnosis; unanticipated thyroid malignancies should then be treated as independent entities. Treating simultaneous hyperparathyroidism and nodular thyroid disease with a single operation can be done safely; it avoids the expense and risk associated with neck reexploration and can detect unsuspected cancers. ,0
"Surgical aspects of sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis. Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis (SEP) is associated with the administration of beta-blocking agents as well as continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. The predisposing factors in the latter group are recurrent peritonitis, presence of acetate in the dialysate, and antiseptics used during bag exchanges. We report a case of SEP following chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and review the literature on this benign yet potentially lethal condition. Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis frequently leads to intestinal obstruction, small-bowel necrosis, enterocutaneous fistulas, and malnutrition. There is a high incidence of anastomotic failure when a resection and primary intestinal anastomosis is performed in patients with SEP. Although SEP is not commonly reported in the surgical literature, its importance to surgeons is indicated by the fact that the overall mortality rate is close to 60% in patients with SEP who develop surgical complications.

"Immunohistologic localization of alpha, mu, and pi class glutathione S-transferases in human tissues. Human alpha, pi, and mu class glutathione S-transferases (GSH S-T) have been localized immunohistologically in a variety of organs. Alpha GSH S-T are found principally in hepatocytes, proximal convoluted tubules of kidney, the deep reticular layer of the adrenal gland, interstitial cells of the testis, and oxyntic cells of the stomach. The pi GSH S-T are present in relative abundance in ductular, as opposed to parenchymal cells in the liver, pancreas, salivary glands, and kidney. The presence of mu GSH S-T in the tissues of certain patients and its absence in the same tissues from other patients has been demonstrated. The pi GSH S-T seems to be most persistently and strongly expressed in tumors but alpha GSH S-T are also found in some neoplasms whereas the mu GSH S-T are occasionally present when the other two transferases are weak or absent.

"Comparison of shunt fraction estimation using transcolonic iodine-123-iodoamphetamine and technetium-99m-pertechnetate in a group of dogs with experimentally-induced chronic biliary cirrhosis. Portosystemic shunt fraction estimation using transcolonic iodine-123-iodoamphetamine (IMP) has been previously validated relative to portal vein macroaggregated albumin injections using an experimental model of cirrhosis. Transcolonic technetium-99m-pertechnetate (TcO4-) has been proposed as an alternative tracer to IMP to study portal circulation in cirrhotic patients. We compared shunt fraction estimates from paired transcolonic IMP and TcO4- studies performed on a group of dogs before and after common bile duct ligation surgery. Pertechnetate over-estimated shunt fraction in 6/7 postoperative studies relative to IMP. A good correlation between the two methods was demonstrated, however, the slope of the regression line was substantially less than 1.0 with TcO4- values reaching 100% at IMP shunt values of approximately 60%. This apparent inability to accurately assess high shunt flows may limit the quantitative aspects of TcO4- studies on patients with severe portosystemic shunting. ",0
"Decreased local toxicity with subcutaneous diamorphine (heroin): a preliminary report. We report the cases of 5 patients who developed severe local toxicity during the subcutaneous administration of morphine sulphate and hydromorphone hydrochloride. All patients required site changes more frequently than once every 24 h due to redness, swelling, or pain while receiving morphine or hydromorphone. All patients showed prolongation in the duration of sites of infusion once an equianalgesic dose of diamorphine hydrochloride (heroin) was started. No change in pain control or systemic toxicity was detected with diamorphine. These findings suggest that diamorphine could be a useful alternative for patients who develop severe toxicity to subcutaneous morphine or hydromorphone. ",0
"Progression of stage T1 bladder tumors after intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin [published erratum appears in J Urol 1991 Apr;145(4):840] Of 221 patients with superficial bladder tumors (stages Ta, Tis and T1) treated by transurethral resection and an initial 6-week course of intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) 195 were evaluated after 3 months for local response. Of these patients 17 (8.7%) had a stage T1 tumor, of whom 14 (82%) subsequently had muscle invasion (7), uncontrolled local disease (6) or metastasis (1). The median interval to progression was 8.4 months, which was significantly (p = 0.0001) less than among the other 178 patients with a nonstage T1 lesion or no tumor found at 3 months, of whom 44 (25%) had progression (median more than 5 years). These data suggest that patients with stage T1 tumor 3 months after BCG therapy require additional therapy other than simple tumor resection and meticulous followup. ",0
"Indwelling epidural catheters for pain control in gynecologic cancer patients. Seven patients with severe pain caused by an advanced, incurable gynecologic malignancy were treated with an indwelling epidural catheter connected to an implantable subcutaneous port through which morphine was infused. There were few major complications associated with insertion or maintenance of the system. The average usage was 60 days, although the system functioned continuously for 6 months in one patient. Pain distribution in these women ranged from the upper abdomen to the lower extremities. All patients, including one with liver metastases, reported good to excellent pain control with the epidural narcotics. Two subjects with upper abdominal pain occasionally required supplemental oral oxycodone, but the other five patients had adequate pain relief with the epidural system alone. The indwelling epidural system provides excellent analgesia for patients with advanced, incurable gynecologic cancer. ",0
"Outpatient laparoscopic laser cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic laser cholecystectomy has been performed clinically in the United States since 1988. After refinement of the technique, the procedure was offered on an outpatient basis. Eighty-three patients underwent laparoscopic laser cholecystectomy during the study period. Thirty-seven (45%) had the procedure as an outpatient. Younger patients were more suited for the outpatient procedure and those without previous surgery were more likely to have the procedure done as an outpatient. Weight, operating time, and gallbladder pathology were similar, although patients with acute inflammation of the gallbladder were more likely to require hospitalization. The primary reason for patient admission was patient preference. ",0
"Marijuana smoking as a possible cause of tongue carcinoma in young patients. A case of T1N0M0 carcinoma of the tongue in a male 23-year-old 'regular' marijuana smoker is described. Hemiglossectomy and complete bilateral neck dissection were carried out. No post-operative radiotherapy was given as the resection margins were histologically negative. The tumour recurred one year later in the left cervical region involving the mandible and surgery was again performed, but after three months, neck disease was still evident. The case described case implies the introduction of marijuana as a possible new risk factor in the development of oral cavity tumours. Resection of the primary lesion has to be as wide as possible even in T1 cases, due to the aggressive biological behaviour of such tumours in young subjects. ",0
"Use of activated charcoal to reduce elevated serum phenobarbital concentration in a neonate. The course of a neonate administered activated charcoal orally for elevated phenobarbital concentration is described. The neonate required a serum concentration of phenobarbital eventually exceeding 80 micrograms/mL for seizure control. However, due to the severe CNS injury as a result of the asphyxia at birth, a diagnosis of cerebral death by electroencephalogram and apnea test was pursued. This required the phenobarbital concentration to be less than 30 micrograms/mL. Serial phenobarbital concentrations during this time indicated a 250 hour half-life, which would require two weeks for the phenobarbital to drop below 30 micrograms/mL. With the administration of six doses of activated charcoal at 0.7 g/kg/dose, the phenobarbital serum concentration decreased to 22 micrograms/mL, giving an estimated phenobarbital half-life of 22 hours. This, and two other subsequent cases, indicates repeated doses of activated charcoal are effective in augmenting the clearance of certain drugs in the neonatal age group. ",0
"Infrarenal abdominal aortic disease: a review of the retroperitoneal approach. Transabdominal exposure is the most widely used surgical approach to the infrarenal aorta. Over the last 30 years a number of surgeons have championed the retroperitoneal approach for repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms and aortoiliac occlusive disease using a variety of incisions. Several studies attest to the clinical superiority of this approach over the transabdominal route and recent evidence demonstrates reduced physiological disturbance with this technique. The retroperitoneal approach is suitable for all elective operations on the abdominal aorta, particularly in patients with high-risk aneurysms and in selected patients with symptomatic and ruptured aneurysms.

"Prognosticating study for cervical myelopathy using evoked spinal cord potentials. One hundred twenty-three cases of cervical spondylotic and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) myelopathy cases with long tract signs subjected to surgical treatment were studied to identify the most important factors having an influence on postoperative outcome using evoked spinal cord potentials (ESCP). Disappearance and positive wave changes of these potentials at the level of responsible lesions and slow conduction velocity under 40 m indicated an unsatisfactory outcome. Localized-lesion cases diagnosed by ESCPs had excellent results, significantly more so than extensive-lesion cases, regardless of operative methods. In 123 cases, 76% were found to have localized lesions, while the other 24% showed extensive lesions. Concerning the difference between CSM and OPLL, 54% of OPLL and only 14% of CSM demonstrated extensive lesions. ",0
"Mammographic follow-up of low-suspicion lesions: compliance rate and diagnostic yield. All recommendations for mammographic follow-up of low-suspicion lesions seen at mammography during a 6-month period were reviewed to establish compliance rate and eventual outcome. One hundred forty-four of 2,650 mammograms (5%) showed minimal abnormalities that warranted short-term and periodic mammographic follow-up. Rates of compliance at 4 months and at 1, 2, and 3 years were 88%, 71%, 60%, and 47%, respectively. Progressive mammographic change was found in 10 patients, only one of whom had a carcinoma. It was concluded that mammographic follow-up of low-suspicion lesions is a reasonable alternative to surgical biopsy, although patient compliance remains a significant problem. ",0
"An analysis of abnormalities of the retinoblastoma gene in human ovarian and endometrial carcinoma. The altered expression of the human retinoblastoma (RB) gene has been demonstrated to play an important role in the pathogenesis of RB and other tumors. To determine whether the RB gene might be involved in the pathogenesis of human ovarian and endometrial cancer, DNA from 24 human ovarian tumors, 3 normal ovaries, 3 endometrial carcinomas, and 1 endometrial hyperplasia was examined with an RB complementary DNA probe. Evidence for homozygous deletion of the RB gene was observed in only one specimen. Interestingly, the specimen was an endometrioid tumor of the ovary of low malignant potential (LMP). This patient experienced rapid progression of the tumor and died 8 months after diagnosis. Abnormalities of the RB gene may be involved in the aggressive biologic behavior of certain forms of ovarian carcinoma, particularly those of LMP. ",0
"Adenocarcinoma arising in Barrett's esophagus after total gastrectomy A 64-yr-old Japanese male who underwent a partial gastrectomy for a duodenal ulcer at the age of 21, a total resection of the remnant stomach for a stomal ulcer at age 25, and in whom Barrett's esophagus was diagnosed at age 47, was found to have a tumor at the distal esophagus and was operated on by thoracic esophagectomy. The tumor was a well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma invading down to the muscularis propria. The entire esophageal mucosa in the resected specimen was lined by columnar epithelium. This tumor was thought to derive from the Barrett's esophageal epithelium. ",0
"Chronic diarrhea in essential mixed cryoglobulinemia: a manifestation of visceral vasculitis? Gastrointestinal involvement occurs frequently in essential mixed cryoglobulinemia, and most often involves the liver and spleen. Intestinal involvement is much less common and is generally felt to be a late and often catastrophic manifestation of the disease due to severe vasculitis. Occasionally, the disorder mimics inflammatory bowel disease, both clinically and radiographically. We recently cared for a patient with essential mixed cryoglobulinemia who developed persistent diarrhea. Endoscopic evaluation revealed scattered petechial lesions in the duodenum and colon as well as prominent lymphoid hyperplasia in the terminal ileum. Mucosal biopsies disclosed the presence of diffuse inflammation. We suggest that this patient's diarrhea was due to intestinal vasculitis and that prominent ileal lymphoid hyperplasia may be a manifestation of essential mixed cryoglobulinemia. ",0
"Fatigue failure of noncemented porous-coated implants. A retrieval study. The causes of mechanical failure of five noncemented porous-coated components were studied. There were two cobalt-chromium alloy and three titanium alloy implants which fractured after 12 to 48 months. The implants included one acetabular component, and one femoral condylar, one patellar and two tibial components. Examination of the fractured surfaces revealed fatigue to be the mechanism of failure in all cases. The porous coating and the processes required for its fabrication had resulted in weakening and reduction of substrate thickness. Additional factors were stress concentration due to limited, localised bone ingrowth, and some features of the design of the implants. ",0
"Microscopic pulmonary tumor embolism causing subacute cor pulmonale: a difficult antemortem diagnosis [published erratum appears in Mayo Clin Proc 1991 Apr;66(4):439] Microscopic pulmonary tumor embolism is difficult to diagnose. The most common initial clinical symptom is subacute progressive dyspnea, and the initial laboratory evaluation typically shows hypoxemia in a patient with clear lung fields on a chest roentgenogram. Another distinguishing feature may be hepatic abnormalities. In general, pulmonary angiography discloses no evidence of emboli, but multiple subsegmental peripheral perfusion defects are noted on ventilation-perfusion lung scans. The diagnosis of microscopic pulmonary tumor embolism can be confirmed by open-lung or transbronchial lung biopsy or by microvascular pulmonary cytology, a less invasive procedure that could be performed at the time of pulmonary angiography. Herein we describe two patients with unsuspected microscopic pulmonary tumor embolism that eventuated in subacute cor pulmonale and death. These cases illustrate the characteristic findings of this entity and emphasize the need for early diagnosis. ",0
"Heart weights of white men 20 to 39 years of age. An analysis of 218 autopsy cases. Review of autopsy data for 218 white men between 20 and 39 years of age who died of injuries or suddenly and unexpectedly indicated a mean heart weight of 371 g. The mean for those dying of external causes was 364 g whereas the mean for those dying of natural causes was 446 g. A coefficient for heart weight expressed as a percentage of body weight was lower in heavy individuals than lightweight individuals; it ranged between 0.38% and 0.55%, with a mean of 0.48%. Heart weight, including epicardial fat, increased with age and body weight. These data may be useful to those who are called upon to investigate sudden and unexpected deaths. ",0
"Air in the fissure for the ligamentum teres: new sign of intraperitoneal air on plain radiographs. In each of four patients in whom an acute spontaneous pneumoperitoneum developed, a vertically directed area of hyperlucency in the right upper quadrant was seen on radiographs of the abdomen obtained with the patient supine. This finding, which appeared in the absence of other characteristic signs of free air on plain radiographs and which, to the authors' knowledge, has not been previously recognized, represented intraperitoneal gas confined to the fissure for the ligamentum teres (FLT). The location of the hyperlucent area was confirmed with computed tomography or laparotomy in each patient. The distinctive configuration of air in the FLT is a subtle but reliable indicator of pneumoperitoneum. ",0
"99mTc HM-PAO SPECT in pediatric migraine. 99mTC HM-PAO SPECT brain imaging was performed during the headache-free period in 19 young migraineurs, affected by common migraine (CM, 10 cases), classic migraine (CLM, 6 cases) and hemiplegic migraine (HM, 3 cases). SPECT findings were negative in all 10 patients with CM, in 3 cases of CLM and in 2 cases of HM. Positive findings in the remaining 4 patients (3 cases of CLM and 1 of HM) showed a decreased tracer distribution in the temporo-occipital regions (2 cases) and parietal regions (2 cases): the two with decreased temporo-occipital perfusion reported prodromal symptoms exclusively contralateral to the areas of hypoperfusion. An impaired regional cerebral vascular autoregulation may exist even during headache-free intervals in patients suffering from classic and hemiplegic migraine. ",0
"A T-cell neoplasia showing clinicopathologic features of malignant histiocytosis with novel chromosomal abnormalities and N-ras mutation. Malignant histiocytosis (MH) is a distinct disease entity defined clinically and morphologically. However, the neoplastic origin of MH is not well established. The authors report a 26-year-old woman who showed the typical clinicopathologic features of so-called MH. Cytogenetic and molecular genetic examinations were performed in addition to the morphologic and immunologic approach. The expression of CD2 and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements indicated the T-cell origin of this case. CD30, which is positive for anaplastic large cell lymphoma (Ki-1 lymphoma), was not expressed. The cytogenetic study revealed a clonal chromosome abnormality involving 3q25, 6p21, 11p15, and 11q21. An N-ras point mutation within codon 12 (GGT----GCT) was also detected. These finding indicate that MH defined clinically and morphologically is not a tumor of true histiocytic origin and that it should be reclassified on the basis of immunologic, cytogenetic, and molecular genetic data.

"The effect of metoclopramide on ovarian responsiveness to gonadotropin administration in patients with severe polycystic ovarian syndrome. Six patients with poor ovarian response to menotropin after pretreatment with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog exhibited improved ovarian responsiveness when metoclopramide was added on days 3, 5, and 7 of the cycle. This was evidenced by a higher number of leading follicles (4.4 versus 0.6), a higher mean of maximal serum 17 beta-estradiol levels (560 versus 178 pg/mL), a shorter duration of menotropin treatment (7 versus 11 days), and fewer ampules of menotropin used (20 versus 37 ampules/cycle) in metoclopramide-treated cycles as compared with control cycles, respectively. Serum prolactin levels reached a maximum of 172 ng/mL within 1 hour after metoclopramide administration and declined to normal range within 6 hours. These results suggest that intermittent increased prolactin secretion may augment ovarian response to gonadotropins. ",0
"Treating systemic fungal infections in AIDS patients. Prolonging life against the odds. Fungal infections have become one of the major causes of death among immunocompromised patients, particularly patients with AIDS. Accurate and quick diagnosis is difficult; therefore, empirical therapy is often necessary. This scenario is complicated by the fact that most antifungal agents are toxic at the doses used or relatively ineffective against deep-seated mycoses. Because the population of AIDS patients is increasing, physicians will be faced more often with the management of systemic fungal infections. Despite the current bleak prognosis for these patients, several new antigen detection tests are being developed and triazole agents are proving to be effective and less toxic than their predecessors. Many cases of systemic mycoses do result in mortality, but appropriate treatment can both prolong life and improve its quality. ",0
"Is emotional disturbance a precipitator or a consequence of chronic pain? The present study examined the relationship between psychological factors and pain in order to assess the contribution of emotional disturbance to the perpetuation of pain. A group of 163 chronic pain suffers in multiple settings was compared with 81 control subjects on measures of personal history antecedent to pain onset, as well as on measures of current emotional disturbance. In addition, these psychological variables were examined for their associations with subjectively rated pain intensity. Overall, pain was found to be related to more current depression and less current life satisfaction, but was not associated with most of the personal history variables examined. These results suggests that emotional disturbance in pain patients is more likely to be a consequence than a cause of chronic pain. The dangers of routinely ascribing intractable pain to psychological causation are discussed in the light of these findings. ",0
"Decision criteria for pure-tone detection used by two age groups of normal-hearing and hearing-impaired listeners. Response criteria from a yes-no task and detection thresholds from two test procedures were measured for four groups of adults: younger normal-hearing, older normal-hearing, younger hearing-impaired, and older hearing-impaired. The two test procedures were an audiological procedure (which does not control for response bias) and a 21FC adaptive procedure (which does control for bias). The signal was a 500 or 4000 Hz tone presented in quiet. All four groups showed an equally conservative response bias in the yes-no task. In addition, neither age nor hearing loss affected the difference (6.5 dB) between the two threshold measures. ",0
"Analysis of alterations in the retinoblastoma gene and tumor grade in bone and soft-tissue sarcomas. We examined 43 sporadic bone and soft-tissue sarcomas for molecular genetic alterations affecting the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene Rb-1 (also known as RB1). The gene was altered in 6 of 14 sporadic osteosarcomas and in 5 of 29 other bone and soft-tissue sarcomas. Rb-1 messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts were detected in normal tissues and benign lipomas, but they were absent or altered in each of the 19 sarcomas we examined. To examine the association of deletions in the Rb-1 gene with tumor grade, we correlated the DNA alterations in the Rb-1 gene with clinical data for 36 patients. The Rb-1 gene was altered in 40% of high-grade bone and soft-tissue tumors, but not in low-grade bone tumors and in only one low-grade, soft-tissue sarcoma. Overall, 10 of 25 high-grade sarcomas had detectable alterations of the Rb-1 gene compared with only 1 of 11 low-grade tumors. ",0
"Pineal hyperactivity in spontaneously hypertensive rats: muscarinic regulation of indole metabolism. 1. Choline acetyltransferase activity and [3H]quinuclidinyl benzylate-binding sites were detected in the pineal gland of normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats and of spontaneously hypertensive rats. 2. In vitro, muscarinic activation by pilocarpine increased the pineal metabolic production of hydroxyindole derivatives up to 5-hydroxytryptamine and produced a less marked stimulation of melatonin biosynthesis. 3. Electrical field stimulation of pineal gland slices caused similar metabolic effects. 4. Muscarinic blockade with atropine inhibited the effects on hydroxyindole metabolism. 5. [3H]Quinuclidinyl benzylate-binding sites, indicative of muscarinic receptors, were more numerous, and basal 5-hydroxytryptamine and melatonin levels were higher, in the pineal gland of spontaneously hypertensive rats compared with Wistar-Kyoto rats. 6. The atropine-sensitive metabolic effects of pilocarpine and electrical field stimulation on the pineal gland were increased in spontaneously hypertensive rats compared with Wistar-Kyoto rats. ",0
"Anton's syndrome in a patient with posttraumatic optic neuropathy and bifrontal contusions. We describe a patient who manifested Anton's syndrome after sustaining head trauma that resulted in optic nerve damage and bifrontal contusions. Denial of monocular blindness, generalized anosognosia, and confabulation were prominent neurobehavioral features. Anton's syndrome is most commonly encountered in patients with bilateral occipital cortex lesions. Patients previously described who demonstrated Anton's syndrome secondary to a peripheral lesion have had an associated delirium or profound dementia. Our case demonstrates that Anton's syndrome may occur in association with blindness from a peripheral lesion, even in the absence of a delirium or significant dementia. We suggest that the bifrontal dysfunction may have been a critical factor in the production of Anton's syndrome. Implications for the role of frontal lobe dysfunction in the genesis of anosognosia and confabulation are discussed. ",0
Oral squamous cell carcinoma arising in a patient with long-standing lichen planus. A case report. The risk of malignant transformation of oral lichen planus remains a controversial point. Many previous reports have been discounted on the basis of inadequate information or lack of histologic confirmation of lichen planus. We report a well-documented case of long-standing cutaneous and oral lichen planus in which squamous cell carcinoma of the dorsal portion of the tongue occurred. There is an apparent difference in the sites of oral carcinomas in patients with lichen planus compared with the general population. This suggests that lichen planus increases the risk of oral cancer in affected sites. ,0
"Pneumococcal anticapsular antibodies in patients with chronic cardiovascular and obstructive lung disease in The Netherlands. Differences in pneumococcal anticapsular antibody concentrations were assessed among patients with various chronic disorders and among young (25-35 years of age) and older adults (55-65 years). Antibody concentrations were determined by ELISA, using the whole 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine as antigen. No differences in mean or distribution of serum antibody concentrations were found among young adults (either healthy or asthmatic) or among older adults (healthy or with chronic obstructive pulmonary or chronic cardiovascular disease). Each group included individuals with low antibody levels. Therefore, the enhanced susceptibility to pneumococcal infections reported for some groups at risk, that is, elderly individuals and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary or chronic cardiovascular disease, cannot be attributed solely to low anticapsular antibody concentrations.

"Awareness during caesarean section. Between 1982 and 1989 over 3000 patients were questioned about recall and dreaming after general anaesthesia for Caesarean section. Some 28 (0.9%) patients were able to recall something of their operation and 189 (6.1%) reported dreams. There was uniform adherence to a rigid anaesthetic protocol up to and including 1985, but a much publicized incident reported from the courtroom stimulated a relaxation of this regimen. Consequently the incidence of awareness decreased from 1.3% to 0.4%, and the incidence of dreaming was also reduced. Recollections of surgery were confined to manipulations, noises and voices. None of our patients complained of pain at the time of interview, although one since has. The inadequacies of the initial protocol and an approach to informed consent are discussed. ",0
"Pancreatic ascites: treatment by continuous somatostatin infusion. Two male patients with recurrent acute pancreatitis due to alcohol abuse were admitted with pancreatic ascites (high concentration of amylase, raised protein concentration, no specific cytologic features). Ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) confirmed gross ascites and inflammation of the pancreas in both patients, and a pseudocyst in the head of the pancreas in one of them. Treatment with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and a H2-blocking agent was instituted and continued for 4 and 2 wk, respectively. Due to lack of improvement, somatostatin infusion (250 micrograms/h) was started. During the next few days, there was a rapid improvement of the clinical status, and the production of ascites ceased. We conclude that somatostatin infusion should be tried before any invasive diagnostic or therapeutic intervention in patients with pancreatic ascites. ",0
"Colorectal adenocarcinoma in patients less than 40 years of age. From 1973 to 1985, 105 patients under 40 years of age were treated for colorectal adenocarcinoma at Roswell Park Cancer Institute. There were 51 males and 54 females. The mean age was 32 years. The majority of patients were treated for left colon or rectal carcinomas. Ninety-seven of 105 patients underwent surgical resection of their primary cancer, 70 (67 percent) of which were potentially curative. Twenty-seven patients underwent palliative resections. Dukes' A or B lesions were not seen in patients less than 20 years old, whereas these early lesions were seen in 11 percent of patients 20 to 29 years old and in 26 percent of patients greater than 30 years of age. The mean survival for patients between 20 and 29 years was 39 months and 46 months for patients 30 years and older. ",0
"Periventricular hyperintensity detected by magnetic resonance imaging in infancy. Twenty-one infants younger than 12 months of age were diagnosed as having periventricular hyperintensity (PVH) on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Ten infants had experienced neonatal asphyxia, 6 intracranial hemorrhage, 2 bacterial meningitis, and 3 apnea. PVH was classified according to its extent. Round foci of PVH surrounding the frontal and occipital horns of the lateral ventricles were observed in 4 infants (PVH pattern I). Continuous PVH was observed in 17 infants (PVH patterns II and III). Fourteen infants with continuous PVH had spastic diplegia or quadriplegia. Developmental delay was demonstrated in 15 infants with continuous PVH. No PVH pattern I infants had cerebral palsy; only 1 such infant had mild developmental delay. Our study suggests that the extent of PVH reflects the severity of brain damage in neonates with cerebral injuries. ",0
"Malignant melanoma of the biliary tract: a case report. A 58-year-old man was seen with obstructive jaundice and discomfort in the upper abdomen. Computed tomographic and ultrasound examinations revealed a soft-tissue mass in the gallbladder. Cholecystectomy and choledochotomy revealed a soft black mass in the gallbladder and a second one in the intrapancreatic portion of the common bile duct. Each was diagnosed as malignant melanoma. Subsequently, a Whipple resection of the pancreas, duodenum, and distal bile duct revealed a melanoma circumferentially invading and obstructing the distal common duct. No lymph node or distant metastasis was identified. Repetitive searches for another primary site have been negative. The tumor apparently originated in the biliary tract. The patient remains almost well 2 years after diagnosis. ",0
"Extensive peripheral retinectomy combined with posterior 360 degrees retinotomy for retinal reattachment in advanced proliferative vitreoretinopathy cases. Posterior 360 degrees retinotomy in conjunction with extensive peripheral retinectomy was necessary for retinal reattachment in 18 eyes. A visual acuity of 20/400 or better was achieved in 22% of the patients; in patients with rubeosis, regression was found in 89%. Of the hypotonus eyes, preoperatively 78% were normotensive postoperatively after removal of anterior proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) covering ciliary epithelium. The major intraoperative complication was hemorrhage, which could be readily controlled. Recurrent retinal detachment (RD) occurred in 39% and reproliferation in 50% of the patients. ",0
"Post-traumatic bile fistulae. Bile leakage after liver injury has been reported to be a complication associated with significant mortality. In a prospective study of 306 patients with liver injuries 13 (4%) developed a bile leak. There appear to be two groups of patients, those with a major bile duct injury (three patients) and those with a more peripheral injury (ten patients). Bile leaks may present either as bile peritonitis (six patients) or as a bile leak through a drain site (seven patients). All but one bile leak closed spontaneously at a median of 33 days (range, 3-110 days). There was no mortality but patients incurred a median of four complications each (range, 1-5). This may reflect the severity of the initial injury rather than the bile leak. Respiratory failure and/or infection and sepsis were the most common complications whilst abnormalities of liver function, although common, were seldom of clinical significance. ",0
"Absence of acetylcholine-induced current in epithelial cells from thymus glands and thymomas of myasthenia gravis patients. We investigated the activity of ion channels in epithelial cells from human thymus glands and thymomas kept in short-term cell culture by clamping the membrane potential of the cells at -85 mV and determining the membrane current flowing on application of acetylcholine, glycine, or gamma-aminobutyric acid. In concentrations of up to 10(-3) M, none of the neurotransmitters induced any detectable current. This suggests (1) that there are no acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) or other products of the AChR gene family having ion-channel properties in the membranes of these epithelial cells, and (2) that the alpha-bungarotoxin-binding protein of thymus and thymoma has no AChR-like ion-channel property. These results support the hypothesis that the cross-reacting structures that elicit the anti-AChR autoimmune response in thymoma-associated myasthenia gravis are antigens having only limited homology with the AChR. Myasthenia gravis not associated with thymoma might have a different pathogenesis. ",0
"Feasibility of reversing benzodiazepine tolerance with flumazenil To examine whether the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil can reverse tolerance to benzodiazepines but without precipitating withdrawal seizures, the antiepileptic effect of flumazenil itself and its ability to reverse tolerance at a dose that would leave sufficient receptors free for the binding of benzodiazepines were investigated. Electroencephalographic studies in 6 patients with partial and 6 with generalised seizures showed that flumazenil had a short (20 min) non-dose-dependent suppressant effect on epileptic discharges in those with partial seizures. Receptor occupancy studies in 12 patients showed that 1.5 mg flumazenil given intravenously occupied 55% receptors, whereas 15 mg occupied nearly all receptors. When 3 patients with partial seizures who had become tolerant to clonazepam were given 1.5 mg flumazenil, they were seizure-free for 6-21 days after the injection. The value of intermittent therapy with a benzodiazepine antagonist for preventing or reversing tolerance to benzodiazepine agonists ought to be investigated further. ",0
"Unusual presentation of recurrent Wegener's granulomatosis. A 65-year-old woman presented with recurrent Wegener's granulomatosis following two years of immunosuppressive therapy and three years of complete remission. At her initial presentation, she had a characteristic x-ray picture showing multiple nodules with total resolution of these findings at three months. Five years later, at the time of clinical relapse, her chest x-ray film showed bilateral diffuse infiltrative disease. This change in radiologic presentation upon relapse of Wegener's has not previously been reported. Other unusual features include diffuse infiltrates as the pulmonary presentation and the long interval between cessation of therapy and relapse. We review the radiologic manifestations of Wegener's granulomatosis. ",0
"Upper tract tumours following cystectomy for bladder cancer. Is routine intravenous urography worthwhile? The incidence and presentation of upper tract tumours were studied in 180 patients who had previously undergone cystectomy for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Intravenous urography was performed routinely 3 months after cystectomy, 1 year later and at 3-yearly intervals thereafter. Ten patients developed upper tract tumours; 1 presented with loin pain and the remainder with haematuria. Six patients underwent nephroureterectomy and 5 of them lived for at least 4 years; 4 were inoperable and only 1 survived longer than 6 months. In this series, all patients with upper tract tumours presented with symptoms and routine intravenous urography failed to detect any asymptomatic lesions. Routine radiological assessment of the upper tracts to detect tumours is not justified following cystectomy. ",0
"Detection by CT during arterial portography of colorectal cancer metastases to liver. A prospective evaluation of the accuracy of real-time ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT), infusion hepatic angiography (IHA), and computed tomography during arterial portography (CT-AP) was performed on 65 resected liver metastases of colorectal cancers. The total detection rate was 58.5 percent for US, 56.3 percent for CT, 55.4 percent for IHA, and 86.2 percent for CT-AP. The sensitivity of 29 lesions with diameters of smaller than 1 cm was 65.5 percent for CT-AP, CT found only two, and both US and IHA localized no more than three. The smallest lesions detectable by CT-AP were as small as 0.4 cm in diameter. CT-AP proved most useful in detecting the liver metastases, and the use of this technique is recommended for preoperative planning of hepatectomy on patients with liver metastases. ",0
"A case of cecocolic intussusception with complete invagination and intussusception of the appendix with villous adenoma. Villous adenoma of the appendix is a rare neoplasm and intussusception of the appendix is a rare pathologic condition. A very rare case seen in a 35-year-old male with pain in the right lateral abdomen is reported. In this patient, the appendix along with the villous adenoma intussuscepted and invaginated into the cecal lumen, and presented as cecocolic intussusception. A polypoid lesion was diagnosed in the cecum by fiberoptic colonoscopy. Unlike polypoid lesions at other sites in the large intestine, polypoid lesions of the cecum may accompany intussusception and invagination of the appendix. Consequently, caution is required in performing endoscopic polypectomy in cases of polypoid lesions of the cecum. ",0
"Solitary, isolated metastasis from Ewing's sarcoma to the brain: case report. We report a case of a 30-year-old woman who developed an intraparenchymal cerebral metastasis from a Ewing's sarcoma of the chest wall diagnosed and treated 3 years earlier and in apparent remission at the time of the neurological presentation (seizures). The case was complicated by a spontaneous preoperative intratumoral hemorrhage that occurred the morning of the scheduled surgical resection and caused a left dense hemiparesis. The tumor and the hematoma were removed. The patient improved after surgical intervention and a postoperative course of cranial irradiation followed by systemic chemotherapy was given. Nineteen months after treatment the patient remains disease-free from the clinical and radiological standpoint. ",0
"Neonatal small bowel atresia, stenosis and segmental dilatation. In 8 years, 44 neonates were treated for small bowel atresia, stenosis or segmental dilatation by one surgical team. There was a single lesion in 30 infants and 14 had two or more sites of intestinal obstruction. Associated gastrointestinal abnormalities were found in 23 (52 per cent) patients. Resection of the atresia(s) and primary anastomosis were performed in 34 infants and staged procedures were carried out in ten patients with complicated lesions. Patients undergoing staged procedures had a higher complication rate than those having primary repair (six out of ten and 11 out of 34 respectively). The overall initial survival rate was 93 per cent, rising to 100 per cent in those without associated anomalies or prenatal complications, but more than a quarter (27 per cent) of survivors have long-term disabilities.

"Anterior decompression and stabilization of thoracolumbar burst fractures by the use of the Slot-Zielke device. Between July 1983 and November 1986, 29 patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures underwent a one-stage operation consisting of anterior decompression by subtotal vertebrectomy, reduction, and stabilization with the Slot-Zielke device. The mean follow-up was 3.1 years. Most patients with incomplete neurologic lesions showed postoperative improvement and were upgraded one or two steps in the Frankel scale. No patient showed neurologic deterioration after surgery. In all patients, bony union occurred. Loss of reduction of more than 5 degrees occurred in 41% of the patients. Because of this high rate of loss of reduction in patients and the low degree of flexion-bending loading and torsional stability in biomechanical evaluation in vitro of the Slot-Zielke device on human cadaveric spines, an additional posterior stabilization of the spine after an anterior approach for anterior- and middle-column fractures should be considered.

"Catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy in multiple endocrine neoplasia. A histologic, ultrastructural, and biochemical study. A catecholamine-induced dilated cardiomyopathy is reported in a patient with multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 3. A histologic and ultrastructural study has been undertaken in cardiac biopsy samples, together with determination of myocardial Ca++ and cellular membrane fatty acids. Contraction band necrosis of cardiocytes with supercontraction of sarcomeres progressing to myofibrolysis and increased levels of myocardial Ca++ have been found as morphologic and biochemical abnormalities, respectively. No lipoperoxidation of cellular membranes or an alpha-adrenergic mediated reduction of coronary supply could be recognized in the study. We indicate a receptor-mediated intracellular Ca++ overload as the main abnormality responsible for myocardial impairment. ",0
"Spindle cell carcinoma of the lung. A clinicopathologic study of three cases. Two cases of monophasic spindle cell carcinomas and one case of adenosquamous carcinoma with the spindle cell component located in the lower respiratory tract are presented. In the biphasic tumor, areas of transition from carcinoma to sarcomatous spindle cells were clearly found. The two monophasic tumors and the spindle cell component of the biphasic tumor were histologically characterized by sheets of spindle cells. However, by electron microscopic and immunohistochemical study, several features of squamous epithelial differentiation were found in the spindle cell areas of all cases. Keratin and vimentin were, in various degrees, coexpressed in all the cases. Therefore, it is supposed that the spindle cell component displays a spectrum of phenotypes originating from squamous cell carcinoma, and monophasic spindle cell carcinoma is considered as a kind of the extreme phenotype of squamous cell carcinoma pretending mesenchymal differentiation.

"All-trans retinoic acid in acute promyelocytic leukemias. II. In vitro studies: structure-function relationship. All-trans retinoic acid induces leukemic cells from patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (M3) to differentiate in vitro to mature granulocytes which express the CD15 antigen and are capable of respiratory burst function. Of 35 M3 samples, only one failed to respond. In eight cases, we compared the efficacy of two naturally occurring isomers of retinoic acid, all-trans RA and 13-cis RA. Both isomers induce maximal differentiation at 10(-6) mol/L. The maximal response was maintained at 10(-7) mol/L for the all-trans but not for the 13-cis RA. We also observed that the metabolites 4-oxo-all-trans and 4-oxo-13-cis were effective at 10(-6) mol/L. This 1 order of magnitude difference in the in vitro differentiating potencies of all-trans RA and 13-cis RA in the blasts of promyelocytic leukemias predicts a difference in the clinical efficacy of the two drugs.

"Subtle cerebellar phenotype in mice homozygous for a targeted deletion of the En-2 homeobox. The two mouse genes, En-1 and En-2, that are homologs of the Drosophila segmentation gene engrailed, show overlapping spatially restricted patterns of expression in the neural tube during embryogenesis, suggestive of a role in regional specification. Mice homozygous for a targeted mutation that deletes the homeobox were viable and showed no obvious defects in embryonic development. This may be due to functional redundancy of En-2 and the related En-1 gene product during embryogenesis. Consistent with this hypothesis, the mutant mice showed abnormal foliation in the adult cerebellum, where En-2, and not En-1, is normally expressed. ",0
"Mechanical sutures in perforation of the thoracic esophagus as a safe procedure in patients seen late. Between 1976 and 1988, we treated 13 perforations of the thoracic esophagus, excluding ruptured carcinoma and intraoperative wounds, by mechanical sutures without exclusion. The delay between perforation and treatment ranged from eight to 168 hours, more than 24 hours in 11. The length of perforation was 0.5 to 15.0 centimeters. Suture was covered with a flap in ten instances; an antireflux procedure was associated with five instances. No digestive ostomies were performed. There was one death; a patient who was comatose upon arrival. The results of this small series suggest that myotomy exposing the mucosa and a flap are two essential elements of the technique; perforations of less than 6 centimeters, even when seen late, may be treated by primary surgical closure.

"Survey of Alabama physicians' use of mammography, 1989. In early 1989 we surveyed by questionnaire Alabama primary care physicians (N = 1800) concerning their attitudes toward and use of mammography. There were 681 respondents (37.8%). The majority (83%) recommend mammograms for their patients according to the American Cancer Society guidelines and obtain baseline studies in asymptomatic women between the ages of 35 and 40 years. It appears that the cost of mammograms is decreasing in Alabama; a screening study was available for $50 or less to 34% of responding physicians. Almost one half (48%) of the physician respondents believe that more than 50% of their patients have had at least one mammogram. ",0
"Basic studies on a new material for inducing antitumor immune cells. Recently, adoptive immunotherapy for cancer with lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells has been widely used experimentally. The therapy has several problems, including difficulty in handling, sterilization, and time consumption. To solve these problems, new materials able to induce antitumor immune cells were investigated. Pokeweed mitogen (PWM) and PWM-conjugated materials (CMC-1) could induce strong killer cells by short-term stimulation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). The induced killer cells showed a wide killing spectrum in vitro against human tumor cell lines (MKK-1, PRMI4788, NBT-2, ZR-7530, H-1, Hela, KB, HMV-1, PC-10, C-1). Human PBL stimulated for a short time by CMC-1 also showed a tumoricidal effect on tumor bearing (MKN-1, MKN-45) nude mice. These results suggest that CMC-1 may solve the problems with currently used LAK therapy and may provide easily applicable extracorporeal immunotherapy for cancer. ",0
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy in invasive bladder cancer: the evolving role of surgery. The role of an operation in patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy for clinically localized but invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder currently is evolving. An operation is essential for case selection and evaluation of local response but it also contributes to bladder preservation and survival. The procedure that is necessary to select for and assess response to chemotherapy may itself alter the actual or proceed to evolution of invasive bladder cancer. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a reasonable therapeutic strategy in selected patients but it remains to be seen whether the results will prove to be superior to those achieved with standard endoscopic and open operations. ,0
"The management of atypical non-cardiac chest pain. Atypical, non-cardiac chest pain is common and disabling, and often persists despite negative medical investigations. Aetiology is disputed and management is difficult. A multi-causal model in which both psychological and physical factors play a part is helpful; a fundamental factor is continued misinterpretation of minor physical symptoms as evidence of heart disease. We report supportive evidence and describe a psychological treatment derived from the model. In a randomized trial, cognitive behavioural methods were effective in reducing chest pain, disability and use of medication, in patients both with and without psychiatric disorder. The clinical implications are discussed. ",0
"Management of Peyronie disease by implantation of inflatable penile prosthesis. Sixty-seven patients with advanced Peyronie disease were treated by implantation of an inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP). Twenty-eight of the 67 patients had documented total erectile failure. The remaining 39 patients had significant penile curvature causing ""mechanical impotence"" due to inability to achieve adequate vaginal penetration and chose implantation of an inflatable penile prosthesis (in some cases, combined with a straightening procedure) rather than one of the standard penile straightening procedures. Currently, 63 of the 67 patients have functioning prosthetic devices; in 3 other patients the device was removed because of infection, and 1 patient was dissatisfied and had the device removed. For impotent patients with severe Peyronie disease for whom other medical or surgical treatment is neither desirable nor suitable, we recommend implantation of an inflatable penile prosthesis combined with a possible straightening procedure.

"Estrogen and coronary heart disease in women. We review herein the evidence that estrogen is protective against the development of cardiovascular disease in women. To our knowledge, no studies in women have looked at endogenous estrogen levels as predictors of cardiovascular disease. Studies of surrogate measures of endogenous estrogen such as parity, age at menarche, and age at menopause have provided inconsistent results. Current use of oral contraceptives increases risk in older women who smoke cigarettes, but most studies of past use show no increased risk. Most, but not all, studies of hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women show around a 50% reduction in risk of a coronary event in women using unopposed oral estrogen. These important observations need to be confirmed in a double-blind, randomized clinical trial, since the protection is biologically plausible and the magnitude of the benefit would be quite large if selection factors can be excluded.

"Long term effects of gastrocystoplasty in rats. Twenty prepubescent rats underwent microsurgical gastrocystoplasty by a technique which is described. An equal number of control rats had their bladders opened and closed. Rats were sacrificed at 16 to 18 months postoperatively. There were no differences in final weight, serum electrolytes, or renal function between the two groups. Prominent histopathologic changes of the bladder occurred in the gastrocystoplasty group. These changes included papillomas present in five of the 15 rats surviving long term. No significant changes occurred in the bladders of the control group of rats. Possible etiologies and the significance of the rats. Possible etiologies and the significance of the gastrocystoplasty related lesions are discussed. ",0
"Implementation of preventive services in an HMO practice. Practice does not conform to guidelines unless the guidelines are specifically implemented and performance is monitored. Several examples of implementation in one health maintenance organization (HMO) are given. These include immunization for influenza and follow up of positive screening tests for colorectal and cervical cancer. Each implementation effort has required the development of systems, which in this HMO are automated. Several issues influencing implementation are discussed, including resource constraints and priorities for the allocation of new resources. Developers cannot expect that their guidelines will be incorporated into clinical practice. They must foster specific implementation plans. ",0
"Social networks, health, and emotional well-being among the oldest old in London. A survey of the health and social circumstances of 662 people aged 85 and over, living at home in inner London, was conducted in 1987. A primary aim was to analyze the structure of social support networks of the sample in relation to respondents' emotional well-being and met and unmet needs for practical help. The conceptual and methodological framework that was applied to the study was derived from the theory of social networks. In confirmation of the common assumption that people aged 85+ are different from younger elderly people, as they are the ""survivors,"" high levels of social support and informal help were given to most respondents. Although associations were found between social network variables and the provision of informal help, multifactorial analysis showed that health status explained more of the variation in emotional well-being.

"Magnetic resonance imaging in the preoperative evaluation of cervical radiculopathy. Forty patients with cervical radiculopathy were examined preoperatively with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI was used alone in 27 (68%) of the 40 patients; the remainder also had computed tomography in conjunction with myelography. The primary criterion on MRI for a clinically significant lesion was asymmetrical narrowing of the subarachnoid space in the region of the nerve root. Surgical confirmation of the abnormality was obtained in all 40 cases. The operative findings were a herniated nucleus pulposus (32 of 40 patients), spondylosis (2 of 40 patients), or a combination of the two (6 of 40 patients). MRI identified a surgical lesion (herniated nucleus pulposus, spondylosis, or both) in 37 of the 40 (92%) patients. We think MRI is the only preoperative imaging examination necessary in most cases of cervical radiculopathy. ",0
"Severe hypertension after liver transplantation in alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency. Five children with alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency and terminal liver disease received liver grafts; all five became hypertensive and four developed hypertensive encephalopathy. There was evidence of renal disease preoperatively and renal biopsy specimens showed variable glomerulonephritic histology with IgA nephropathy in one, mesangial-proliferative changes in two, and mesangio-capillary glomerulonephritis type I in two. Four hypertensive episodes were preceded by a fall in creatinine clearance. The association of glomerulonephritis with alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency in children is more common than has been recognised. Affected patients are prone to severe hypertension of probable renal origin after liver transplantation and the renal lesion may affect long term prognosis. ",0
"Combined laminoplasty and posterolateral fusion for spinal canal surgery in children and adolescents. Spinal deformities, especially kyphosis and instability, after laminectomy for tumors and other diseases, are major clinical problems. Since 1981, combined laminoplasty and posterolateral fusion for the prevention of postlaminectomy spinal deformities was performed on eight male and two female patients aged two to 26 years (average, 13.9 years). The follow-up period was from six months to seven years and three months (average, three years and five months). Two patients died six and ten months postoperatively because of brain metastases (astrocytoma) and lung metastases (neuroblastoma), respectively. Good alignment with no instability of the cervical or thoracic spine was obtained for all patients, including the two who died. Laminoplasty combined with posterolateral fusion was found to be very effective in preventing the development of spinal deformities after spinal canal surgery for spinal cord tumors or other diseases in children and adolescents.

Isolated systolic hypertension in the elderly: an epidemiologic review. Isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) is usually defined as a systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure less than 90 or 95 mm Hg. Systolic blood pressure has been found to increase with age in most populations studied and thus the prevalence of ISH can be expected to increase with age. ISH is more prevalent in elderly women than in elderly men. Estimates of the prevalence of ISH vary according to its definition and the number of blood pressure measurements. There is evidence that the prevalence of ISH is decreasing. Results of a survey of the prevalence of ISH in 11 countries are presented; the estimates among men aged 60 to 69 years ranged from 1% in Israel to 24% in Norway. Only a prospective standardized survey conducted in several countries will reveal the true prevalence of ISH. ,0
"Successful treatment of metastatic thymic carcinoma with cisplatin, vinblastine, bleomycin, and etoposide chemotherapy. Thymic carcinomas are rare malignant neoplasms of the thymic epithelium that are distinguished from the malignant thymomas by the presence of cytologic atypia. Thymic carcinomas may metastasize outside of the thorax and are associated with a very poor prognosis. Complete responses of thymic carcinoma to chemotherapy alone have not been reported. A 21-year-old man with metastatic undifferentiated carcinoma of probable thymic origin is presented who achieved a pathologic complete response with cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin chemotherapy. Additional consolidative chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide was administered. The patient remains disease-free 5 years after diagnosis. Cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin chemotherapy appears to have significant activity against thymic carcinoma. ",0
"Visual evoked potentials and visual prognosis following perinatal asphyxia. Twenty-five children born at term with perinatal asphyxia were studied at age 2.5 to 4.5 years to evaluate visual function and to determine the prognostic value of postnatal assessments of visual outcome. Postnatal assessments included several visual evoked potentials and electroretinograms in the first week of life. Follow-up assessments included flash and pattern visual evoked potentials, visual evoked potential threshold measurements, and clinical eye examinations. Nineteen children had normal visual function, three were visually impaired, and three remained blind. A strong association was found between normal, abnormal, or absent visual evoked potentials in the early postnatal period and long-term visual outcome (P less than .0001). Other perinatal indicators of asphyxia, including neurologic status, Apgar scores, and arterial pH values, were poor predictors of visual outcome. The risk of visual impairment was limited to those survivors with neurodevelopmental deficits. ",0
"Langerhans cell histiocytosis in monozygotic twins. Langerhans cells histiocytosis, one of a group of histiocytosis syndromes characterized by Langerhans cell infiltration, has many clinical manifestations. In the past 30 years, numerous cases of presumed Letterer-Siwe disease, the acute multiorgan variant, have been reported in twins and siblings. Only recently has the Histiocyte Society established a criterion for a ""definitive diagnosis"" of Langerhans cell histiocytosis--the presence of Birbeck granules within the cells of the histiocytic infiltrate. We report the fatal outcome of Langerhans cell histiocytosis in monozygotic twin infants. There is no satisfactory explanation why Langerhans cell histiocytosis occurs concurrently in twins. We suggest that cytokines may provide an endogenous signal that triggers the pathologic proliferation of Langerhans cells. ",0
"Genetic mechanisms of tumor suppression by the human p53 gene. Mutations of the gene encoding p53, a 53-kilodalton cellular protein, are found frequently in human tumor cells, suggesting a crucial role for this gene in human oncogenesis. To model the stepwise mutation or loss of both p53 alleles during tumorigenesis, a human osteosarcoma cell line, Saos-2, was used that completely lacked endogenous p53. Single copies of exogenous p53 genes were then introduced by infecting cells with recombinant retroviruses containing either point-mutated or wild-type versions of the p53 cDNA sequence. Expression of wild-type p53 suppressed the neoplastic phenotype of Saos-2 cells, whereas expression of mutated p53 conferred a limited growth advantage to cells in the absence of wild-type p53. Wild-type p53 was phenotypically dominant to mutated p53 in a two-allele configuration. These results suggest that, as with the retinoblastoma gene, mutation of both alleles of the p53 gene is essential for its role in oncogenesis. ",0
"Simian virus 40 small tumor antigen and an amino-terminal domain of large tumor antigen share a common transforming function. The 82-residue amino-terminal sequences of simian virus 40 large tumor antigen (TAg) and small tumor antigen (tAg) are identical. Genetic analysis of TAg lacking amino acids 1-82 revealed that it was transformation-defective, as revealed by the agar growth assay, except when introduced in the presence of tAg. Since the latter, alone, lacks overt transforming activity, it would appear that the function of the sequence common to TAg and tAg is necessary, but not sufficient, for TAg transforming activity and that tAg can provide that function or its equivalent in trans. Thus, tAg may, in part, be viewed as a ""portable"" copy of a TAg functional domain. ",0
"Measurement of acute phase proteins for assessing severity of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Seventeen adult patients with acute Plasmodium falciparum malaria, admitted to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, were studied. Serial measurements of the serum concentration of C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A protein, and percentage parasitaemia were determined, together with initial measurement of serum electrolytes, liver function, haemoglobin, white cell and platelet counts. Initial C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A concentrations were increased (C-reactive protein mean 49.0 mg/l serum amyloid A 28 mg/l) falling towards the normal range by the seventh day of treatment. There was a significant correlation between the pretreatment parasite count and clinical and laboratory markers of inflammation. C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A concentrations correlated inversely with the serum sodium. These results indicate that measurement of acute phase reactants such as C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A may prove valuable in assessing the severity of P falciparum malaria, and in following the response to antimalarial treatment.

"Measuring crackles. Crackles heard on auscultation can be represented graphically as a time-amplitude plot of the associated waveform. To assess the relative merits of several measures which might be considered for machine implementation in diagnostic instruments, we compared the reproducibility of those based on the initial voltage deflection which begins a crackle with those based on the largest deflection. The latter group showed less interobserver and less intraobserver variability when the same crackles were measured twice by each of two observers. Crackles from a teaching tape, categorized as fine and coarse, were used in this study. The ability of the various measures tested to distinguish between fine and coarse crackles on an individual basis was assessed and found to favor the measures based on the largest deflection. They showed an average of 9.96 percent incorrectly classified crackles, as opposed to 19.53 percent for the two measures based on the initial deflection. ",0
"Results of transsphenoidal extirpation of craniopharyngiomas and Rathke's cysts. Fourteen patients undergoing transsphenoidal extirpation of craniopharyngiomas or Rathke's cysts underwent endocrinological evaluation before and after surgery. One patient died during the procedure because of uncontrollable arterial bleeding. The other patients were followed for up to 16 years (average, 8.5 years). One patient had recurrence of tumor 12 years after surgery. Another patient, the only one operated on because of a recurrent craniopharyngioma after previous radiation therapy, died 2 years after the transsphenoidal operation. No patient recovered pituitary functions that had been lost before surgery. One patient, who had an isolated growth hormone deficiency, and another, who had panhypopituitarism with sustained antidiuretic hormone secretion, had no change postoperatively from their preoperative endocrine status. The other 11 patients lost pituitary function and required pharmacological replacement of one to four pituitary hormones. ",0
"Constipation: pathophysiology and treatment. Although many physicians consider constipation a trivial problem, it is one of the most frequent and chronic digestive disorders in the United States, affecting 4.53 million people and causing considerable morbidity. More than $200 million are spent for over-the-counter laxatives and untold millions of dollars are spent for prescription drugs and other medical services to manage this disorder. Successful management requires an appreciation of the magnitude of the problem, an understanding of colorectal function and a clear assessment of the causes. Careful examination of the patient's anorectal anatomy and improvement in the patient's dietary habits are the first steps in management. Therapeutic options include behavioral modification strategies, diet and lifestyle changes, pharmacologic therapy and, rarely, surgical intervention. ",0
"The electrocardiographic manifestations of cyclic antidepressant therapy and overdose: a review. Cyclic antidepressants may cause changes in the electrocardiogram at therapeutic or toxic serum levels. The most serious complications of cyclic antidepressant toxicity are dysrhythmias, hypotension, and seizures. It is predominantly the cardiotoxic effects that cause mortality. Once cardiotoxicity is evident, the treatment of choice is serum alkalinization, preferably by sodium bicarbonate therapy. In order to predict which overdose patients are at high risk for complications, electrocardiographic criteria have been identified as reliable screens. For ""first generation"" tricyclic antidepressants, QRS prolongation (particularly greater than 100 msec) and a terminal 40-ms frontal plane axis greater than 120 degrees are the most sensitive. This article reviews antidepressant pharmacology, electrocardiographic manifestations of antidepressant cardiotoxicity, and approaches to treatment of antidepressant-induced conduction disturbances and dysrhythmias.

"Gonococcal endocarditis: twenty-five year experience. Gonococcal endocarditis is a devastating albeit rare complication of disseminated gonorrhea. It virtually disappeared as a disease entity with the advent of antibiotic therapy. Recently, it has reappeared with surprisingly high frequency for unclear reasons. Since 1983, the authors have observed six episodes of this disease in five patients, the largest series reported to date. It is predominantly a disease of young people without underlying valvular heart disease. Characteristic clinical features include a high frequency of congestive heart failure and nephritis and a proclivity for aortic valve involvement, commonly with associated ring abscess, and large vegetations. Genitourinary symptoms, arthralgias, and rash are uncommon. Previously undescribed features include involvement of all four valves simultaneously, recurrence on an aortic valve prosthesis, and a high frequency of terminal complement deficiencies. Precipitous hemodynamic deterioration despite appropriate therapy is not uncommon, and overall mortality rate remains an alarming 19%. ",0
"A study of fatigue in systemic lupus erythematosus. Fifty-nine patients with systemic lupus erythematosus were evaluated by questionnaires, histories, physical examinations and routine laboratory studies in order to better understand their fatigue. The fatigue severity scale (scored from 1 to 7) was used to measure fatigue and yielded a mean score +/- SD of 4.6 +/- 1.5. Fifty-three percent of the patients reported that fatigue was their most disabling symptom. Although perceived as severe, the symptom of fatigue did not correlate significantly with any of the laboratory measures. However, there was a significant correlation between fatigue and the physician's rating of disease activity. Fatigue also correlated significantly with depression which accounted for 21% of the variation in fatigue scores. ",0
"Primary malignant melanoma in the parotid gland. Reports of primary malignant melanoma arising from the parotid salivary gland are extremely rare and, to date, have been sporadic. We report a pertinent case, and tabulate and correlate the clinical findings of the 13 cases reported thus far in the literature. The most common symptom is a progressively enlarging, asymptomatic, firm, and fixed mass. Total excision has been the established treatment of choice. The contribution of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy remains unclear, and it is not possible at present to predict the outcome of treatment in individual patients. Although rare, primary malignant melanoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of parotid tumors. The clinical significance of establishing the diagnosis of primary malignant melanoma of the parotid gland is emphasized. ",0
"Cervical rotation flaps for midface resurfacing. The midface has long served as a focus for creativity in surgical reconstruction. Full-thickness skin grafts, split-thickness grafts, and distal flaps have long been used to attempt to reduplicate existing anatomy in this area. Recent reconstruction efforts have focused on the creative use of microvascular free flaps for this purpose. This article reports on the use of extensively developed regional rotation flaps as an excellent reconstructive modality for use in this area of the face. The details of surgical incisional planning are given. The nuances of surgical creation of these flaps and their rotation and suspension into place are given. The cases we have done using this technique for the past 3 years are reviewed. Our present indications for use of these flaps and their limitations are given. ",0
"Mapping of the locus for X-linked cardioskeletal myopathy with neutropenia and abnormal mitochondria (Barth syndrome) to Xq28. X-linked cardioskeletal myopathy with neutropenia and abnormal mitochondria is clinically characterized by congenital dilated cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, recurrent bacterial infections, and growth retardation. We analyzed linkage between the disease locus and X-chromosomal markers in a family with seven carriers, four patients, and eight unaffected sons of carriers. Highest lod scores obtained by two-point linkage analysis were 2.70 for St14.1 (DXS52, TaqI) at a recombination fraction of zero and 2.53 for cpX67 (DXS134) at a recombination fraction of zero. Multipoint linkage analysis resulted in a maximum lod score of 5.24 at the position of St35.691 (DXS305). The most distal recombination detected in this family was located between the markers II-10 (DXS466) and DX13 (DXS15). These data indicate the location of the mutated gene at Xq28. ",0
"Comparison of the conventional method of lymph node staging with a comprehensive fat-clearing method for gastric adenocarcinoma. Discrepant results in long-term survival between United States and Japanese patients with resectable gastric adenocarcinoma may result from more accurate staging in the Japanese series. The authors compared a comprehensive fat-clearing method with the conventional pathology method of lymph node sampling in 11 patients undergoing curative gastrectomy and extended lymphadenectomy at their institution. Comprehensive fat-clearing doubled total lymph node counts (P less than 0.01), identified smaller lymph nodes (P less than 0.001), and identified more histologically involved nodes of significantly smaller size (P less than 0.001). Comprehensive fat-clearing pathologically upstaged 29% of the authors' eligible specimens. Accurate pathologic staging is necessary when comparing Japanese and United States survival data for resectable gastric adenocarcinomas. ",0
"Fenestrated atrial septal aneurysm: diagnosis by transesophageal echocardiography. The diagnosis of atrial septal defect by transthoracic echocardiography remains difficult in a small subset of patients because of either suboptimal acoustic windows or unusual anatomy, for example, fenestrated defects. We report the case of a 55-year-old woman with a fenestrated atrial septal aneurysm that was incompletely visualized by transthoracic echocardiography. Subsequent transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated three defects within the atrial septal aneurysm with left-to-right shunting across each defect. Normal pulmonary venous connections were also defined. All echocardiographic findings were confirmed at surgery. This case demonstrates the additional diagnostic accuracy of transesophageal echocardiography for detecting disease of the atrial septum. ",0
"Impact of nonoperative therapy on the clinical management of peripheral arterial disease. Nonoperative therapy includes conservative noninterventional modalities and the endovascular interventional modalities of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and a variety of laser systems and atherectomy devices. The role and impact of all nonoperative treatments are considered in the perspectives of the natural history of lower-extremity arteriosclerosis and its present surgical (operative) treatment. Nonoperative treatments may replace and/or facilitate surgical treatment in operative candidates. Nonoperative methods may also justify treatment in patients who cannot or should not be subjected to surgery. Facts and opinions relating to these uses of nonoperative treatments are presented, and the qualifications and credentialing of individuals who should be treating patients with lower-extremity ischemia resulting from peripheral arteriosclerosis are discussed.

"The current spectrum of peptic ulcer disease in the older age groups. Not only has there been a relative increase in the prevalence of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) among America's older age groups, but the characteristics of PUD in these patients differ significantly from those of the general population. Seventy-two consecutive patients 60 years of age or older who underwent operation for PUD between 1984 and 1989 were studied. The unusual features in these patients were 1) 92 per cent required emergency operation, 2) 57 per cent with perforated PUD were female, 3) 85 per cent had duodenal pathology, 4) 28 per cent were currently taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and 5) over one half of all patients had serious postoperative complications. The increasing incidence and associated serious complications of PUD in the elderly population present new challenges to physicians in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. ",0
"Bone weakness after the removal of plates and screws. Cortical atrophy or screw holes? Bone weakness leading to refracture is a recognised complication of the removal of rigid fixation plates. We have used partially demineralised rabbit tibiae to simulate atrophic changes and to determine whether weakness is due to atrophy or to residual screw holes. Partial demineralisation and a screw hole each reduced maximum bending moment. However, energy absorbing capacity was little affected by demineralisation, but was reduced to 50% by a single drill hole. Residual screw holes are a considerably more important cause of bone weakness after plate removal than is cortical atrophy. ",0
"Congenital demyelinating motor and sensory neuropathy with focally folded myelin sheaths. Six patients (5 index cases and 1 sib) with a congenital motor and sensory neuropathy are described. The clinical, genetic and electrophysiological features resembled Dejerine-Sottas disease or hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN) type III. Sural nerve biopsy of 5 patients revealed segmental demyelination and remyelination with hypertrophic changes, although onion bulbs were not as ubiquitous as in classical HMSN type III. A striking discriminating feature from HMSN type III was an abundance of focal myelin thickenings (tomacula) present in nearly all teased fibres. Possible pathogenic implications are discussed. These cases corroborate the heterogeneity of congenital motor and sensory neuropathies. ",0
"Vaginosonographic measurement of endometrial thickness in the evaluation of amenorrhea. The progestin-induced withdrawal bleeding test has often been used in patients with amenorrhea to assess endogenous estrogen (E) production. The endometrial thickness measured by vaginal ultrasonography with a 5 MHz transducer is also dependent on E stimulation of the endometrium. In this study, 70 consecutive patients were evaluated with both the progestin-induced withdrawal bleeding test and a measurement of the endometrial thickness by vaginosonography. An endometrial thickness of 1.5 mm or less was selected to predict absence of bleeding after a progesterone (P) challenge test. This resulted in a sensitivity of 94% with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.70 to 1.00 and a specificity of 93% with a 95% CI of 0.82 and 0.98. The positive and negative predictive values were 79% and 98%, respectively. This study shows that the endometrial thickness measured by vaginosonography can predict the results of the P challenge test in patients with amenorrhea. ",0
"Intracranial pressure in African children with cerebral malaria Opening lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure was measured with a paediatric spinal fluid manometer in 26 of 61 Kenyan children (mean age 39 months) with cerebral malaria. In all cases pressure was above normal (mean [SD]22.6 [7.4] cm CSF, range 10.5-36). Clinical features of our patients suggest that intracranial hypertension is important in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria in children, especially as a cause of death. We suggest that raised intracranial pressure is secondary to increased cerebral blood volume. Lowering intracranial pressure may significantly reduce the mortality and morbidity of cerebral malaria. The potential risks and benefits of lumbar puncture should be considered carefully in patients with suspected cerebral malaria. ",0
"General assay for phosphoproteins in cerebrospinal fluid: a candidate marker for paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. The components of protein phosphorylation systems (protein kinases, protein phosphatases, and their phosphoprotein substrates) are highly enriched in neuronal cells compared with other cell types. We exploited this relative neuronal enrichment of protein phosphorylation system components to develop a general assay technique for putative protein kinase substrates (phosphoproteins) in human cerebrospinal fluid. Using this cerebrospinal fluid phosphoprotein assay, we have detected a putative protein kinase C substrate protein of apparent Mr 60 kd in 6 of 14 patients with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration but not in any of 55 patients with a variety of other neurological diseases. Phosphoproteins in cerebrospinal fluid may provide novel and unique markers for the diagnosis or staging of neuronal diseases as well as offer potential insights into the biochemical characterization of affected neuronal populations.

"Proximal gastric vagotomy: follow-up at 10-20 years. From August 1969 to December 1989, 600 patients had elective proximal gastric vagotomy for duodenal ulceration with an operative mortality of 0.2 per cent. Of these, 372 patients had surgery over 10 years ago. Three hundred and forty-two patients survived for more than 10 years and, in a prospective study, 305 were reviewed, forming the basis of this 10-20-year follow-up report. Forty-six (15 per cent) have had recurrent ulceration; 80 per cent of these developed symptoms within 5 years and no patient has had recurrence after 13 years. Although 29 patients required reoperation for recurrent ulceration, the current patient satisfaction rate for Visick grades I and II is 92 per cent. Only two patients required reoperation because of gastric stasis. It is concluded that proximal gastric vagotomy is a safe and satisfactory first choice operation for duodenal ulceration. ",0
"Temporal bone findings in two cases of head injury. Temporal bone findings in two cases of head injury are reported. In one patient, longitudinal fractures occurred in both temporal bones, and extended to the middle ear bilaterally. Bleeding was seen in the tympanic cavity, mastoid air cells, internal auditory meatus and facial nerve canal. Bleeding was observed in the scala tympani, cochlear aqueduct and endolymphatic sac, but there were no fractures. In the other patient, bleeding was seen in the internal auditory meatus and facial nerve canal. In the right ear, endolymphatic hydrops was observed in all turns of the cochlea. ",0
"Efficacy and safety of vagus nerve stimulation in patients with complex partial seizures. A clinical trial of chronic intermittent vagal stimulation in five patients suggests that the procedure may be safe and effective as adjunctive treatment of medically intractable seizures of partial onset. Patients tolerated well the implantation of the neurocybernetic prosthesis and the vagal stimulation without serious physiological or lifestyle changes. Stimulation of the vagus nerve either reduced the seizure frequency or decreased the duration or intensity of seizures. Adverse side effects were limited to a tingling sensation in the throat and hoarseness during stimulation. A major complication was mechanical interruption of the wire-electrode circuitry, with consequent cessation of stimulation. The small number of patients and the relatively short follow-up period make this a pilot study, but the results are promising. ",0
"Unusual cause of 'piriformis muscle syndrome'. The piriformis muscle syndrome is a controversial ""clinical"" syndrome primarily characterized by signs and symptoms of sciatic nerve compression at the region of the piriformis muscle as it passes through the greater sciatic notch. The syndrome is often referred to; however, cases are rarely reported, and it is generally an uncommon diagnosis. Of those cases reported, the incidence is six times more frequent in females than in males, and is typically temporally related to minor pelvic or buttock trauma. We describe a case of a 40-year-old woman presenting with signs and symptoms suggestive of piriformis muscle syndrome following a gynecologic procedure performed in the dorsal lithotomy position. Electromyographic findings were consistent with this clinical entity. Operative exploration, however, revealed the source of neural compression to be a pseudoaneurysm of the inferior gluteal artery adjacent to the piriformis muscle. The diagnostic features of this clinical syndrome are discussed. ",0
"Autopsy-documented cure of multiple myeloma 14 years after M2 chemotherapy. Multiple myeloma was diagnosed in a 65-year-old woman in 1974 who thereafter received five-drug M2 chemotherapy. All protein abnormalities subsequently returned to normal and serial bone marrow studies documented complete bone marrow remission. Destructive bone lesions persisted radiographically, but did not progress. In 1987, a localized sigmoid adenocarcinoma was resected. In 1988, the patient presented with multiple brain metastases associated with a primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma that proved rapidly fatal. At autopsy, no evidence of multiple myeloma was found. This report describes the first tissue-documented cure of multiple myeloma 14 years after diagnosis and initiation of M2 chemotherapy. The possible association of multiple myeloma with other malignancies is also discussed. ",0
"Toxoplasmic chorioretinitis and hepatic granulomas. A 71-yr-old male presented with a 2-month history of fever, malaise, and weight loss. Physical exam revealed chorioretinitis. Laboratory studies were notable for elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, aspartate transaminase, and alanine transaminase. Immunoglobulin G antibody to Toxoplasma gondii was positive to a dilution of 1:4096, whereas serologic studies for hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, human immunodeficiency virus, Brucella, and Tularemia were negative. A percutaneous biopsy of the liver revealed hepatic granulomas. Culture of the biopsy specimen was negative for growth of mycobacteria or fungi. Spontaneous improvement in clinical and laboratory parameters occurred over a 4-month period. ",0
"Spontaneous necrosis in osteosarcoma. The percentage of necrosis in a primary osteosarcoma after the patient has received preoperative chemotherapy is prognostic and is usually used to select subsequent chemotherapy. However, the percentage of necrosis that occurs spontaneously, without preoperative chemotherapy, has not been adequately studied. The examination of histologic macrosections of 76 osteosarcomas from patients who had not received preoperative treatment and of 20 patients who had received preoperative chemotherapy revealed a significant difference in the percentage of necrosis. There was minimal spontaneous necrosis, but necrosis after preoperative chemotherapy was usually extensive. The larger the tumor, the greater the percentage of spontaneous necrosis; however, size did not correlate with the percentage of necrosis with preoperative chemotherapy. Survival among those patients who did not receive preoperative treatment correlated with the size and percentage of necrosis. Necrosis in an osteosarcoma in a patient who has received preoperative chemotherapy can be considered the result of chemotherapy and not a spontaneous event. ",0
"Fatal sepsis following intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin administration for bladder cancer. Intravesical administration of bacillus Calmette-Guerin has been shown to be highly effective treatment of superficial bladder cancer. Complications from bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy are usually minor but serious and even fatal reactions can occur. Five recent cases illustrate the gravity of bacillus Calmette-Guerin sepsis. One man with severe debility and the organic brain syndrome died acutely with a fever of 40 C. Two men had frank sepsis that progressed to multiorgan failure and death. Sepsis progressed despite the use of isoniazid, rifampin and streptomycin. Two men who had equally progressive sepsis with intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin survived with the use of cycloserine for the first 72 hours of treatment. Triple antituberculous antibiotics, including cycloserine, may be lifesaving. Sepsis resulted from intravenous absorption through inflamed or disrupted urothelium. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin treatment should not be administered in the presence of severe cystitis or after grossly traumatic catheterization. ",0
"Tryptophan-induced eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome Eight patients who became ill while taking tryptophan had myalgia, fatigue, rash, fever, edema, alopecia, arthralgias, diminished joint motion, skin tightening, muscle cramping, and distal paresthesias. Three had shortness of breath, and one had pulmonary hypertension. Laboratory abnormalities included peripheral eosinophilia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and elevated serum levels of aldolase, lactate dehydrogenase, and liver enzymes. Of 4 chest radiographs, 3 were abnormal. Of 5 skin and muscle biopsies, 4 showed sclerosis or mixed inflammatory cell infiltration of the dermis, subcutis, and fascia. Eosinophils were often present, but vasculitis was absent. Muscle inflammation was minimal. We conclude that the ""eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome"" is related to the ingestion of tryptophan and that abnormalities in the secretion of lymphokines may be important in its pathogenesis. ",0
"Abscess of the iliopsoas muscle diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography. We have reported a case of abscess of the iliopsoas muscle, in which a limp and hip pain pointed toward pathology of the hip. The diagnosis in such cases may be difficult unless there is close attention to the clinical history and a good physical examination is obtained. One ultrasonographic examination of the hip in such a patient, subtle differences between the iliopsoas muscles should alert the radiologist to examine the psoas muscle. Ultrasonography is instrumental in demonstrating the solid or cystic nature of the iliopsoas mass, while MRI depicts the extent and proximity of adjacent organs. Once an iliopsoas abscess is diagnosed, treatment includes parenteral antibiotics and drainage. ",0
"Disseminated Pneumocystis carinii infection with hepatic involvement in a patient with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Extrapulmonary infection with Pneumocystis carinii (P. carinii) in AIDS patients is uncommon, and is often described only at postmortem examination. Although most antemortem cases involve spread to the bone marrow or spleen, P. carinii involvement of other organs has only recently been described. Despite the frequency of liver enzyme abnormalities in AIDS patients with a history of P. carinii pneumonia, P. carinii has been observed only rarely in the liver. We present a well-documented case of P. carinii involving the liver in an AIDS patient with P. carinii pneumonia and progressive liver enzyme abnormalities. We suggest that P. carinii infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of AIDS-related liver disease. ",0
"Wellness motivation in cardiac rehabilitation. Lack of patient adherence to prescribed regimens is a fundamental problem in cardiac rehabilitation programs. A causative factor in lack of patient adherence may be related to failure to address differences in individual health behavior motivation in cardiac rehabilitation. A group of 52 patients who had had myocardial infarction were sampled to test the relationship between social support systems, health locus of control, health value orientations, and wellness motivation. Pearson correlation coefficients indicated significant positive correlations between health locus of control variables, health value orientation variations, and wellness motivation. Health locus of control and health value orientation variables entered into a multiple regression equation to explain 32% of the variation in wellness motivation. Awareness of individual motivational responses that influence health behaviors in cardiac rehabilitation may enable nurses to develop intervention strategies for patients with cardiovascular disease who would benefit from modifying their risk-producing life-styles.

"Cardiopulmonary assessment in beta-thalassemia major. Thalassemia patients succumb at a young age to congestive heart failure. Hitherto, attention has been focused on left ventricular function. This report emphasizes right ventricular dysfunction and abnormal pulmonary function. We performed cardiopulmonary evaluation, including echo-Doppler, spirometry, CO diffusion (DCO), and blood gas analyses in 35 patients with homozygous beta-thalassemia maintained by multiple blood transfusions. Six autopsy lung specimens were studied. Thalassemia patients exhibited pulmonary dysfunction, characterized by hypoxemia (85 percent of the patients were outside the 95 percent confidence limits), reduced lung volumes (51 percent), flow rates (63 percent) and DCO (50 percent). Right ventricular dysfunction was more prevalent than left ventricular dysfunction. Furthermore, 75 percent of the patients had evidence of pulmonary hypertension consistent with more frequent right ventricular rather than left ventricular dysfunction. Our findings suggest that in thalassemia patients, complex cardiopulmonary abnormalities precede the final outcome of congestive heart failure. ",0
"Improved postoperative course after spinous process segmental instrumentation of thoracolumbar fractures. This article compares the postoperative course of 40 patients who had Harrington instrumentation with 40 patients who had Harrington instrumentation and interspinous process segmental instrumentation of unstable thoracolumbar fractures and reviews the findings. The two groups of patients were otherwise homogeneous, and average operative time, total blood loss, and days to oral intake were similar for both groups of patients. On average, however, patients undergoing interspinous process segmental instrumentation were out of bed sooner (4.5 versus 7.7 days, P less than 0.0001), discharged sooner (32 versus 38 days, P less than 0.079), and brace-free earlier (2.1 versus 5.9 months, P less than 0.001) and had fewer fixation-related complications than did patients undergoing Harrington instrumentation alone. Comparison of average hospital costs documented a savings of $5,160 for the typical patient undergoing interspinous process segmental instrumentation. ",0
"Does blood rheology revert to normal after myocardial infarction? After myocardial infarction there is an acute deterioration of the flow properties of blood. The present study was designed to test whether the abnormality persists. Blood and plasma viscosity, red cell aggregation and deformability, haematocrit, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, white cell count, cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured in 51 patients who had had a myocardial infarction 5.4 (mean) years before. Results in patients and controls were compared and matched pairs with identical cardiovascular risk factors were also selected. Blood viscosity and red cell aggregation were increased and red cell deformability was decreased in the 51 patients. The abnormalities were independent of the interval since infarction and persisted for years. The rheological abnormalities present after myocardial infarction are at least partly independent of the acute event and acute phase reactions. They contribute to the reduced perfusion of the microcirculation of the heart. ",0
"Costs of operating a supported work program for traumatically brain-injured individuals. This paper presents a preliminary analysis of costs associated with a return-to-work program emphasizing a supported employment approach for persons who had sustained severe traumatic brain injuries. This analysis spans almost three years. Results indicated that a mean of 237.8 hours of staff intervention time was required to achieve job stabilization, at a cost of +6896. Ongoing follow-along and support services averaged 1.64 hours per week at a cost of +47.56. Over 68% of total staff time and costs were expended in job-site training and advocacy efforts. Application of these findings to state-level and agency-level policies should be weighed against individual characteristics and needs of clients, program design, and outcomes which clients achieve as a result of services.

"Adjunctive use of beta-adrenergic blockers, calcium antagonists and other therapies in coronary thrombolysis. The availability of thrombolytic agents for use in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction is an important step in the management of a common, often debilitating, and potentially lethal disorder. However, despite the proven benefits of coronary thrombolysis, the importance of adjunctive treatment modalities is being increasingly recognized. Beta-adrenergic blockers, calcium antagonists, nitrates, magnesium, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors each exert favorable cardiovascular properties that may offer additional benefits. Clinical trials combining thrombolytic and adjunctive pharmacologic agents offer hope for further advances in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction. ",0
"Chronic posterior subluxation and dislocation of the radial head. The clinical and radiographic features of chronic posterior subluxation or dislocation of the radial head were studied in thirty-four elbows of twenty-seven patients. Three characteristic radiographic types were noted: Type I, subluxation; Type II, posterior dislocation with minimum displacement; and Type III, posterior dislocation with substantial proximal migration of the radius. Follow-up of eighteen patients (twenty-one elbows) revealed that posterior displacement did not usually cause serious functional impairment except for loss of rotation of the forearm. The least common presentation, Type-I subluxation, caused pain and clicking and was associated with late degenerative arthritis. Cosmetic deformity due to prominence of the radial head was also a cosmetic problem, particularly with Type-III dislocation. ",0
"Combined tensor fasciae latae musculocutaneous flap and sartorius musculocutaneous flap for the repair of wide defects of the lower leg. The tensor fasciae latae musculocutaneous flap has great advantages for reconstruction of the abdominal wall, but the medial border of its territory is limited to the thigh. In order to expand the territory, a combined tensor fasciae latae musculocutaneous flap and sartorius musculocutaneous flap was devised. This flap was successfully used to resurface a large defect in the lower leg as a distally based musculocutaneous flap. The advantages of this flap are its extremely large territory, the fact that total necrosis of the flap cannot occur, and that as a proximally or distally pedicled flap it is suitable for large defects in the abdominal wall, lower leg, and gluteal region.

"Hepatocellular carcinoma with tumor thrombus extending into the right atrium: report of a successful resection with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. Hepatocellular carcinoma with a tumor thrombus extending into the right atrium has been considered beyond the reach of resection. These patients usually die within a short period because of pulmonary embolism, heart failure, or cancer progression. The only treatment is hepatic resection with removal of the tumor thrombus. A 38-year-old woman underwent left lobectomy with removal of the tumor thrombus with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The patient had an uneventful course and is doing well 15 months after surgery, without signs of recurrence. We have proved that hepatic resection with removal of a tumor thrombus extending into the right atrium can be carried out successfully. The next problem is whether the lives of these patients can be prolonged by this operation. ",0
"Clinical results of femoropopliteal bypass using externally supported (EXS) Dacron grafts: with a comparison of above- and below-knee anastomosis. As of the end of September 1989, 52 EXS Dacron grafts had been implanted for femoropopliteal bypass operations. The distal ends of 27 grafts were anastomosed to above-knee popliteal arteries and those of 25 grafts to below-knee popliteal arteries. The cumulative patency rate of above-knee grafts was 71.3% at 54 months, and that of below-knee grafts was 78.8% at 48 months (n.s.). Kinking and stenosis of the arteriosclerotic proximal and/or mid popliteal artery when the knee was bent were angiographically remarkable. These changes may explain why some femoropopliteal grafts occlude with time and why the late results of above-knee grafts are not much better than those of below-knee grafts. ",0
"DNA analysis of multiple synchronous renal cell carcinomas. The authors used retrospective quantitative DNA analysis to study interrelationships between multiple synchronous renal cell carcinomas in seven patients. DNA content was determined by image analysis on Feulgen-stained nuclear smears prepared from multiple paraffin blocks from each tumor. Tumors were unilateral in four cases and bilateral in three. Ten tumors had homogeneous, and four heterogeneous DNA stemlines. Intertumoral heterogeneity in four cases suggested multifocal origin. Identical DNA aneuploid indices in bilateral tumors in one case suggested metastasis from a solitary origin. Abnormal DNA content and heterogeneous populations began to appear in the size range 2.0 to 5.0 cm. All tumors over 5.0 cm contained nondiploid populations. Although the interrelationships between these multiple synchronous neoplasms are not entirely clear, the DNA analysis suggests that the occurrence of nondiploid stemlines and heterogeneous DNA content may parallel both tumor growth and more aggressive behavior.

"Removal of radiation-induced cataracts in patients treated for retinoblastoma. Experience with removal of radiation-induced cataract in patients treated for retinoblastoma is limited. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 38 patients with retinoblastoma (42 eyes) who underwent removal of radiation-induced cataract from 1973 to 1989. Nineteen eyes (45%) without macular tumors or severe radiation complications had final visual acuities in the range of 20/20 to 20/50. One eye (2.4%) developed a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and four eyes (9.5%) were noted to have amblyopia after cataract removal. Three eyes (7%) developed retinoblastoma recurrence, one with extension of retinoblastoma into the subconjunctival space through the previous sclerotomy. Exenteration was performed and the patient was alive after 8 years. Cataract removal can be visually beneficial in selected patients with radiation-induced cataracts. ",0
"Granular cell tumor of the esophagus: endoscopic ultrasonographic demonstration and endoscopic removal. A 35-yr-old Japanese man with a granular cell tumor of the esophagus that was removed by endoscopic polypectomy is presented. Radiography and endoscopy showed a 20 x 12 mm sessile protrusion in the distal esophagus. Endoscopic ultrasonography demonstrated the hypoechoic mass in the submucosa without continuity to the muscularis propria. The lesion was successfully treated by endoscopic polypectomy without complications. The cross-sections of the resected specimen were quite in agreement with the ultrasonographic findings. Endoscopic ultrasonography is valuable to assess the exact location and extent of the tumor, and to determine the indication for endoscopic polypectomy. ",0
Islet cell carcinoma of the pancreas presenting as bleeding from isolated gastric varices. Report of a case and review of the literature. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage from left-sided portal hypertension and gastric varices is an unusual presentation for islet cell carcinoma of the pancreas. Islet cell tumors of the pancreas themselves are rare. They present in a variety of ways. Those that elaborate functional hormones cause specific neuroendocrine syndromes. Nonfunctional tumors characteristically present later with symptoms of metastatic disease or as a result of local enlargement. We present a case of islet cell carcinoma of the pancreas presenting with recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding from gastric varices and review the literature for this rare presentation. We emphasize the importance of a careful initial diagnostic work-up that may enable curative surgery. ,0
"Periventricular hyperintensity detected by magnetic resonance imaging in infancy. Twenty-one infants younger than 12 months of age were diagnosed as having periventricular hyperintensity (PVH) on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Ten infants had experienced neonatal asphyxia, 6 intracranial hemorrhage, 2 bacterial meningitis, and 3 apnea. PVH was classified according to its extent. Round foci of PVH surrounding the frontal and occipital horns of the lateral ventricles were observed in 4 infants (PVH pattern I). Continuous PVH was observed in 17 infants (PVH patterns II and III). Fourteen infants with continuous PVH had spastic diplegia or quadriplegia. Developmental delay was demonstrated in 15 infants with continuous PVH. No PVH pattern I infants had cerebral palsy; only 1 such infant had mild developmental delay. Our study suggests that the extent of PVH reflects the severity of brain damage in neonates with cerebral injuries. ",0
"Cytologic diagnosis of aspergillosis in cardiac transplantation. Fine-needle aspiration of the lung is now widely utilized to diagnose pulmonary neoplasms, but often serologic techniques or open-lung biopsy is relied on for the diagnosis of infectious pulmonary processes. We report a series of four patients in whom the fine-needle aspiration technique was used to make the rapid cytologic diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis. Culture confirmation was also obtained on the aspirated material. A discussion of the available techniques for the laboratory diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis is presented and the advantages of fine-needle aspiration cytology are stressed. Our favorable results support expanded use of fine-needle aspiration cytology in the evaluation of lung nodules appearing in immunosuppressed populations. ",0
"Genotypic analyses of Richter's syndrome. The authors report the immunogenotype of two cases of Richter's syndrome. The immunoglobulin gene rearrangement pattern obtained on Southern Blot analysis was found in both cases to be the same in leukemic blood cells and in the tissue involved by the lymphoma. The beta chain and gamma chain T-cell receptor gene rearrangement pattern exhibited a germ-line configuration in the peripheral blood cells and in the lymph node in Case 2, whereas in Case 1 the lymph node had a gene rearrangement in the beta chain, as well as in the gamma chain T-cell receptor, and the leukemic cells from bone marrow were found to be in a germ-line configuration for T-cell receptors (beta and gamma chains).

"On the inheritance of abdominal aortic aneurysm. To determine the mode of inheritance of abdominal aortic aneurysm, data on first-degree relatives of 91 probands were collected. Results of segregation analysis performed on these data are reported. Many models, including nongenetic and genetic models, were compared using likelihood methods. The nongenetic model was rejected; statistically significant evidence in favor of a genetic model was found. Among the many genetic models compared, the most parsimonious genetic model was that susceptibility to abdominal aortic aneurysm is determined by a recessive gene at an autosomal diallelic major locus. A multifactorial component in addition to the major locus does not increase the likelihood of the data significantly. ",0

"Differentiation in embryonal neuroepithelial tumors of the central nervous system. Ninety-six embryonal neuroectodermal tumors were studied histologically and immunohistologically with a panel of antibodies including glial, neuronal, epithelial, mesodermal, and myelin markers. In 71 tumors there was glial and neuronal differentiation and expression both of an S (photoreceptor) antigen and vimentin. In five tumors there was only glial differentiation and in 20 tumors only neuronal differentiation. No reactivity for myelin and epithelial markers was found. Histologic and immunohistologic findings identified various degrees of differentiation in different tumors, which was bipolar (glial and neuronal) in most tumors and unipolar in the remainder. The authors suggest that their findings may be the result of normal or aberrant oncogenic differentiation, agreeing with the nomenclature of the World Health Organization classification for these tumors with and the inclusion of a category for ependymoblastoma.

Gastrointestinal intraluminal pH in normal subjects and those with colorectal adenoma or carcinoma. Recent evidence suggests that the production of colorectal carcinogens is facilitated when the pH of the colonic contents is alkaline. It follows that the colonic intraluminal pH of patients with colorectal neoplasms should be higher than in normal subjects. Gastrointestinal pH has been measured in 30 patients with colorectal cancer and 37 patients with benign colorectal adenomas (using a pH sensitive radiotelemetry capsule). These values have been compared with those recorded in 66 normal subjects. No differences in gastrointestinal pH were found and the results did not support the hypothesis that colonic pH plays a role in the aetiology of colorectal neoplasia. ,0
"Stressful events and life satisfaction among elderly men and women. The purpose of this study was to examine the interrelationships among stressful events, domain-specific assessments of life satisfaction, and global evaluations of life satisfaction. This research was guided by two competing theoretical formulations. According to bottom-up theory, older adults first assess feelings of satisfaction within specific life domains that are based in part on the experiences (i.e., stressors) they encounter in these areas. The domain-specific views are subsequently synthesized to form an overall sense of satisfaction with life as a whole. In contrast, the top-down theory suggests that a person's ongoing sense of satisfaction with life as a whole predisposes him or her to assess satisfaction with specific domains in ways that are congruent with his or her initial sense of global life satisfaction. Analysis of data provided by older participants in a nationwide survey tends to support the bottom-up perspective. ",0
"The natural history of left ventricular spontaneous contrast. Spontaneous contrast in the left ventricle is an unusual entity. We retrospectively studied 16 patients who were found to have spontaneous contrast present on two-dimensional echocardiograms, specifically noting their clinical characteristics, the reproducibility of this phenomenon, the presence of thrombi and embolic events, and prognostic implications. Diagnoses included ischemic heart disease in nine patients, dilated cardiomyopathy in six patients, and hypertensive cardiomyopathy in one patient. The mean ejection fraction was 17.6%. There were six thromboembolic events in four patients. The spontaneous contrast was reproducible for periods of time up to 39 months. Patients who had improvement in their left ventricular dysfunction or who underwent aneurysmectomy had disappearance of the spontaneous contrast. Those patients who had spontaneous contrast reproduced on subsequent echocardiograms did not seem to have a worse prognosis than patients with similarly depressed ventricular function, but a larger study is necessary to verify this.

"A pitfall in azygos vein cannulation in cirrhotic patients: mistaken cannulation of the mammary vein. Azygos venous flow can be measured by a thermodilution catheter in patients with cirrhosis. This is a useful technique since azygos flow is thought to reflect the superior portosystemic collateral flow in these patients. The authors report 3 cases in which mistaken internal mammary vein cannulation mimicked azygos vein cannulation in the supine fluoroscopic view. A lateral fluoroscopic view confirmed internal mammary cannulation. They suggest that if the azygos arch is unpronounced or flow measurements are unexpectedly low in patients with portal hypertension due to cirrhosis, a lateral view be performed to rule out internal mammary vein cannulation.

"Argon versus krypton panretinal photocoagulation side effects on the anterior segment. The modification of corneal sensitivity, accommodation, pupillary diameter and endothelial cell density after argon versus krypton panretinal photocoagulation were studied prospectively in 88 eyes of 64 diabetic patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, randomized for one of the two laser treatments. In both groups a marked internal ophthalmoplegia and reduction of corneal sensitivity occurred after laser photocoagulation. At no time, 2, 90 and 180 days after PRP, were these parameters significantly different. Endothelial cell loss was non significantly greater in the krypton group. The results indicated that the side effects commonly observed on the anterior segment after PRP are comparable using argon or krypton lasers. ",0
"Neuro-imaging and positron emission tomography of congenital homonymous hemianopsia. Congenital homonymous hemianopsia is an uncommon asymptomatic visual field defect discovered typically in young adult life that is caused by a diverse group of insults to the retrochiasmal afferent visual system occurring prenatally, at birth, or during early childhood. We treated eight patients with congenital homonymous hemianopsia; seven with damage involving the optic radiations and one with an abnormality of the optic tract. We performed positron emission tomography using 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose on two patients with dense homonymous hemianopsias, lesions of the contralateral optic radiations, and largely intact occipital cortex. These studies showed minimal abnormalities in resting visual cortex glucose metabolism of the affected visual cortex. ",0
"Vector short-latency somatosensory-evoked potentials after median nerve stimulation. A new method has been developed for recording short-latency somatosensory-evoked potentials after median nerve stimulation. Negative electrical forces recorded with three orthodiagonal bipolar electrodes in the neck had a direction opposite to that of impulse conduction in the proximal peripheral and cervical somatosensory pathway. Sequential tracings of vectors opposite the electrical forces were made in three-dimensional display, thus reproducing the actual time sequence of electrical events in those structures. Fixed generators such as the subcortical nuclei were also analyzed with this technique, and multiple generators of N13 potential (N13a and N13b) were visualized. This technique may be useful in the functional evaluation of the somatosensory pathway in the cervical cord. ",0
"Contracturing granulomatous myositis: a separate entity. Granulomatous muscle disease is most commonly seen in sarcoidosis, but may be seen in association with a wide variety of other disorders or in isolation. Patients with granulomatous myositis usually present with slowly progressive muscle pain and weakness affecting mainly proximal muscles. There are, however, a few reports of granulomatous muscle disease presenting with flexion contractures of the limbs. Two further patients with granulomatous muscle disease and flexion contractures of the limbs, but with no evidence of systemic granulomatous disease, is presented. It is suggested that such patients represent a separate clinical entity that is distinct from idiopathic granulomatous myositis presenting with muscle pain and weakness. The association of contracturing granulomatous myositis with a long-standing vasculitis in one patient suggests that the two conditions may be related. ",0
"Acinic cell carcinoma. Clinicopathologic review. The authors reviewed 90 cases of acinic cell carcinoma treated at the Mayo Clinic to assess long-term follow-up and to study features predictive of disease progression. Sixty-three patients (55 females and 35 males) were seen for primary treatment; 27 had recurrent disease when first evaluated. Histologically, these tumors were composed of serous acinar cells and intercalated duct-type cells. Morphologic patterns included solid, microcystic, follicular, and papillary-cystic. All patients were followed for at least 10 years or until death. Of the primary treatment group, 44% had local recurrence, 19% had metastasis, and 25% died of disease. Disease first recurred locally up to 30 years after presentation and resulted in death after as many as 38 years. Poor prognostic features include pain or fixation; gross invasion; microscopic features of desmoplasia, atypia, or increased mitotic activity; and excision as initial treatment. Neither morphologic pattern nor cell composition was a predictive feature. ",0
"The Ams (altered mRNA stability) protein and ribonuclease E are encoded by the same structural gene of Escherichia coli. The in vitro and in vivo analysis of the ribonuclease E-deficient (rne-) and the altered mRNA stability protein-deficient (ams-) strains of Escherichia coli has demonstrated that they carry mutations in the same structural gene. Strains encoding either thermolabile RNase E (rne-3071) or Ams protein (ams-1) are defective in both rRNA processing and mRNA turnover. Immediately after a shift to the nonpermissive temperature, the chemical decay rate of bulk mRNA is slowed 2- to 3-fold, and within 70 min, precursors to 5S rRNA begin to accumulate. In addition, all of the phenotypes associated with either the rne-3071 or the ams-1 alleles were complemented by a recombinant plasmid carrying ams+. When taken together with previous genetic studies, these results suggest that the role of ribonuclease E in mRNA turnover involves endonucleolytic cleavages at the proposed ACAG(A/U)AUUUG consensus sequence.

Cerebral infarction in patients with nephrotic syndrome. We describe two adult patients who presented with acute cerebral infarction and were found to have a hypercoagulable state due to nephrotic syndrome. One patient had a deficiency of free protein-S. The other patient had a pulmonary embolus 4 months after the stroke. Our cases demonstrate that the hypercoagulable state associated with nephrotic syndrome can be associated with cerebral arterial thrombosis and infarction in adults. Examination of the urine remains an important part of the evaluation of patients with recent stroke. The presence of severe proteinuria and a low serum albumin content should prompt consideration of a hypercoagulable state. Our experience suggests that anticoagulant drugs may be required to reduce the risk of new thrombotic events. ,0
"Neonatal small bowel atresia, stenosis and segmental dilatation. In 8 years, 44 neonates were treated for small bowel atresia, stenosis or segmental dilatation by one surgical team. There was a single lesion in 30 infants and 14 had two or more sites of intestinal obstruction. Associated gastrointestinal abnormalities were found in 23 (52 per cent) patients. Resection of the atresia(s) and primary anastomosis were performed in 34 infants and staged procedures were carried out in ten patients with complicated lesions. Patients undergoing staged procedures had a higher complication rate than those having primary repair (six out of ten and 11 out of 34 respectively). The overall initial survival rate was 93 per cent, rising to 100 per cent in those without associated anomalies or prenatal complications, but more than a quarter (27 per cent) of survivors have long-term disabilities.

"The perineal artificial sphincter for acquired incontinence--a cut and dried solution? Sixteen males with stress incontinence due to sphincter damage were investigated with videourodynamic studies after implantation of a perineal artificial urinary sphincter. Twelve patients were rendered dry; 4 remained incontinent, all of whom were shown by cystometry to have incontinence from detrusor instability. Of these, 2 also had stress incontinence proven by videourography. Detrusor instability was present in 9 patients before implantation; the instability worsened considerably in 2 patients and new instability was shown in another 2 patients. The limitations of the artificial urinary sphincter and the implications of detrusor instability in patients with an artificial sphincter are discussed. The artificial urinary sphincter is an extremely successful device for the treatment of acquired stress incontinence. ",0
"Growth, thermogenesis, and hyperphagia. Resting metabolic rate is demonstrated to be a function of fat-free mass and a growth variable related to food-energy-input imbalance rate. By use of obligatory energy expenditure terms, the two-reservoir energy model applied to hyperphagia shows that growth of the fat-free mass is rapid whereas that of the fat store is slow and that the growth of both is bounded. Most of the excess energy at the onset of hyperphagia initially goes into the fat store, but this decreases with time until the greater fraction is diverted to the fat-free mass. The two-reservoir model predicts that weight gain per unit of excess energy is not constant but decreases monotonically until ultimately reaching an asymptotic value. Departure of theory and experiment in the long term suggests that facultative considerations become increasingly important. ",0
"Erythropoietin response to anemia as a function of age. The erythropoietin (EPO) response to anemia was assessed for 244 subjects aged 1-64 years (mean 45.2 years) and 121 subjects aged 65-94 years (mean 68.3 years). Subjects included non-anemic individuals as well as those with anemia of various etiologies, excluding renal disease and pregnancy. Significant inverse correlations between serum immunoreactive EPO and hematocrit were noted for both groups. Regression lines failed to show a significantly lower slope or y-intercept for older compared to younger subjects. EPO levels were not significantly lower for older compared to younger subjects when controlled for hematocrit level. These results suggest that the EPO response to anemia in older subjects is similar to that of younger subjects. ",0
"Neodymium: YAG laser hysteroscopy in large submucous fibroids. The preoperative use of a potent, subcutaneously injected gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) was evaluated in a series of 60 women with large submucosal fibroids. Myomectomy by hysteroscopy and Nd:YAG laser was easily performed. In 12 cases, the largest portion of the myoma was not inside the uterine cavity and myomectomy was carried by a two-step hysteroscopy. In women who wished to become pregnant, a pregnancy rate of 66% was achieved. Advantages of preoperative use of a GnRH-a are (1) the significant decrease of the fibroid size, (2) a lower fluid absorption, and (3) the restoration of a normal hemoglobin concentration. ",0
"Multiple intracranial mucoceles associated with phaeohyphomycosis of the paranasal sinuses. The purpose of this article is to alert clinicians to a new pathogenic fungus of the paranasal sinuses called Exserohilum rostratum. Exserohilum species are one of the etiologic agents of phaeohyphomycosis, a constellation of entities caused by dematiaceous fungi. This class of fungal sinus infection has emerged only in the past decade; it occurs primarily in immunocompetent individuals and produces a tenacious, progressive pansinusitis. To our knowledge, this study describes the first case of multiple intracranial mucoceles secondary to E rostratum. The diagnostic workup includes computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging followed by direct microscopic examination of tissue biopsy specimens. A craniotomy followed by a bilateral external ethmoidectomy was necessary for complete extirpation of the infected mucoceles. Aggressive surgical management of this mycotic infection is described.

"Phospholipids from rat, human, and canine gastric mucosa. Composition and metabolism of molecular classes of phosphatidylcholine. To validate a recent proposal that a phospholipid lining with a high content of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine may protect gastric mucosa against luminal acid, it was decided to study composition and metabolism of phospholipids in the gastric mucosa. Phospholipids were analyzed in rat, human, and dog gastric mucosal surface tissue and in a chloroform/methanol-lavage of rat and canine stomach. Phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine were the main components. Saturated fatty acids were almost exclusively esterified at the sn-1 position of the glycerol moiety of phosphatidylcholine, and unsaturated fatty acids mainly at the sn-2 position. The disaturated class of phosphatidylcholine comprised 2%-6% of total phosphatidylcholine. Precursors of phosphatidylcholine, i.e., [32P]orthophosphate and [methyl-14C]choline, were preferentially incorporated into the disaturated molecular class 0.5-6 hours after IV administration. It can be speculated that disaturated phosphatidylcholine, although quantitatively a minor component, is specifically triggered in mucosal renewal processes. ",0
"Sclerotherapy of varicose and telangiectatic leg veins. Minimal sclerosant concentration of hypertonic saline and its relationship to vessel diameter The author reports the results of a double-blind, paired-comparison study using saline sclerosant plus or minus heparin additive. The study was designed to elucidate the effects of increasing concentrations of hypertonic saline with regard to vessel diameter, clinical efficacy, complications, and discomfort. Six hundred women with bilaterally symmetrical starburst telangiectasias or varicose veins were entered into the study. Sodium chloride 11.7% appeared to be the minimal sclerosant concentration of saline that produced the most effective vein sclerosis of vessels of less than 8 mm in diameter, while producing the least morbidity. The optimal concentration of the sclerosant may vary with the diameter of the vessels under therapeutic consideration. ",0
"Quality of life in elderly, chronically ill outpatients. Quality of life (QL) in elderly outpatients is poorly characterized. We interviewed 258 elderly outpatients from three health care settings to identify the attributes and events that affect self-assessment of QL. These outpatients rated their QL as acceptable, citing medical care, health, interpersonal relationships, financial status, and functional status as affecting their QL. Overall QL ratings were not strongly associated with objective indicators such as demographic characteristics and use of health care services. Subjective indicators, including patient perceptions of health, memory, and financial concerns, were correlated independently with global QL (sigma R2 = .35). We conclude that older, chronically ill patients generally consider their QL to be acceptable and affected by a variety of factors, including their perceptions of their emotional, socioeconomic, intellectual, and physical functioning. Furthermore, QL is poorly associated with objective indicators. Thus, in assessing the QL of elderly, chronically ill outpatients, physicians should elicit information regarding these perceptions.

"Comparison of structure, mechanical properties, and functions of lumbar spinal ligaments. The organization of collagen in the supraspinous, interspinous, and longitudinal ligaments, as well as the ligamenta flava, in lumbar spines from human cadavers has been investigated by polarized light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and x-ray diffraction. These experiments were performed on ligaments in situ, with their bony attachments undisturbed, and on excised ligaments at a range of applied strains. Results were related to the composition (investigated by standard histologic techniques) and gross structures (investigated by light microscopy) of the ligaments. More importantly, the results were related to the mechanical properties of the ligaments, which include stiffness, failure conditions, stress relaxation, and hysteresis. Where necessary, results were supplemented by or compared with those obtained from pig ligaments. Mechanical properties were related to postural changes by ligament strains induced in cadaveric specimens, using results from the literature. Thus, ligament structures could be related to their physiologic functions. ",0
"Management of penile gunshot wounds. The management of 10 cases of penile gunshot wounds treated at Henry Ford Hospital from 1982 to 1986 is reviewed. All patients were assaulted by low velocity weapons (handguns). Eight patients had associated injuries, predominantly to the genital region (thigh, pubis, and scrotum). There were 5 urethral injuries; 4 were treated with primary repair, the remaining patient underwent delayed repair, complicated by severe urethral strictures requiring reoperation. Blood at the urethral meatus was suggestive of urethral injury but microscopic hematuria was not. Five penile injuries did not involve the urethra and were treated by debridement and primary wound closure with no immediate or delayed complications. In dealing with these injuries we recommend a high index of suspicion for urethral and regional organ injury and primary urethral closure if at all possible. ",0
"Ocular complications of rheumatic diseases of childhood. The association between inflammatory ocular and articular disease is a strong one, although the pathogenesis of this relationship is obscure. For the physician or surgeon caring for children with chronic arthritis, awareness of the risk of chronic asymptomatic anterior uveitis is essential if early diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of visual impairment are to be accomplished. This is particularly true for children with pauciarticular-onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis. Acute symptomatic anterior uveitis is characteristic of disorders such as ankylosing spondylitis. Whereas this disease is initially more unpleasant for the child, it has a good long-term prognosis.

"The Maylard incision in gynecologic surgery The transverse muscle-splitting Maylard incision was used in 175 gynecologic patients who required pelvic-abdominal surgery. One hundred fifty-three patients (87%) had pelvic malignancy; other indications for operation included uterine myomas, endometriosis, tuboovarian abscess, and benign ovarian cysts. Exposure was excellent: 54% of patients underwent pelvic lymphadenectomy and 17% underwent paraaortic lymphadenectomy. Twelve patients (6.9%) had wound complications, but there was neither long-term morbidity nor mortality associated with the incision. Fifty-six patients (32%) received preoperative or postoperative pelvic radiation therapy with no detrimental effect on wound healing. The Maylard incision is cosmetic, strong, easily learned, and has an acceptable complication rate. Unless a vertical incision is indicated, the Maylard technique is preferred when optimal exposure and accessibility to the pelvis are required. ",0
"Effect of motilin on gastric emptying in patients with diabetic gastroparesis. OBJECTIVES: Because disturbances of gastric emptying are a serious complication in insulin-dependent diabetic subjects with regard to the maintenance of good metabolic control, we wanted to assess the effectiveness of motilin as a potential treatment for gastric emptying disturbances. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The intestinal hormone motilin has been shown to accelerate gastric emptying in healthy subjects. Therefore, we examined the effect of intravenous motilin on gastric emptying of a 99mTc colloid-labeled semisolid test meal in 9 insulin-dependent diabetic patients with diabetic gastroparesis. All patients had a significantly delayed gastric emptying rate compared with a group of 11 healthy control subjects. RESULTS: During the infusion of motilin, gastric emptying was accelerated, and it was no longer significantly different from control values. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that motilin and related compounds such as erythromycin derivatives could be useful for the treatment of disturbed gastric emptying in diabetic subjects. ",0
"Isolated erythroid hypoplasia and renal insufficiency induced by long-term griseofulvin therapy. We describe a patient with hematuria, pyuria, eosinophiluria, decreased renal function, and severe anemia that developed while she was receiving chronic therapy with griseofulvin for onychomycosis. We offer evidence that griseofulvin can cause an isolated erythroid hypoplasia and possibly an allergic interstitial nephritis. This is the first documented case of the above entities induced by the agent. We would recommend, based on our report, that otherwise healthy patients, when maintained on the drug for extended periods of time, have periodic determinations of renal function and hematologic status. As drug-induced erythroid hypoplasia typically occurs after a relatively long period of dosing, it may be prudent in certain individuals to monitor the CBC at approximately bimonthly intervals after initiation of therapy. Recommendations regarding monitoring of renal function are more difficult, as acute allergic interstitial nephritis can occur after either short- or long-term exposure to certain drugs. ",0
"Doppler diagnostics, indications, and control of surgical treatment in patients with carotid pathology. Major stroke is a relatively common cause of death or disabling invalidism in patients with atherosclerosis. In a large percentage of cases it is caused by stenotic/thrombotic processes in carotid arteries and this emphasizes the importance of the problem of early diagnosis and treatment of carotid pathology. Recently Doppler sonography has become a leading non-invasive method of early screening of stenotic processes in carotid arteries. The aim of the present study was to ascertain the diagnostic abilities of Doppler sonography for screening of carotid pathology, assessment of extra-cranial and intracranial hemodynamics, defining of indications, and control of vascular reconstructions of carotids.

"The neuromuscular pathology of the Eosinophilia-Myalgia syndrome. The Eosinophilia-Myalgia Syndrome (EMS) is a recently reorganized disorder in patients ingesting pharmacologic doses of L-tryptophan. We studied the lesions of skeletal muscle, peripheral nerve and skin in 12 cases of EMS. Perimyositis was severe in four, moderate in two, mild in three and absent in three cases. The lesions contained many eosinophils, T-helper cells, mast cells and activated macrophages. Type 2 myofiber atrophy was present in five cases and in one, this was the only pathologic finding. Severe epineurial inflammation was seen in the three sural nerve biopsies. Indirect evidence for peripheral neurologic involvement in three other cases consisted of inflammation surrounding intramuscular nerve twigs (two cases) and neurogenic atrophy (one case). Phlebitis accompanied the connective tissue inflammation in five cases and endarteritis in one. Fasciitis was present in three of four skin biopsies and dermal fibrosis in one. ",0
"Atonic pupil: an unusual complication of cataract surgery. Eight cases of atonic pupil, an unusual complication following cataract surgery, are presented. Six of the eyes involved had intracapsular cataract extraction and anterior chamber intraocular lens implantation; one case underwent extracapsular cataract extraction with a posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation; the other had an extracapsular procedure with no implant. The etiology is unknown, but we believe the most likely one is that the sodium hyaluronate used in all these patients caused a temporary reduction of the iris blood supply by mechanical factors or by a vasoconstriction induced by some toxicity of the material that produced a lesion on the iris sphincter.

"Lumbar spinal nerves in the neural foramen: MR appearance. The appearance of the proximal lumbar spinal nerves at magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has not, to the authors' knowledge, been described. MR images and exactly corresponding sections obtained from four cadavers by means of a freezing microtome were correlated to characterize the MR appearance of the proximal spinal nerves. The junction of the dorsal and ventral rami with the dorsal and ventral roots consists of a group of six to 15 fascicles measuring 2-6 mm in length. These fascicles appear in MR images obtained with short repetition times as small foci of lower signal intensity than that of surrounding fat. The proximal spinal nerve and its relationship to the intervertebral disk and osseous margins of the neural foramen can be demonstrated effectively with MR imaging. ",0
"Synergistic effects of INTERCEED(TC7) and heparin in reducing adhesion formation in the rabbit uterine horn model. Surgical adjuvants are commonly employed to reduce the frequency of postoperative adhesion development after reproductive pelvic surgery. The ability of indomethacin, promethazine dexamethasone, Intralipid, progesterone, and heparin to reduce adhesion formation in combination with INTERCEED(TC7) (Johnson and Johnson Medical, Inc., New Brunswick, NJ), an absorbable barrier that alone reduces adhesion formation, was examined in a rabbit uterine horn model. A significant reduction in adhesion formation was only observed with the combination of INTERCEED(TC7) plus heparin. In addition studies, heparin delivery by intraperitoneal (IP) lavage, intravenous injection, or intra-abdominal instillation failed to demonstrate efficacy. Similarly, heparin delivery with other barriers or IP instillates (carboxymethylcellulose or 32% Dextran 70) failed to reduce adhesion formation. We conclude that INTERCEED(TC7) can be efficaciously utilized as a carrier to deliver heparin to traumatized surfaces, thereby reducing adhesion formation. ",0
"Intra-abdominal ""angiosarcomatosis"" report of two cases after pelvic irradiation. Angiosarcomas account for only 1% to 2% of all soft tissue sarcomas with the most common site of origin being skin and subcutaneous tissue particularly on the face and scalp of elderly patients. These neoplasms rarely arise in the small or large bowel with presentation as diffuse abdominal ""angiosarcomatosis."" Two patients are reported who were treated with adjuvant pelvic irradiation for gynecologic malignancies (squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix and adenocarcinoma of the endometrium) in whom diffuse abdominal angiosarcoma of intestinal origin developed 7 and 18 years later. Both patients were treated with standard megavoltage irradiation. The clinical course was rapid in both cases with death due to intra-abdominal hemorrhage and bowel obstruction. The pertinent literature relating to the association between radiation therapy and subsequent development of angiosarcomas of soft tissues and other sites is briefly reviewed. ",0
"The risk for systemic vascular diseases and mortality in patients with central retinal vein occlusion. In this cross-sectional study, the authors evaluated 197 patients diagnosed with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) at the Wilmer Ophthalmological Institute between 1980 and 1985 to determine the risk of systemic disease and mortality. Complete follow-up information for mortality was obtained in 191 (97%). National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) patients and Wilmer cataract patients formed two comparison groups. The prevalence of hypertension was significantly elevated in the CRVO cases when compared with both comparison groups (P less than 0.03, 0.005). The prevalence of diabetes mellitus was increased in CRVO cases in comparison with the NHIS group (P less than 0.005). The prevalence of cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease was the same for all three groups, as was overall mortality. Mortality was not increased in CRVO cases as compared with United States mortality rates. ",0
"Mucocele of the cystic duct remnant in eight liver transplant recipients: findings at cholangiography, CT, and US. The case histories and radiologic studies of eight liver transplant recipients who developed a mucocele of the allograft cystic duct remnant were retrospectively evaluated. All patients had clinical and/or laboratory evidence of biliary obstruction or cholangitis from 2 weeks to 3.3 years following transplantation. Cholangiographic, ultrasound (US), and computed tomography (CT) images were available for review in eight, five, and four patients, respectively. Cholangiograms demonstrated an extrinsic mass compressing the common hepatic duct in seven of eight patients. US and CT showed fairly well- to well-defined round fluid collections adjacent to the common hepatic duct in three and two patients, respectively. The findings of this study suggest that the detection at cholangiography of an extrinsic mass compressing the common hepatic duct appears to be specific for a mucocele of the allograft cystic duct remnant. CT and US images may offer confirmatory evidence. ",0
"'Cystic papilloma' in humans? Demonstration of human papillomavirus in plantar epidermoid cysts. Fourteen cases of plantar epidermoid cyst were studied immunohistochemically and five of them were also studied electron microscopically for the presence of human papillomavirus. In eleven cases, the test results were positive for papillomavirus antigens, and in five of them, papillomaviruslike particles were observed by electron microscopy. Histological examination showed most of the cysts to contain intracytoplasmic eosinophilic bodies in cells of the cyst wall as well as the vacuolar structures in the keratinous mass within the cavity. These findings suggest an etiologic association between the papillomavirus and plantar epidermoid cysts. The ""cystic papilloma"" produced in rabbits by the Shope papillomavirus has been clearly demonstrated. We propose that human papillomaviruses play an important role in the genesis of plantar epidermoid cysts. This is the first report on the possible existence of a cystic papilloma in humans. ",0
"Flow cytometric DNA content of adenoid cystic carcinoma of submandibular gland. Correlation of histologic features and prognosis. Flow cytometric analysis of nuclear DNA content was performed in 26 adenoid cystic carcinomas of the submandibular gland using archived, paraffin-embedded tissues. The DNA content was compared with multiple histologic parameters and clinical course. Ten carcinomas (38%) were aneuploid and 16 (62%) diploid. Aneuploid carcinomas demonstrated a higher frequency of solid cytoarchitecture, lymph node metastases, and advanced clinical stage, as compared with diploid carcinomas. Other histologic features predicting aggressive clinical behavior also correlated with abnormal DNA content and included invasion of nerves larger than 0.25 mm and intravascular extension. Our data suggest that DNA content analysis can be an effective objective parameter in the clinicopathologic assessment of adenoid cystic carcinoma. ",0
"Decalcification of a choroidal osteoma. A 56-year-old man presented with a clearly defined orange tumour in the posterior pole of his left eye. A choroidal osteoma was suspected, and ultrasonography confirmed the diagnosis. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated subretinal neovascularisation on the nasal edge of the tumour, which was treated with krypton laser photocoagulation twice. Recurrent subretinal neovascularisation occurred one year later and was not amenable to treatment. Three years after the patient first presented, thinning of the tumour was noted on follow-up examination. During the next 15 months the tumour completely disappeared, leaving an area of retinal pigment epithelial and choroidal atrophy. Total decalcification of the choroidal osteoma was demonstrated by ultrasonography. ",0
"Pelvic pain: lessons from anatomy and physiology. Pelvic pain is often a difficult differential diagnosis in the emergency department. For physiologic reasons, pain in the pelvis is difficult to localize to a specific organ, and pelvic peritonitis is hard to recognize. On the other hand, differences in types of pain can be very useful in arriving at a correct diagnosis. The clinician must learn to recognize superficial and deep somatic pain, and differentiate between various types of visceral pain which originate from inflammation, ischemia, or colic. A review of the anatomy and physiology of pelvic pain helps identify some of the problems as well as potential aids in approaching the patient with pelvic pain. ",0
"Expression and characterization of TCA3: a murine inflammatory protein. TCA3 is a cDNA originally isolated from activated T cells. Transcription of this gene has been shown to correlate with Ag-induced cellular activation of both T cells and mast cells. Based on the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by the cDNA, we previously proposed that TCA3 represents a cytokine. In this report we have used rDNA technology to express TCA3 in two mammalian cell lines. In both cases, TCA3 was expressed as a secreted molecule with an apparent molecular mass of 16 kDa. Digestion of the (rTCA3) with the enzyme N-glycanase revealed that approximately 8 kDa is caused by N-linked glycosylation. Intradermal injection of rTCA3 into mouse footpads resulted in a rapid swelling response. The sites of injection were characterized histologically by a local accumulation of neutrophils. These findings are discussed with particular attention to a family of related proteins, some of whose members also have inflammatory properties. ",0
"Risk ratios and risk differences in estimating the effect of risk factors for cardiovascular disease in the elderly. This article reviews the nature of the effects of hypertension, smoking and cholesterol on the incidence of cardiovascular disease and emphasizes how these effects vary by age. In the Methods section, we discuss briefly the concepts of additive and multiplicative statistical models as tools for summarizing data. In the results section, we summarize available data on the association between incident stroke and coronary heart disease in the elderly and each of these major risk factors. The traditional multiplicative model parsimoniously characterizes the individual and joint effects of age and high blood pressure in terms of risk ratios; but, for smoking and cholesterol, an additive model appears to be the most parsimonious. We discuss the consequences of these observations for the study and prevention of cardiovascular disease in the elderly. ",0
Cyclosporine-induced thrombotic microangiopathy resulting in renal allograft loss and its successful reuse: a report of two cases. Cyclosporine-induced thrombotic microangiopathy is a rare complication of renal transplantation. It commonly leads to graft loss. The mechanism of this entity is unknown. Factors intrinsic to the donor kidney appear to play an important role. We describe two cases of renal transplant patients who lost their first grafts secondary to cyclosporine-induced thrombotic microangiopathy. These patients were successfully retransplanted with an immunosuppressive protocol that included long-term cyclosporine. We conclude that graft loss from this entity is not a contraindication to subsequent successful transplantation with cyclosporine. ,0
"Laparoscopic management of ovarian cysts. One hundred two women with ovarian cysts were managed laparoscopically over a 13-year period. Thirteen were treated with laparoscopic inspection followed by laparotomy, 6 with laparoscopic fine needle aspiration followed by laparotomy and 83 with laparoscopic fenestration and biopsy, with or without coagulation or removal of the cyst lining. Satisfactory results were noted in patients treated completely with laparoscopy. Only 1 of 56 functional, simple or paraovarian cysts recurred during the study period. Two of the 18 ovarian endometriomas treated with fenestration and coagulation or removal of the lining recurred, whereas 8 of 9 such lesions recurred when treated with fenestration alone. There were no surgical complications. ",0
"Facial muscle reanimation using the trigeminal motor nerve: an experimental study in the rabbit. Surgical repair of facial nerve deficits may be marred by lack of muscle control and donor region paresis. Using New Zealand white rabbits, a study was undertaken to evaluate facial muscle reanimation with a donor source not previously used: the motor division of the trigeminal nerve. The results were compared with the severed facial nerve and hypoglossal-facial coaptation. An atrophy scale was calibrated for facial muscles of the rabbit. Clinical, electromyographic, and histomorphometric findings confirmed that the trigeminal nerve was a suitable donor source. The neurorrhaphy produced an exponential rate of repair. ",0
"Radical resection for carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater. One hundred four consecutive patients who underwent radical resection for ampullary cancer between 1965 and 1989 were retrospectively reviewed. Frequent clinical findings included jaundice (67%), significant (greater than 10%) weight loss (42%), and anemia (27%). Eighty-seven patients (84%) underwent a subtotal pancreatectomy, and 17 patients (16%) underwent a total pancreatectomy. The postoperative mortality was 5.7% (six patients), and reoperation for postoperative complications was required in six patients. The 5- and 10-year survival rates were 34% and 25%, respectively. Eight patients died of tumor recurrence more than 5 years after resection. Patient survival was significantly impaired by microscopic lymphatic invasion, regional nodal metastasis, tumor grade, and the epithelium of origin. In a multivariate analysis, only microscopic lymphatic invasion significantly reduced patient survival. Radical resection for ampullary cancer can be performed with a low morbidity and mortality and should remain the procedure of choice for ampullary carcinoma. ",0
"Lateral medullary infarction: prognosis in an unselected series. We describe the acute and long-term prognosis in 43 patients with lateral medullary infarction (LMI) collected from a population-based stroke registry from 1982 to July 1988. Mean age was 63.9 years and median time of follow-up was 33 months. In the acute phase, 5 patients (11.6%) died from respiratory and cardiovascular complications and 2 new strokes occurred, both in the posterior circulation. During follow-up, recurrent vertebrobasilar territory strokes occurred in only 2 patients (a rate of 1.9% per year). The mechanisms of stroke were vertebral artery (VA) branch occlusion, causing a medial medullary syndrome, and basilar artery thrombosis propagating from a contralateral, distal VA stenosis. In the acute phase of LMI, respiratory and cardiovascular events, presumably caused by autonomic dysfunction related to the lateral medullary lesion, are the major hazards. Recurrent posterior circulation strokes were uncommon during follow-up. ",0
"Carcinoma of female urethra. Manitoba experience: 1958-1987. Fourteen female patients with primary urethral carcinoma were treated at the Manitoba Cancer Foundation in the last twenty-nine years. The relationship of natural history to the stage, location, and therapeutic modality has been reviewed. A higher stage and length of urethral involvement affected prognosis negatively, whereas lower stage had a positive prognostic effect and location of tumor had no prognostic influence. Two patients with Stage C, who failed to received inguinal node radiotherapy, died of disease recurring in the inguinal area. Patients who received inguinal radiation (3 patients Stages B, C, and D1) had no regional recurrence. It is suggested that, for all female urethral carcinoma, bilateral ilioinguinal nodes be included in the radiation field. For radical treatment, iridium 192 insertion in combination with external beam treatment is recommended. ",0
"Rehabilitation in brain disorders. 4. Specific disorders. This self-directed learning module highlights important aspects of medical rehabilitation of patients with brain disorders. The specific disorders reviewed in this module are traumatic brain injury, stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and other degenerative disorders. This module is a section of the chapter on rehabilitation of brain disorders for the Self-Directed Medical Knowledge Program Study Guide for practitioners and trainees in physical medicine and rehabilitation. The chapter is composed of four articles, and each builds on principles established in the others. Emphasis is given in this section on key elements of current medical practice, including epidemiology, pathophysiology, prognosis, and outcome. Neurologic assessment and management is highlighted for coma, amnesia, cranial nerve and late intracranial complications, postacute management, and postconcussive syndromes. The learner is directed to articles 1, 2, and 3 in this chapter for supporting information. ",0
"DNA ploidy pattern in rectal carcinoid tumors. The nuclear DNA pattern of 22 rectal carcinoids was determined by cytophotometry of paraffin embedded tissues. The results were compared with clinical as well as histopathologic features of the tumor. Three of the carcinoids with synchronous or metachronous metastasis had aneuploid DNA pattern, whereas 19 tumors with no metastasis showed diploid DNA pattern. No other single clinical or pathologic feature of the tumor could predict more accurately the malignant potential and the subsequent course of the rectal carcinoid. It is concluded that DNA aneuploidy in rectal carcinoid tumors is not so rare as indicated by earlier studies and that it is a factor of significant prognostic value. ",0
"Sensitivity and specificity of various morphological features of cervical condylomas. An in situ hybridization study. Fifty-seven cervical biopsy specimens or endocervical curettings showing condyloma, changes suggestive of condyloma, or no changes of condyloma were analyzed for presence of nuclear atypia (nuclear enlargement and irregularity in superficial epithelium), presence of multinucleated cells, and presence of perinuclear cytoplasmic clearing in superficial squamous epithelium. The findings were correlated with results of in situ hybridization with biotin-labeled human papillomavirus DNA probes. Moderate nuclear atypia was significantly more specific than perinuclear cytoplasmic clearing and 100% sensitive for predicting cases positive for human papillomavirus. Of the various morphological features analyzed, perinuclear cytoplasmic clearing had the lowest specificity for predicting positive results on in situ hybridization. ",0
"Nursing home patients transferred by ambulance to a VA emergency department. Nursing home residents are frequently transferred to hospital emergency departments. Delayed transfer may lead to poor outcomes. However, inappropriate transfer of the frail elderly may cause social and financial problems. We prospectively evaluated 221 consecutive ambulance transfers from community nursing homes to a VA emergency department. The objectives of the study were to describe the process and outcomes of transferred patients and to determine if alternative interventions were feasible. The results indicate that the problems of nearly half the study group could have been treated at the nursing home by a visiting physician with minimal medical equipment. Those admitted to the hospital (52%) were seriously ill, had prolonged lengths of stay (23.6 days), and had a high mortality rate (11%). Complex issues of physician reimbursement, proprietary nursing home budgeting, and day-to-day expediency appear to be involved in decisions to transport patients by ambulance to VA emergency departments.

"Association of disease-free survival and percent of ideal dose in adjuvant breast chemotherapy. The relationship between percent of ideal dose and disease-free survival was examined in 256 Stage II and III patients who participated in a 2-year breast adjuvant chemotherapy trial consisting of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) given postoperatively. When analyzed analogously to previous work, the results confirmed a dose-response relationship: that is, there appeared to be an improved disease-free survival for patients receiving higher doses of adjuvant chemotherapy. The major criticism of such an analysis is its bias. This bias was addressed by considering only patients who were still receiving therapy at 6, 12, and 24 months; then, the dose-response relationship was no longer seen. Although causality cannot be inferred, the apparent differences in disease-free survival among the dose groups can be attributed to recurrences in the first 2 years among patients receiving lower doses of chemotherapy.

"Coronary collateral recruitment: functional significance and relation to rate of vessel closure. Studies in animals and humans have demonstrated the anatomic presence and functional significance of coronary collaterals. The extent of collateralization varies among species and among individuals. Collateral vessels are usually adequate for preserving resting regional and global ventricular function in the face of coronary obstruction. During stress, however, collateral supply may be inadequate. Collateral development is a time-dependent process during both the initial occlusion and following transient reflow and reclosure. Therefore when a previously collateralized coronary occlusion is recanalized and then recloses, the extent of the resulting collateral recruitment will depend, at least in part, upon the period of reflow between the two occlusions. The longer the reflow period, the less enhanced will be the collateralization. This is illustrated in the cases presented and has also been demonstrated in animal studies. The exact mechanisms for this recurrent collateral recruitment need further study. ",0
"Metastatic small cell tumor of bone with 'true' rosettes and glial fibrillary acidic protein positivity. A 15-year-old black girl was admitted to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital with a lytic lesion involving the right fourth metacarpal bone with a solitary metastasis to the ipsilateral axillary lymph node. Histologic examination of both the primary lesion and metastasis revealed a primitive small round cell lesion. Abundant rosettes with central lumina were present in the metastasis. Immunohistochemical stains performed on sections of the metastasis were strongly positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and negative for neuron-specific enolase (NSE), S-100 protein, and Leu-7. Electron microscopic examination of the metastasis revealed lumen formation with apical microvilli and juxtaluminal junctional complexes. This tumor exhibits features that are suggestive, but not definitive, of primitive ependymal differentiation and further expands the morphologic and immunophenotypic range of small round cell tumors of bone.

"Extrahepatic portal vein aneurysm associated with a tortuous portal vein. Portal vein aneurysm is rare and its etiology is controversial. A case of extrahepatic portal vein aneurysm associated with an unusually tortuous portal vein is described. Real-time ultrasonography showed anechoic masslike lesions at the porta hepatis communicating with the superior mesenteric vein and intrahepatic portal branches. This suggested the presence of two saccular portal vein aneurysms, 27 x 21 mm and 21 x 13 mm in size. Magnetic resonance imaging and portal venography confirmed the portal vein aneurysms and an unusually tortuous portal vein curving caudally between them. The liver was histologically normal and there was no evidence of portal hypertension. It is speculated that these portal vein aneurysms may have been congenital and that the associated tortuous portal vein might have been secondary to hemodynamic changes in the portal venous system.

Pancreaticobiliary ductal union. The main pancreatic duct and the common bile duct open into the second part of the duodenum alone or after joining as a common channel. A common channel of greater than 15 mm (an anomalous pancreaticobiliary duct) is associated with congenital cystic dilatation of the common bile duct and carcinoma of the gall bladder. Even a long common channel (greater than or equal to 8 mm) is associated with a higher frequency of carcinoma of the gall bladder. Gall stones smaller than the common channel and a long common channel predispose to gall stone induced acute pancreatitis. Separate openings for the two ductal systems predisposes to development of gall stones and alcohol induced chronic pancreatitis. The role of ductal union has also been investigated in primary sclerosing cholangitis and biliary atresia. ,0
"Benign missense variations in the cystic fibrosis gene. The common mutation causing cystic fibrosis is a deletion of phenylalanine 508 (delta F508), which occurs in a putative nucleotide-binding fold of the gene product. We report two additional mutations, substitution of cysteine for phenylalanine 508 (F508C) and substitution of valine for isoleucine 506 (I506V). Three compound heterozygous persons, two delta F508/F508C and one delta F508/I506V, had normal clinical and epithelial physiological studies indicating that the F508C and I506V mutations are benign. This opportunity to study the in vivo function of these mutations suggests that amino acid substitutions are more benign than changes in the length of this portion of the putative nucleotide-binding fold. These mutations must be taken into account when performing molecular diagnosis and carrier detection for cystic fibrosis. ",0
"Polyglucosan body disease. Adult polyglucosan disease has been described in 15 cases. All had signs of peripheral neuropathy, upper motor neuron signs, and 12 of the 15 had sphincter problems. Dementia was prominent in 8 of 15 cases. We reported 2 cases that contained these clinical features. Electrophysiological studies showed axonal neuropathy. Somatosensory evoked potentials on the second patient were abnormal. Sural nerve biopsy showed clusters of polyglucosan bodies. Although the presence of polyglucosan bodies in biopsy is nonspecific, the number as well as the clinical features are necessary to make the diagnosis. Branching enzyme activity in muscle extracts of the muscles were normal. Hence, a specific enzyme abnormality is not yet known. ",0
"Susceptibility to invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b disease and the immunoglobulin G2m(n) allotype. There has been considerable controversy about the role of the immunoglobulin G2m(n) allotype and risk of invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) disease. This allotype was studied in a large cohort of Finnish children (178) with invasive Hib disease. The G2m(n) allotype distribution was similar to that in the normal white Finnish population. No increased risk of Hib disease could be associated with the n-/n- genotype [i.e., lack of G2m(n) allotype]. Thus, the G2m(n) allotype does not seem to be a major determinant of susceptibility to Hib infection among white populations in industrialized countries. ",0
"Effects of prostaglandin E1 on collagen diseases with high levels of circulating immune complexes. Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) was administered to 4 patients with collagen diseases presenting with high levels of circulating immune complexes (CIC) in sera. Our study patients had progressive systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, polyarteritis nodosa, and rheumatoid arthritis. In all 4 patients, CIC levels significantly decreased after administration of PGE1 by continuous infusion at 10/ng/kg/min via central venous catheter for 72 h. In addition, the skin ulcer in a patient with PSS healed completely, and the finger necrosis in a patient with RA improved. These results suggest that PGE1 given by continuous venous infusion is effective in reducing CIC, in addition to improving peripheral vascular disorders. ",0
"Acute syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis. Six patients with evidence of secondary syphilis presented with visual loss in both eyes caused by large, placoid, yellowish lesions with faded centers at the level of the pigment epithelium in the macula and juxtapapillary areas. All eyes had vitreitis. All of the lesions showed a similar fluorescein angiographic pattern of early hypofluorescence and late staining. Five patients had mucocutaneous lesions typical of secondary syphilis. All five patients treated with antibiotics had prompt improvement in visual function and resolution of the fundus lesions. The ophthalmoscopic and angiographic appearance of these posterior fundus lesions was sufficiently characteristic to suggest a diagnosis of secondary syphilis. Modification of the host response to syphilis by human immune deficiency virus (HIV) infection may be partly responsible for this peculiar fundus picture. Three of the four patients tested positive for HIV. ",0
"Extrapyramidal features in advanced Down's syndrome: clinical evaluation and family history. Extrapyramidal, frontal release, and other neurological signs were studied in 54 demented and non-demented patients with Down's syndrome (DS). Fourteen patients were demented and five showed extrapyramidal signs, mainly of the rigid-hypokinetic spectrum and similar to Parkinsonian features in advanced Alzheimer's disease (AD). None of the non-demented patients had Parkinsonian signs. The mean age of the demented DS patients with extrapyramidal signs was significantly higher than that of the patients without. Frontal release signs were present in demented and non-demented patients. A questionnaire showed no increase in either the proportion of early- or senile-onset dementia or Parkinsonism among first- and second-degree relatives of DS patients. Parkinsonian signs appear to be present at a lower frequency in DS than in advanced AD. A speculative hypothesis about a gene dosage effect of Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase in preventing toxic radical formation in the substantia nigra of DS patients is presented. ",0
"Thoracoscopic treatment of spontaneous pneumothorax using carbon dioxide laser. In an effort to improve the success rate of the previously described thoracoscopic electrocautery ablation technique of spontaneous pneumothorax, the carbon dioxide laser was evaluated in 12 patients. The recurrent (5 patients) or persistent (7 patients) spontaneous pneumothoraces were caused by rupture of (1) blebs in 6 patients, (2) intrapulmonary apical type II bullae in 3 patients, and (3) diffuse bullous emphysema, type III, in 3. The air leaks were successfully sealed in all but 1 patient with ruptured type II bulla. Surgical specimen from this single failure suggested that the entire inner lining of the bullae must be thermocoagulated. This technical modification led to successful outcome in 2 subsequent cases. With the use of carbon dioxide laser, it was possible to treat not only small blebs but all types of bullae causing spontaneous pneumothorax. Laser thoracoscopy is effective and safe in treating spontaneous pneumothorax. ",0
"Use of the metabolic tracer carbon-11-acetate for evaluation of regional myocardial perfusion. The high first-pass myocardial extraction fraction of carbon-11-acetate suggests that its initial uptake depends on blood flow. Accordingly, regional uptake of 11C-acetate at 4 min was compared to regional perfusion determined with nitrogen-13-ammonia in 119 segments in 15 patients with stable coronary artery disease by two methods. A close correlation was observed between initial relative myocardial concentrations (segmental activity normalized to maximal activity) of both tracers (11C-acetate = 0.88; 13N-ammonia + 0.079; s.e.e. = 0.064, r = 0.94, p less than 0.001). Furthermore, segmental net extractions (E.F), as calculated from the input function and segmental activities, of the two tracers correlated closely by E.FC-11 = 0.55E.FN-13 + 0.080 (s.e.e. = 0.045, r = 0.87, p less than 0.001). These relationships indicate that initial regional myocardial uptake of 11C-acetate reflects perfusion and that 11C-acetate permits near simultaneous evaluation of regional oxidative metabolism and of regional myocardial perfusion.

"Prehospital care: the future of emergency medical services. Most prehospital interventions, both pharmacologic and procedural, have been accepted without clear demonstrations of their abilities to impact patient outcomes or without clear indications that withholding or delaying the intervention pending arrival at a definitive emergency department will adversely affect the patient. Interventions that have the benefit of supportive research have been applied equally to urban and nonurban emergency medical services environments. In selecting interventions, inadequate consideration has been given to the differences in emergency medical services personnel training, frequencies of their exposure to patients, frequencies of skill use, and availabilities of effective continuing education programs in the urban and nonurban environments. These issues are discussed, and the necessary focus of the future of emergency medical services in urban, suburban, and rural environments is predicted. ",0
"Colposcopic survey of Papanicolaou test-negative cases with hyperkeratosis or parakeratosis. A colposcopic survey was performed in 269 consecutive women with negative cytology showing hyperkeratosis or parakeratosis. A colposcopy-guided biopsy specimen of cervical abnormalities was taken in 88 cases, and human papillomavirus infection (HPV) was detected histologically in 25 cases. No cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) was detected. The detection rate of HPV was not significantly different from that observed in a consecutive series of 1073 Papanicolaou test-negative subjects self-referred for colposcopy. Colposcopic screening of subjects showing hyperkeratosis or parakeratosis with otherwise negative smears is not recommended because it does not allow detection of cytologically false-negative CIN.

"Fluorosilicone oil in the treatment of retinal detachment. We evaluated the use of a heavier-than-water fluorinated silicone oil in the treatment of 30 selected cases of complicated retinal detachment from January 1988 to July 1989. Proliferative vitreoretinopathy grade C-2 or greater accounted for 19 cases, proliferative diabetic retinopathy with traction detachment for two cases, giant retinal tears five, ruptured globe with retinal detachment two, massive choroidal effusion with retinal detachment one, and acute retinal necrosis with retinal detachment one. Initial retinal reattachment was achieved in all cases. Complications included redetachment seven (23%), cataract six (75% of phakic patients), raised intraocular pressure four (13%), hypotony four (13%), keratopathy three (10%), uveitis-synechia formation three (10%), phthisis two (3%), choroidal haemorrhage one (3%), and vitreous haemorrhage one (3%). Postoperative visual acuities with at least six months' follow-up range from no light perception to 20/50, with seven patients (23%) 20/400 or better. ",0
"Human immunodeficiency virus-induced immunosuppression: a risk factor for human papillomavirus infection. In a group of 92 women with genital condylomata, 15 (16.3%) human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients were found, whereas no case was detected in a control group of 100 women. The relative risk was greater than 19.28. Human immunodeficiency-positive status was associated with other parameters: lower age and parity, major frequency of induced abortions, and sexually transmitted diseases. Thus although human immunodeficiency-positive status seems to be a true risk factor in relation to the altered immunologic state, an indirect association cannot be discarded. Such patients should be screened closely for human papillomavirus infection and cervical cancer. Among human immunodeficiency-positive women, a more resistant behavior of human papillomavirus-associated lesions was detected (recurrence-persistence of 41.7% versus 12%), a fact that might also be in relation to the immunodepressed status.

"Kinin/prostaglandin system: its therapeutic value in surgical stress. Multiple system organ failure as a consequence of injury or sepsis remains the major reason for death in critically ill patients. One of the treatment concepts that has recently attracted clinical attention is the administration of kinins and prostaglandins (PGs). On the basis of experimental data, there is reason to believe that these compounds may have the potential to manipulate favorably certain processes and mechanisms (such as inflammatory or ischemic reactions) thought to be important in the pathophysiology of surgical stress. However, thus far, information on those effects in humans is still scarce. On the other hand, administration of kinins and PGs is technically possible and can be performed safely, even in intensive care patients. Therefore, different techniques, effects, and side-effects of kinin/PG therapy deserve clinical testing. It remains to be seen whether this concept will be useful in the treatment of critically ill surgical patients. ",0
"Buerger's colour. Cyanosis of the hands and feet in Buerger's disease is known as 'Buerger's colour'. This characteristic skin colour is produced by the subpapillary venous plexus. The reactions of the subpapillary venous plexus in patients with Buerger's disease were observed by analysing the fractional blood volume of tissue using a visible light reflective spectrophotometer. Capillary morphology was investigated using an intravital video-microscopic system. Twenty-seven subjects, comprising 13 normals and 14 patients with Buerger's disease, were studied. In the nailbeds of patients with Buerger's disease, an increase in the number of loops, cyanotic colour change and dilatation were observed. In this condition there was incompetence of venular tonus and regurgitation at venular valves. Buerger's colour is probably due to excessive congestion of venous blood in the subpapillary venous plexus which is produced by these mechanisms. ",0
"Computed tomography-guided fine-needle aspiration of retroperitoneal lymph nodes in gynecologic oncology. Computed tomography-guided fine-needle aspiration was performed on 30 retroperitoneal lymph nodes in 29 patients with gynecologic cancer. There were no serious complications. Review of the cytologic material demonstrated malignant cells in 83% of the aspirates. Because the predictive value of a positive aspirate approaches 100%, therapy for metastatic disease can be initiated in these patients with the need for an open biopsy. Among five aspirates in which malignant cells were not seen, the cellularity of the specimen appeared to be the critical factor determining the predictive value of the aspirate. Whereas neither of two patients with negative aspirates of adequate cellularity has developed recurrent disease, two of three patients with hypocellular negative aspirates have. Because a hypocellular negative aspirate from a retroperitoneal lymph node may not be a true reflection of disease status, either repeat aspiration or open biopsy is advisable. ",0
"Causes of death in hospitalized intravenous drug abusers. The authors reviewed at autopsy the causes of death of 274 patients with evidence of intravenous drug abuse who had been admitted to a large public hospital. There were 127 who died from diseases unrelated to intravenous drug abuse, and in 41% of these, chronic alcoholism was implicated. Deaths from overdose syndromes and drug-related organ pathology comprised only 11% of all cases. The mean age at death was 39 years. There was a male/female ratio of 3.6:1. Half of all patients died from infection--72 from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) alone. These findings indicate that persons hospitalized with a history of intravenous drug abuse usually die from causes other than overdose and that AIDS and chronic alcoholism are significant problems. Emphasis should be placed upon detecting ""hidden"" intravenous drug deaths to provide more accurate statistical information. ",0
"Occult vascular malformations of the optic chiasm: magnetic resonance imaging diagnosis and surgical laser resection. Angiographically occult vascular malformations of the optic nerve and chiasm are extremely rare. Before the advent of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), it was difficult to diagnose these lesions preoperatively. We report MRI scan findings of optic chiasm cavernous angiomas in two patients with chiasmal syndrome. MRI was useful in localizing the vascular malformation and delineating its characteristics, especially chronic hemorrhage. One patient underwent biopsy of the lesion. The other patient underwent complete microsurgical resection of the malformation with the carbon dioxide laser with preservation of vision. Occult vascular malformations of the optic nerve and chiasm may be a more common cause of visual deterioration than previously recognized. The MRI scan is the imaging modality of choice for diagnosing and following these lesions. In certain patients, these vascular malformations may be amenable to complete surgical removal with stabilization or improvement of visual function. ",0
"Cone cerclage in pregnancy. We report a technique of cone cerclage and the results and outcome in 17 patients who required a diagnostic cone biopsy in pregnancy. The mean age of the patients was 30.6 years (range 21-41). The mean gestational age was 18.8 weeks (range 10-32) at the time of the procedure. There were no major complications and hemorrhage was not a significant problem. There were no second-trimester abortions. Two patients required beta-sympathomimetics to suppress uterine activity for longer than 24 hours after the procedure. Six patients had invasive carcinoma, nine had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) III, and two had CIN II. In 14 cases, the endocervical and ectocervical margins were negative; two patients with CIN and one with multifocal microinvasion had positive margins. Cone cerclage is a safe and easy method for performing diagnostic cervical conization during pregnancy. ",0
"Regression of the left main trunk lesion by steroid administration in Takayasu's aortitis. A 62-year-old man with unstable angina due to severe narrowing of the left main trunk (LMT) was examined. Emergency bypass surgery was performed with an internal mammary artery graft, instead of a saphenous vein graft, because of the thickened, edematous ascending aorta. Postoperative coronary angiography showed the lesion of the LMT markedly regressing. Presumably, this stenotic lesion of the LMT was caused by active aortitis and was partially reversible by steroid administration both during and after surgery. Steroid therapy can be added to the list of treatments for cases of LMT disease associated with Takayasu's aortitis, if signs of active inflammation are present. ",0
Successful control of bleeding from gastric antral vascular ectasia (watermelon stomach) by laser photocoagulation. We report a case of gastric antral vascular ectasia in a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis in whom chronic blood loss was a major problem. She required repeated blood transfusions that were complicated by reactions and still had persistent anaemia. She was treated with laser phototherapy in the form of quadrantic photocoagulation with a neodynium yttrium-aluminium-garnet laser. This greatly improved the endoscopic appearance of the gastric lesions and effectively controlled blood loss. She required no further transfusions. Bleeding recurred after 11 months which was controlled by further laser photocoagulation. ,0
"Fusiform dilatations of the carotid artery following radical surgery of childhood craniopharyngiomas. Between 1982 and 1990, a series of 31 children with craniopharyngiomas underwent initial surgery at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia with an attempt at total tumor removal. Nine (29%) of them were found to have fusiform dilatation of the supraclinoid carotid artery either at the time of surgery for recurrence (one patient) or on routine surveillance with enhanced computerized tomography 6 to 18 months postoperatively (eight patients). The finding of carotid enlargement was confirmed in seven cases with magnetic resonance angiography and in one case with a formal arteriogram. Eight of the nine patients remain alive at a mean of 3.7 years after diagnosis. None have experienced hemorrhage or other symptoms referrable to fusiform dilatation of the carotid artery, which is believed to result from surgical manipulation of the carotid artery. ",0
Endoscopic treatment of biliary tract strictures in sclerosing cholangitis: a larger series and recommendations for treatment. We report a group of 35 patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis who had long-term follow-up after endoscopic treatment of major ductal strictures in the primary or secondary biliary ducts. Our patients were all symptomatic with ascending cholangitis or jaundice. There was significant improvement as measured by clinical parameters of hospitalization rates and laboratory data and comparable radiography. Long-term follow-up averaged 24 (+/- 2.8 months). We believe endoscopic treatment of sclerosing cholangitis should be attempted in selected symptomatic cases with major ductal strictures before liver transplantation. ,0
"IgG and IgA antibodies to the collagen-like region of C1q in rheumatoid vasculitis. We investigated the presence of IgG and IgA antibodies to C1q in serum samples from 80 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 31 patients with rheumatoid vasculitis, and 80 healthy controls. IgG and IgA antibodies to C1q, as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, were found in less than 5% of the sera from RA patients and from healthy controls. In contrast, IgG and IgA antibodies to C1q were found in 29% and 61%, respectively, of the sera from patients with rheumatoid vasculitis. The occurrence of IgA antibodies to C1q has not been previously demonstrated. These results also demonstrate that IgG antibodies to C1q do not occur exclusively in systemic lupus erythematosus patients: Sera of patients with rheumatoid vasculitis frequently contain IgG or IgA antibodies to C1q, which contribute to immune complex formation.

"Ventricular responses to mental stress testing in patients with coronary artery disease. Pathophysiological implications. Recent research examining the effects of mental stress on left ventricular wall motion and/or ejection fraction has used four techniques to measure contractile function: radionuclide ventriculography, a stationary nuclear probe, two-dimensional echocardiography, and an ambulatory radionuclide left ventricular function monitor. This research has consistently revealed that mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia occurs frequently during laboratory stress testing, particularly among patients with exercise-induced ischemia. This ischemia is usually silent, occurs at low heart rate elevations but with significant blood pressure increases compared with exercise-induced ischemia, and is frequently not detected when electrocardiographic markers are used alone. Exploration of factors underlying differences between mental stress- and exercise-induced ischemia has provided a means for studying the complex pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia. ",0
"Immunoglobulins A, G, and M to cytomegalovirus during recurrent infection in recipients of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Occurrence and significance of specific IgA and IgM to cytomegalovirus (CMV) in recurrent CMV infection was evaluated in 21 allogeneic T lymphocyte-depleted bone marrow transplantation (BMT) recipients who had been previously CMV seropositive. Of 17 patients with CMV infection, viruria was detected in 94%, CMV-specific IgA in 88% and IgM in 76%, and a fourfold rise in IgG in 65%. The median time between BMT and detection of viruria was 69 days, of IgA 70, of IgM 62, and of IgG 88 days. The IgM and IgA responses lasted for 14 and 30 days (median time), whereas high IgG titers persisted. Twelve patients developed CMV disease; in these the appearance of viruria, IgA, and IgM preceded the rise of IgG (P less than .02). CMV-specific IgA and IgM are valuable diagnostic tools in BMT recipients with recurrent CMV infection. ",0
"Efficacy of doxazosin in specific hypertensive patient groups. In practice, some of the major problems for the physician who treats hypertension are patients who are resistant to treatment or who have other complicating risk syndromes. Therefore the overall efficacy of an antihypertensive agent must include an assessment of effect in patients with serious ancillary problems. In this article, doxazosin is reviewed for its efficacy in the treatment of severe essential hypertension and specific complications or conditions of mild or moderate essential hypertension, namely, left ventricular hypertrophy, hyperlipidemia, noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, renal insufficiency, pheochromocytoma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peripheral vascular disease, and smoking. Doxazosin is particularly efficacious in many specific subgroups of patients with hypertension, and the results of relevant studies are discussed. ",0
"Traumatic and spontaneous extracranial internal carotid artery dissections. Seventy patients with spontaneous and 21 with traumatic extracranial internal carotid artery dissections were studied clinically and angiographically with mean follow-ups of 64 (spontaneous group) and 40 months (traumatic group). Sixty percent of the patients in the spontaneous group and 71% in the traumatic group also had follow-up angiograms. In traumatic dissections aneurysms were common, significantly fewer aneurysms resolved or became smaller and fewer stenoses resolved or improved, whereas more stenoses progressed to occlusion. Traumatic dissections were more likely to leave the patients with neurological deficits. A significantly higher percentage of the patients with spontaneous dissections were asymptomatic at follow-up compared with the traumatic group. Although both spontaneous and traumatic dissections of extracranial internal carotid arteries mostly carry a good prognosis, the outcome may be somewhat less favorable for the traumatic group. ",0
"Partial laryngectomy after irradiation failure. Forty-three patients who had partial laryngectomies after radiotherapy were evaluated. Forty-two had failed irradiation for laryngeal carcinoma. Nine had supraglottic procedures, 3 endoscopic, and 31 vertical partial. Twelve (28%) required subsequent completion laryngectomy. Major complications included laryngeal stenosis in 1, incompetent laryngeal sphincters in 2, mucocutaneous fistulas in 3, and delayed deglutition in 3. Six patients had positive permanent section margins. In 5 of those, intraoperative frozen sections had been taken and were negative. Recurrent or persistent disease was eventually demonstrated in all patients with positive margins. The 2-year determinant disease-free survival rate for stage I and II disease was 85%. Three-year disease-free survival was 50% for stage III and IV disease. Partial laryngectomies, including supraglottic, can be done after irradiation failure with a high expectation of cure and acceptable morbidity. Immediate additional operation should be considered in patients with positive margins. ",0
"Magnetic resonance imaging of experimental rat brain tumors: histopathological evaluation. Using RG-C6 glioma-transplanted rats, we studied precontrast and postcontrast magnetic resonance imaging, extravasation of Evans blue, and histology. In all rats, tumor was enhanced with gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA). The necrotic portion in the tumor, however, was not enhanced. Hemorrhage and hydrocephalus were clearly visualized on both the precontrast and postcontrast images. Blood-brain barrier-disrupted areas stained with Evans blue and areas enhanced with Gd-DTPA on magnetic resonance imaging were nearly consistent. It is suggested that the mechanism of brain tumor enhancement with Gd-DTPA on magnetic resonance imaging is simply related to the degree of alteration of the blood-brain barrier. The Gd-DTPA-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, even with low magnetic field, is useful for the evaluation of size, shape, and location of experimental rat brain tumors. ",0
"Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. A clinical case series of 21 patients. New Mexico Eosinophilia-Myalgia Syndrome Study Group. We reviewed 21 cases of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome to describe the range of clinical findings in these patients. Most patients were women (20 [95%]) and middle-aged (mean, 46 years) and had taken the food supplement L-tryptophan (95%). All cases involved eosinophilia (eosinophil count, greater than or equal to 2.0 x 10(9)/L) and incapacitating myalgias. Fourteen (88%) of the 16 patients tested had mild liver function abnormalities. Aldolase levels were abnormal in all patients tested. Muscle biopsies were done in five patients; four showed eosinophilic perimyositis, and one had interstitial inflammation. No physical finding was pathognomonic or universal, but muscle tenderness, tachycardia, and rash were the most common signs found during physical examinations. Seven patients were treated with prednisone, and six showed improvement in muscle pain and a decrease in eosinophilia. The cause of this disorder is still unknown. ",0
"Ichthyosis, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, impaired neutrophil chemotaxis, growth retardation, and metaphyseal dysplasia (Shwachman syndrome). Report of a case with extensive skin lesions (clinical, histological, and ultrastructural findings). The Shwachman syndrome comprises exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, growth retardation, and bone marrow hypoplasia resulting in neutropenia. Clinical, morphological, and ultrastructural studies, as well as hair analysis, were performed in a patient with Shwachman's syndrome and severe ichthyosis. Clinical findings were lamellar ichthyosiform desquamation on the extremities. The hair was scanty and short on the scalp, in the eyelashes, and in the eyebrows. The nails were hyperkeratotic. Morphologic findings were slight, regular acanthosis and severe diffuse hyperkeratosis with variable parakeratosis. The granular layer was thickened. The papillary dermis showed very slight perivascular lymphocyte infiltration. The most prominent ultrastructural finding was the presence of solitary or multiple droplets of varying size in the cytoplasm of the keratinocytes. Hair analysis revealed no abnormalities; the cystine concentration in hair specimens was normal. ",0
"mtDNA depletion with variable tissue expression: a novel genetic abnormality in mitochondrial diseases. We studied two related infants with a fatal mitochondrial disease, affecting muscle in one and liver in the other. Quantitative analysis revealed a severe depletion of mtDNA in affected tissues. This genetic abnormality was also observed in muscle of an unrelated infant with myopathy and in muscle and kidney of a fourth child with myopathy and nephropathy. Biochemistry, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization showed that the depletion of mtDNA in muscle fibers was correlated with a respiratory chain defect and with lack of mitochondrially translated proteins. Although the differential tissue involvement in these infants suggests mtDNA heteroplasmy, sequence analysis of mtDNA replication origins did not reveal any abnormality that could account for the low copy number.

"SPECT imaging of pediatric brain tumor with hexakis (methoxyisobutylisonitrile) technetium (I). Technetium-99m-Hexamibi [Hexakis (methoxyisobutylisonitrile) technetium (i)] was developed as a myocardial perfusion agent with biologic properties similar to those of thallium-201 (201TI). As 201TI has recently been observed to be of value for the diagnosis of brain tumors when used in conjunction with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging technology, the possibility that the biologic similarity of the two radiopharmaceuticals extended to their affinity for tumors was tested. A 5-yr-old female patient with a brain stem astrocytoma showed marked focal uptake of 99mTc-Hexamibi at the site of tumor recurrence as defined by biopsy and prior 201TI/SPECT study. Tumor-to-normal cortex radioactivity ratios for the 99mTc-Hexamibi/SPECT study were 132:1 and the spatial resolution of the 99mTc-Hexamibi images was high. This observation suggests that 99mTc-Hexamibi merits further study as a potential agent for SPECT imaging of human brain tumors. ",0
"Pulmonary acinar development in diaphragmatic hernia. Pulmonary acinar development was assessed in 17 autopsy cases of pulmonary hypoplasia associated with diaphragmatic hernia. Morphologic examination was conducted by light and electron microscopy, and morphometric study was achieved by radial alveolar count and biochemical quantitation of surfactant phospholipid. In most cases of unilateral diaphragmatic hernia, the ipsilateral lung was underdeveloped morphologically and biochemically compared with the contralateral lung. However, both ipsilateral and contralateral lungs were well developed in some cases of unilateral diaphragmatic hernia. Thus, acinar development of hypoplastic lung in diaphragmatic hernia is varied. The influence of other conditions, such as oligohydramnios, polyhydramnios, and other anomalies that may influence retention of lung fluid or fetal respiratory movement, should be considered to assess the acinar development of hypoplastic lung in diaphragmatic hernia.

"Developmental dysmnesia in a poor reader. A 22-yr-old subject with moderate developmental dyslexia experienced poor memory from an early age. In spite of normal intelligence he had great difficulty in learning historical and geographical names, mathematical formulae, poems and songs, and verbal series such as the letters of the alphabet and the months of the year. His recognition of familiar faces was also faulty at times. A battery of memory tests confirmed a moderate deficit of verbal as well as visual memory, whereas spatial memory was preserved. Other cognitive functions were intact, except for a mild reading disability. No evidence of brain pathology was provided by his history, neurological examination and CT scanning. ",0
"Treatment of vaginal candidiasis: orally or vaginally? Vaginal candidiasis continues to be the most common cause of vaginal discharge. A large variety of topical drugs and a selection of orally active antifungals are currently available. The choice between the use of oral drugs or intravaginal agents will depend on the therapeutic results obtained with the different agents, side effects, pregnancy status, and patient preference. The results obtained in the Maria Hospital, Tilburg, The Netherlands, and a review of foreign data suggest the following: (1) For acute infection oral and topical agents produce equivalent results. (2) For chronic infections oral medication is preferred. (3) Oral therapy should not be given to pregnant patients or to patients not using reliable contraceptive measures. (4) Half the patients prefer oral medication; only 5% prefer intravaginal therapy, and the others had no clear preference. ",0
"Pseudocyst of the auricle: successful treatment with intracartilaginous trichloroacetic acid and button bolsters. Pseudocyst of the auricle is an asymptomatic, noninflammatory cystic swelling that typically involves the anthelix of the ear and results from an accumulation of fluid within an unlined intracartilaginous cavity. We report a patient with a recurrent pseudocyst of the auricle and describe a new surgical technique for treating this condition by applying 50% trichloroacetic acid to the intracartilaginous cavity and utilizing external button bolsters for compressive therapy. This therapeutic approach is simple to perform in the office, results in permanent resolution of the pseudocyst, preserves the normal architecture of the external ear, and provides excellent postoperative and long-term cosmetic results.

"Immunohistochemical demonstration of pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor in normal and neoplastic colonic mucosa. Specimens of normal and neoplastic colonic mucosa from 52 patients were analysed by immunohistochemistry using a monospecific polyclonal antiserum against human pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (PSTI). In normal colonic mucosa PSTI was found in the goblet cells in the basal parts of the crypts. In adenomas of tubular, villous, and tubulo-villous types PSTI was also found in the upper parts of the polyps, usually occurring in the regeneration zone. There was a more intense staining reaction in polyps with increased atypia. Carcinomas of different types and of various grades of differentiation and of in situ type did not contain PSTI. These findings indicate that PSTI could be a marker for adenomatous rather than carcinomatous epithelium in the colon. Furthermore, the absence of the inhibitor in malignant cells might facilitate tissue invasion by malignant cells because of deficient protease inhibition. ",0
"Enveloping the bladder with displacement of flap of the rectus abdominis muscle for the treatment of neurogenic bladder. Neurogenic bladder is a frequent occurrence. A new surgical technique has been designed and was used successfully in 18 patients with ideal results. The key point of the operation is to turn over a flap of rectus abdominis muscle to envelop the bladder. Contraction of the muscle flap and the abdominal muscles would enhance voiding ability. In the meantime, the bladder is displaced forward and the resultant change in the bladder-posterior urethral angle also favors voiding. Since the bladder is near the anterior abdominal wall manual compression during voiding is made easier. All of these advantages greatly facilitate voiding. ",0
"Percutaneous urinary diversion in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer. The efficacy of percutaneous urinary diversion was evaluated in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer. A total of 84 patients underwent the procedure between 2005 and 2010. The most common indication for urinary diversion was urinary obstruction. The procedure was successful in relieving urinary symptoms in 78% of patients. Complications included urinary tract infection, stent blockage, and ureteral stricture. Patients who received adjuvant radiotherapy had a significantly higher rate of complications. Mean survival time after the procedure was 14 months. Percutaneous urinary diversion provides effective relief of urinary symptoms in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer, however, it is associated with a risk of complications that should be carefully considered in the management of these patients.",1
"Histologic evaluation of the larynx in sudden infant death syndrome. Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is a devastating condition that claims the lives of seemingly healthy infants. In an effort to better understand the pathogenesis of SIDS, we conducted a histologic evaluation of the larynx in SIDS cases. We found that a significant number of SIDS cases showed abnormalities in the larynx, including inflammation, edema, and epithelial cell necrosis. These findings suggest that the larynx may play a role in the pathophysiology of SIDS. Furthermore, we observed a correlation between the severity of laryngeal abnormalities and the age of the infant at the time of death, with younger infants exhibiting more pronounced changes. This information sheds light on the potential involvement of the larynx in SIDS and may contribute to future efforts in preventing this tragic syndrome.",1
"Immunohistologic properties of benign and malignant mixed tumor of the lacrimal gland. Benign and malignant mixed tumors of the lacrimal gland are rare neoplasms that exhibit varied immunohistologic characteristics. In this study, we aim to evaluate the immunohistologic properties of these tumors to improve their diagnosis and management. We analyzed the expression of cytokeratins (CK), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), Ki-67 proliferation antigen, and the presence of specific genetic mutations in a cohort of patients with lacrimal gland mixed tumors. Our results showed that CK7 and CK20 were differentially expressed in benign and malignant tumors, with CK7 showing higher expression in benign tumors and CK20 showing higher expression in malignant tumors. EMA was strongly expressed in both benign and malignant tumors. The Ki-67 proliferation antigen was significantly higher in malignant tumors compared to benign tumors, indicating increased cell proliferation. Additionally, specific genetic mutations, such as PLAG1 and CTNNB1, were found in a subset of malignant tumors, suggesting their potential role in tumor progression. In conclusion, our study reveals distinct immunohistologic properties of benign and malignant mixed tumors of the lacrimal gland, providing valuable insights for their accurate diagnosis and targeted therapy.",1
"Collagen metabolism in gynecologic patients: changes in the concentration of the aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen in serum. Patients with gynecologic conditions often experience changes in collagen metabolism. This study aimed to investigate the concentration of the aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen (PIIINP) in serum as a marker of collagen metabolism in gynecologic patients. Serum samples were collected from 50 patients with gynecologic conditions and 50 healthy controls. The PIIINP levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results showed that the serum PIIINP levels were significantly higher in gynecologic patients compared to healthy controls (p < 0.001). Additionally, the PIIINP levels were significantly elevated in patients with advanced stage gynecologic cancer compared to those with early-stage disease (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that collagen metabolism is altered in gynecologic patients, particularly in those with advanced disease. Measurement of serum PIIINP levels may serve as a useful biomarker for monitoring collagen metabolism in gynecologic conditions.",1
"Elevated soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels in patients with active multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation and demyelination in the central nervous system. Dysregulation of cytokines has been implicated in the pathogenesis of MS. Interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) plays a crucial role in immune activation and has been linked to MS. In this study, we aimed to investigate the levels of soluble IL-2R (sIL-2R) in patients with active MS. We recruited 50 patients with active MS and 50 healthy controls. Serum levels of sIL-2R were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Our results showed significantly elevated levels of sIL-2R in patients with active MS compared to healthy controls (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the levels of sIL-2R correlated positively with disease severity as assessed by the Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (r = 0.45, p < 0.01). These findings suggest that sIL-2R may serve as a potential biomarker for disease activity in MS and provide insights into its pathophysiology.",1
"Further evaluation of radical surgery following radiotherapy for advanced parotid carcinoma. The effectiveness of radical surgery after radiotherapy for advanced parotid carcinoma was evaluated. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 58 patients who underwent radical surgery following radiotherapy for advanced parotid carcinoma. The patients were divided into two groups based on the interval between radiotherapy and surgery: group 1 with an interval of less than 6 months and group 2 with an interval of 6 months or more. The overall survival rate, disease-free survival rate, and complications were compared between the two groups. The results showed that group 1 had a significantly higher overall survival rate and disease-free survival rate compared to group 2. However, the complication rate was higher in group 1. Based on these findings, it is suggested that radical surgery performed within 6 months after radiotherapy can improve the overall survival and disease-free survival rates in patients with advanced parotid carcinoma, although it may increase the risk of complications. Further studies are needed to validate these results.",1

"Pressor systems in hypertension and congestive heart failure. This review examines the pressor systems involved in hypertension and congestive heart failure (CHF). Both conditions are characterized by increased sympathetic activity, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activation, and endothelin production. In hypertension, sympathetic activity is elevated, leading to increased peripheral vascular resistance and blood pressure. The RAAS is also stimulated, causing vasoconstriction and sodium retention. Endothelin, a potent vasoconstrictor, is upregulated in hypertensive patients. In CHF, there is sympathetic overactivation due to reduced cardiac output and baroreceptor dysfunction, leading to vasoconstriction and fluid retention. The RAAS is also activated in CHF, resulting in salt and water retention. Increased endothelin levels are observed in CHF patients, contributing to vasoconstriction. Understanding the pathophysiology of these pressor systems is crucial for developing targeted therapies to manage hypertension and CHF. Further research is needed to investigate potential therapeutic interventions that can modulate these systems to improve patient outcomes.",1
"A dentist's dilemma: nonsurgical endodontic therapy or periapical surgery for teeth with apparent pulpal pathosis and an associated periapical radiolucent lesion. This study examines the dilemma faced by dentists in choosing between nonsurgical endodontic therapy and periapical surgery for teeth displaying pulpal pathosis and a periapical radiolucent lesion. Nonsurgical endodontic therapy is a conservative approach that aims to preserve the natural tooth through root canal treatment, eliminating the need for surgery. Periapical surgery, on the other hand, involves removing the periapical lesion and addressing any underlying issues directly. The decision to choose between these two treatment options can be challenging, as both have their advantages and drawbacks. Factors influencing this decision include the size and location of the lesion, the condition of the tooth structure, and the individual patient's preferences and expectations.

"Steroids induce acetylcholine receptors on cultured human muscle: implications for myasthenia gravis. The effects of steroids on the induction of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) on cultured human muscle cells were investigated in this study, with implications for myasthenia gravis (MG). Primary cultures of human skeletal muscle cells were exposed to various concentrations of dexamethasone or prednisolone for different durations. The expression of AChRs was then assessed using immunocytochemistry and electrophysiological techniques. Results showed that both steroids significantly increased AChR expression on cultured human muscle cells. The effect was dose-dependent and persisted even after steroid withdrawal. Furthermore, the induction of AChR expression was similar in both dexamethasone and prednisolone-treated cells. These findings suggest a potential mechanism of action for steroids in the treatment of MG, a neuromuscular autoimmune disorder characterized by reduced AChR levels. The induction of AChR expression by steroids may help restore neuromuscular transmission and improve muscle strength in patients with MG.

Congenital angiotropic lymphoma, also known as intravascular lymphomatosis, is a rare and aggressive form of lymphoma primarily involving small blood vessels. We present a case of congenital angiotropic lymphoma of the T-cell type. This case involves a 25-year-old female patient who presented with fever, weight loss, and multiple skin lesions. Biopsy of the skin lesions confirmed the diagnosis of intravascular lymphomatosis, and subsequent immunophenotyping revealed a T-cell subtype. The patient was treated with a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Despite early intervention, the patient showed only a partial response to treatment and succumbed to the disease. This case highlights the aggressive nature of congenital angiotropic lymphoma and the importance of early diagnosis and multidisciplinary management. Further research is needed to better understand the pathogenesis and optimal treatment strategies for this rare and challenging malignancy.",1
"Lack of change in neurochemical markers during the postepileptic phase of intrahippocampal tetanus toxin syndrome in rats. Intrahippocampal tetanus toxin (Ttx) administration in rats induces a postepileptic phase characterized by behavioral changes and neurochemical alterations. This study aimed to investigate the changes in neurochemical markers during the postepileptic phase of Ttx syndrome. Thirty-two rats were divided into Ttx and control groups, and Ttx was injected into the right hippocampus. Behavioral assessments were conducted for 8 weeks post-injection. Neurochemical markers, including glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), dopamine, and serotonin, were measured in the hippocampus and cortex using high-performance liquid chromatography. Compared to controls, Ttx-treated rats exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior and decreased locomotor activity during the postepileptic phase. However, there were no significant changes in the levels of glutamate, GABA, dopamine, or serotonin in either brain region. These findings suggest that while Ttx administration induces behavioral changes associated with the postepileptic phase in rats, there are no significant alterations in the levels of key neurochemical markers. Further investigations are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the postepileptic phase in Ttx syndrome.",1

"Complications in percutaneous transluminal angioplasty: relationships with patient age.  Five hundred consecutive attempted lower limb angioplasties for ischaemic disease (370 patients, mean age 65. The study aimed to determine the relationship between complications in percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and patient age. Five hundred cases of lower limb angioplasties were examined in 370 patients with ischaemic disease, who had a mean age of 65.3 years. The overall complication rate was 9.2%. The most common complications were dissection (3.8%), thrombosis (2.6%), and perforation (1.8%). Patients aged 65 years or older had a significantly higher rate of complications compared to younger patients (11.3% vs. 6.5%, p<0.05). Age was found to be an independent predictor of complications in PTA after adjusting for other confounding factors. The study provides evidence that older patients undergoing lower limb angioplasty for ischaemic disease are at a higher risk of complications, highlighting the importance of careful consideration and evaluation in this patient population.",1
"Hepatic arterial embolization in cases of extensive celiac arterial stenosis. Hepatic arterial embolization (HAE) is a well-established treatment for hepatic malignancies. However, there is limited evidence on the use of HAE in cases of extensive celiac arterial stenosis (CAS). This case series presents four patients with extensive CAS who underwent HAE for management of liver tumors. All patients had previously undergone unsuccessful attempts at revascularization. HAE was performed using polyvinyl alcohol particles and/or microspheres. The technical success rate was 100%, with complete occlusion of the CAS achieved in all cases. Clinical follow-up at a median of 12 months showed improvement in liver function and tumor response in all patients. HAE appears to be a safe and effective treatment option for patients with extensive CAS, providing a viable alternative when revascularization is not feasible or unsuccessful.",1
"Gallbladder carcinoma producing human chorionic gonadotropin. Gallbladder carcinoma is a rare malignancy and its association with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) production is even more uncommon. We present a case of a 59-year-old man who presented with symptoms of right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, and weight loss. Imaging studies revealed a mass in the gallbladder with liver involvement. Laboratory investigations showed markedly elevated levels of hCG. A diagnosis of gallbladder carcinoma producing hCG was made based on histopathological examination. The patient underwent surgical resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Despite treatment, the patient's prognosis remained poor, and he succumbed to the disease within a year of diagnosis. This case serves as a reminder of the rare association between gallbladder carcinoma and hCG production, highlighting the need for appropriate diagnostic evaluation and management in such cases.",1

"Hemodynamic determinants of vascular changes in hypertension and atherosclerosis.  Several new concepts are reviewed concerning structural and functional changes in atherosclerotic and hypertensive blood vessels. This review focuses on the hemodynamic determinants of vascular changes in hypertension and atherosclerosis. It examines several new concepts related to the structural and functional alterations observed in atherosclerotic and hypertensive blood vessels. In hypertension, a decrease in endothelium-dependent vasodilation and an increase in endothelium-derived contracting factors contribute to impaired vascular function. Additionally, increased shear stress and altered wall tension affect vascular remodeling and the development of atherosclerotic plaques. In atherosclerosis, abnormal endothelial function, increased oxidative stress, and inflammation play crucial roles in the initiation and progression of the disease. Understanding the hemodynamic factors underlying these vascular changes is essential for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting hypertension and atherosclerosis. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the complex interaction between hemodynamics and vascular alterations in these conditions.",1
"Absent or minimal cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities in Haemophilus influenzae meningitis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings in patients with Haemophilus influenzae meningitis. A total of 50 patients were included in the study, and CSF samples were collected from all of them. Contrary to previous reports, our findings revealed that the majority of patients (96%) had either absent or minimal CSF abnormalities. Only 2 patients (4%) showed evidence of increased CSF protein levels, and none had pleocytosis. This finding challenges the traditional belief that Haemophilus influenzae meningitis is associated with significant CSF abnormalities. It suggests that CSF analysis may not be a reliable method for diagnosing this type of meningitis. Further research is needed to better understand the pathophysiology of Haemophilus influenzae meningitis and to identify more accurate diagnostic methods. This knowledge will be crucial in improving the management and outcomes of patients with this condition.",1

"Narrow QRS ventricular tachycardia.  OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency and clinical characteristics of narrow QRS ventricular tachycardia (QRS duration less than or equal to 0. 11 seconds). Narrow QRS ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a rare form of VT with a QRS duration of equal to or less than 0.11 seconds. This study aims to determine the frequency and clinical characteristics of this specific type of VT. A retrospective analysis of medical records was conducted on patients with VT admitted to a tertiary care hospital over a 5-year period. Among a total of 500 patients with VT, 22 cases (4.4%) of narrow QRS VT were identified. The mean age of these patients was 51.8 years, and the majority were male (72.7%). The most common underlying cardiac pathology was ischemic heart disease (54.5%), followed by non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (27.3%). Narrow QRS VT was often recurrent (59.1%) and typically presented with symptoms of palpitations (68.2%) and presyncope/syncope (50%). Electrophysiological studies were performed in 18 patients (81.8%), and ventricular programmed stimulation was positive for sustained VT in 16 cases (88.9%).

In this study, we investigated the efficacy of noncontact transscleral Nd:YAG cyclophotocoagulation for the treatment of 40 eyes in 40 patients. The aim was to compare the results and outcomes of treatment using different laser placements: 1.5 mm from the limbus (group A) and 3 mm from the limbus (group B). 

The intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction achieved at 1 month follow-up was similar in both groups (group A: 4.5 +/- 1.2 mmHg, group B: 4.1 +/- 0.9 mmHg). No statistically significant difference was found between the two groups in terms of IOP reduction or occurrence of complications. 

Our findings suggest that both 1.5 mm and 3 mm laser placements in noncontact Nd:YAG cyclophotocoagulation are equally effective in reducing IOP in patients with glaucoma. Therefore, the choice of laser placement can be decided based on surgeon preference and anatomical considerations.",1
"Evaluation of vigabatrin as an add-on drug in the management of severe epilepsy.  The effects of the addition of Vigabatrin, a new anti-epileptic drug, to the therapy of 128 patients with severe medically refractory epilepsy is reported. This study evaluated the efficacy of adding Vigabatrin, a new anti-epileptic drug, to the treatment regimen of 128 patients with severe medically refractory epilepsy. The patients' response to the drug was assessed based on seizure frequency and severity.

Approximately 70% of patients experienced a greater than 50% reduction in seizure frequency, and 35% achieved seizure freedom. Adverse effects were reported in 26% of patients, with the most common being visual disturbances. Overall, Vigabatrin demonstrated effectiveness as an add-on therapy for severe epilepsy, providing improved seizure control and potential for seizure freedom in a significant proportion of patients.",1
"Environmental risk factors in siblings with Parkinson's disease. This study aimed to investigate environmental risk factors in siblings with Parkinson's disease (PD). A total of 235 PD patients with at least one affected sibling were recruited, along with 235 age- and sex-matched controls. Environmental risk factors, including smoking, exposure to pesticides and solvents, head trauma, and rural living, were assessed through structured interviews. Logistic regression analysis revealed that PD patients had a higher frequency of ever smoking (odds ratio [OR] = 1.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07-2.68), exposure to pesticides (OR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.13-2.84), and rural living (OR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.08-2.71) compared to controls. However, there was no significant association between PD and exposure to solvents or head trauma. These findings suggest that smoking, exposure to pesticides, and rural living may be potential environmental risk factors for PD in individuals with affected siblings.

This case highlights the importance of considering uncommon differential diagnoses for urethral lesions, as periurethral colonic-type polyps can closely resemble urethral caruncles. Awareness of this entity can prevent unnecessary interventions or misdiagnosis. Further studies are needed to determine the etiology and optimal management of periurethral colonic-type polyps.",1
"Oxidation reactions in Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Oxidative stress is known to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. We reviewed the literature to examine the involvement of oxidation reactions in the development and progression of this disease. Various studies have reported increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased levels of antioxidants in the brains of Parkinson's patients. Furthermore, markers of oxidative damage, such as lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation, were found to be elevated in these patients. Animal models of Parkinson's disease have also demonstrated increased oxidative stress and neurodegeneration. Additionally, genetic mutations that contribute to familial forms of Parkinson's have been linked to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. These findings suggest that oxidation reactions play a critical role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Targeting oxidative stress pathways may therefore be a promising therapeutic approach for this debilitating disorder.",1

"A comparative study of terbinafine versus griseofulvin in 'dry-type' dermatophyte infections. Dermatophyte infections, also known as ringworm, are commonly treated with antifungal medications such as terbinafine and griseofulvin. However, there is limited evidence comparing the efficacy of these medications in ""dry-type"" dermatophyte infections, which present with scaly and red skin lesions. In this comparative study, 100 patients with dry-type dermatophyte infections were randomly assigned to either terbinafine or griseofulvin treatment for 4 weeks. Clinical assessment and mycological evaluations were conducted at baseline and at the end of treatment. Results showed that both terbinafine and griseofulvin were effective in improving clinical symptoms and eradicating the fungal infection. However, terbinafine was significantly more effective, with a higher mycological cure rate compared to griseofulvin. Additionally, terbinafine had a lower relapse rate and shorter treatment duration. These findings suggest that terbinafine is the preferred treatment option for dry-type dermatophyte infections, providing a more rapid and durable response.",1
"Degenerative lesions in the articular cartilage after meniscectomy: preliminary experimental study in dogs. A preliminary experimental study in dogs investigates the degenerative lesions in the articular cartilage following meniscectomy. The study finds that meniscectomy results in progressive degenerative changes in the articular cartilage over time. The lesions are characterized by fibrillation, ulceration, and loss of cartilage thickness. These changes are more pronounced in weight-bearing areas of the joint. The study concludes that meniscectomy may lead to accelerated degenerative joint disease and recommends caution in performing this procedure. The findings highlight the importance of preserving the meniscus whenever possible to minimize the risk of subsequent articular cartilage degeneration and the development of osteoarthritis. Further research is needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms and potential interventions to prevent or mitigate these degenerative changes.",1
"The use of bromodeoxyuridine cytokinetic studies as a prognostic indicator of cancer of the head and neck. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) cytokinetic studies have shown promise in predicting the prognosis of cancer of the head and neck. In a retrospective analysis of 100 patients, BrdU labeling index (LI) was found to be significantly associated with disease recurrence and overall survival. Patients with a high BrdU LI had a higher risk of recurrence and shorter overall survival compared to those with a low BrdU LI. Additionally, BrdU LI correlated with tumor grade and stage, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker. Further studies are warranted to validate the use of BrdU cytokinetic studies as a tool for personalized treatment decisions in head and neck cancer.",1

The long-term follow-up showed a low recurrence rate, suggesting favorable outcomes of surgical treatment for benign parotid tumors.",1
"Serum lipids and lipoproteins are less powerful predictors of extracranial carotid artery atherosclerosis than are cigarette smoking and hypertension The effect of serum lipids and lipoproteins on extracranial carotid artery atherosclerosis (CAS) was studied in patients who underwent carotid arteriography. This study aimed to investigate the association between serum lipids and lipoproteins and extracranial carotid artery atherosclerosis (CAS) compared to other risk factors such as cigarette smoking and hypertension. Carotid arteriography was performed on patients to determine the presence and severity of CAS. Serum lipid and lipoprotein levels were measured in these patients. Statistical analysis revealed that cigarette smoking and hypertension were stronger predictors of CAS compared to serum lipids and lipoproteins. Additionally, when adjusting for other risk factors, serum cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol showed a weak association with CAS, while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol showed a protective effect. These findings suggest that serum lipids and lipoproteins have a limited impact on extracranial CAS development, with cigarette smoking and hypertension playing a more significant role.",1
"Evidence of a local immune activation in cystic brain tumors. A study was conducted to investigate the presence of local immune activation in cystic brain tumors. Tissue samples were obtained from 42 patients with cystic brain tumors and analyzed for the expression of immune markers. The results showed a significant upregulation of immune markers, including CD3, CD4, and CD8 T cells, as well as CD68 macrophages, within the cystic fluid of the tumors compared to normal brain tissue. Additionally, an increased expression of cytokines, such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, was observed. These findings indicate a localized immune response within cystic brain tumors, suggesting the involvement of immune cells in the pathogenesis and progression of these tumors. Further exploration of immune-based therapies may be warranted for the treatment of cystic brain tumors.",1
"Selection of patients with stage B prostate cancer for radical prostatectomy.  There are several areas of concern in dealing with clinical stage B disease. Deciding on the appropriate treatment for patients with clinical stage B prostate cancer remains a challenge. This study aimed to identify factors that could help select patients for radical prostatectomy. A total of 168 patients with clinical stage B disease were included in the analysis. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, Gleason score, age, and clinical symptoms were evaluated. It was found that PSA levels greater than 20 ng/ml and Gleason scores greater than 7 were significant indicators for selecting patients for radical prostatectomy. Age and clinical symptoms did not contribute significantly to the decision-making process. These findings suggest that PSA levels and Gleason scores can provide valuable information in determining the appropriateness of radical prostatectomy in patients with stage B prostate cancer.",1
"A new syndrome: hearing loss and familial salivary gland insensitivity to aldosterone in two brothers.  Two male siblings presented in infancy with hyponatremia. We present a case study of two male siblings who presented in infancy with hyponatremia. Both siblings were found to have hearing loss and familial salivary gland insensitivity to aldosterone. Genetic testing revealed a novel mutation in the mineralocorticoid receptor gene. Despite treatment with high-dose sodium chloride and fludrocortisone, electrolyte abnormalities persisted in both siblings, indicating resistance to aldosterone. Audiological evaluation confirmed bilateral sensorineural hearing loss in both subjects. Further investigation is required to understand the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of this novel syndrome. Currently, there is no specific treatment available for the hearing loss associated with this syndrome. This case highlights the need for further research to improve our understanding and management of this rare condition.",1

"Drug response of head and neck tumors in native-state histoculture.  We describe a chemosensitivity testing of head and neck tumors, in which a native-state histoculture, ie, a three-dimensional culture system that maintains important in vivo properties, including tissue architecture, was used. Chemosensitivity testing of head and neck tumors is crucial for guiding personalized treatment strategies. In this study, we utilized a native-state histoculture system, which preserves the in vivo properties of the tissue, including tissue architecture. Tumor samples from head and neck cancer patients were cultured in this three-dimensional system, and their response to various chemotherapeutic agents was assessed. Our findings demonstrate that the native-state histoculture system accurately reflects drug response in tumors, as compared to conventional two-dimensional cell cultures. This approach provides a valuable tool for predicting individualized drug responses and advancing precision medicine in the treatment of head and neck tumors.",1
"Blood pressure measurements during dental checkups representative of 26-hour registration.  The effect of dental checkups on blood pressure was investigated. This study aimed to investigate the effect of dental checkups on blood pressure measurements over a 26-hour period. Blood pressure measurements were taken from 50 participants before, during, and after dental checkups. The results showed a significant increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure during the dental checkups compared to baseline measurements. This increase was sustained for up to 2 hours post-checkup and gradually returned to baseline levels over the following 24 hours. Interestingly, participants who reported dental anxiety exhibited a greater increase in blood pressure during the checkups compared to those without anxiety. These findings suggest that dental checkups can temporarily elevate blood pressure, particularly in individuals with dental anxiety. Further research is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms and potential long-term effects of these blood pressure fluctuations in dental settings.",1
"Central airway obstruction due to cytomegalovirus-induced necrotizing tracheitis in a patient with AIDS. This case report describes a patient with AIDS who presented with central airway obstruction caused by cytomegalovirus-induced necrotizing tracheitis. The patient had a history of recurrent respiratory symptoms and was found to have marked tracheal stenosis on bronchoscopy. Histological examination of the tracheal tissue revealed focal ulceration, granulation tissue, and dense infiltration of inflammatory cells, consistent with cytomegalovirus infection. The patient underwent bronchoscopic debridement and received antiviral therapy with ganciclovir. Despite initial improvement, the patient experienced recurrent episodes of airway obstruction requiring multiple interventions, including bronchoscopic stent placement and dilation. The patient ultimately developed respiratory failure and succumbed to the disease. This case highlights the importance of considering cytomegalovirus-induced tracheitis as a potential cause of central airway obstruction in patients with AIDS and emphasizes the challenges in managing this rare complication.

"Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease from allogeneic dura: a review of risks and safety. Allogeneic dura mater grafts are frequently used in neurosurgical procedures, but there is potential for the transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a fatal neurodegenerative disorder. This review examines the risks and safety associated with allogeneic dura grafts. Multiple cases of CJD transmission from contaminated dura grafts have been reported, resulting in a high mortality rate. The risk of CJD transmission is influenced by factors such as the donor's age, genotype, and the presence of underlying dural pathologies. Current screening and sterilization techniques may not completely eliminate the risk of CJD transmission. Various safety measures have been proposed, including stricter donor selection criteria and the use of alternative graft materials. Surgeons and neurologists should be aware of the potential risks and consider alternative options to minimize the risk of CJD transmission associated with allogeneic dura grafts.",1
"Nitrite from inflammatory cells--a cancer risk factor in ulcerative colitis? Elevated levels of luminal nitrite and a lowered luminal pH were found in 77 percent of patients with acute ulcerative colitis. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. Ulcerative colitis is a form of IBD characterized by inflammation of the colon and rectum. Previous studies have suggested that nitrite, a molecule produced by inflammatory cells, may play a role in the development of cancer. In this study, elevated levels of luminal nitrite and a decreased luminal pH were observed in the majority of patients with acute ulcerative colitis. These findings suggest that nitrite from inflammatory cells may act as a risk factor for cancer development in ulcerative colitis patients. Further research is needed to elucidate the exact mechanisms underlying this association and to develop potential preventive strategies.",1

"Differences in the membrane interaction of scrapie amyloid precursor proteins in normal and scrapie- or Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease-infected brains. This study aimed to investigate the differences in membrane interaction of scrapie amyloid precursor proteins (PrPSc) in normal brains and brains infected with scrapie or Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Membrane fractions were isolated from normal, scrapie-infected, and CJD-infected brains and subjected to Western blot analysis using antibodies against the C-terminus of PrP. The results showed that PrPSc from scrapie-infected and CJD-infected brains exhibited an increased interaction with membranes compared to PrP from normal brains. Additionally, the membrane-bound PrPSc displayed a higher molecular weight compared to the soluble form. Furthermore, the membrane-bound PrPSc from CJD-infected brains exhibited a distinct electrophoretic pattern compared to scrapie-infected brains. These findings suggest that the membrane interaction of PrPSc is altered in brains infected with scrapie or CJD, possibly contributing to the disease pathogenesis. Further investigation is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and implications of these differences in membrane interaction.",1
"Role of cell-mediated immunity to staphylococci in blepharitis. This study aimed to investigate the role of cell-mediated immunity in blepharitis caused by staphylococci. A total of 40 patients with chronic blepharitis were enrolled, and their clinical parameters were assessed. T-cell proliferation assays were performed to measure the cell-mediated immune response against staphylococcal antigens. The results showed that patients with blepharitis had significantly reduced T-cell proliferation compared to healthy controls, indicating impaired cell-mediated immunity. Furthermore, the severity of blepharitis was negatively correlated with T-cell proliferation, suggesting that a compromised immune response may contribute to the progression of the disease. These findings highlight the importance of cell-mediated immunity in the pathogenesis of blepharitis and suggest potential avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting immune function in this condition.",1
"Effects of acute ethanol ingestion and burn injury on serum immunoglobulin.  Previous studies have found that acute ethanol ingestion before burn injury caused further impairment of mitogenic response of B lymphocytes compared with burn injury alone. The effects of acute ethanol ingestion and burn injury on serum immunoglobulin levels were examined in this study. Previous research has demonstrated that acute ethanol ingestion exacerbates the weakening of the mitogenic response of B lymphocytes caused by burn injury. To further investigate this phenomenon, a total of 40 adult male rats were divided into four groups: control, ethanol, burn injury, and ethanol plus burn injury. The rats in the ethanol group were given a single dose of ethanol via oral gavage, while the burn injury group received a full-thickness burn injury. The ethanol plus burn injury group experienced both acute ethanol ingestion and burn injury. After 24 hours, blood samples were collected for analysis of serum immunoglobulin levels. The results showed that acute ethanol ingestion alone did not significantly affect serum immunoglobulin levels. However, burn injury alone caused a significant decrease in serum immunoglobulin levels compared to the control group. Interestingly, acute ethanol ingestion combined with burn injury resulted in an even further reduction in serum immunoglobulin levels, indicating a synergistic effect between acute ethanol ingestion and burn injury on immune function. These findings suggest that acute ethanol ingestion can exacerbate the immunosuppressive effects of burn injury, highlighting the importance of avoiding alcohol consumption during the recovery phase of burn injury.",1

This case series evaluates the use of cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive in closing leaking filtering blebs. Four patients with leaking blebs were treated with cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive. Follow-up examinations showed successful closure of the leaking blebs and resolution of symptoms in all patients. No adverse effects were observed. Cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive appears to be a safe and effective alternative for managing leaking filtering blebs. Further studies are warranted to validate these findings and explore long-term outcomes.",1
"Proximal posterior cerebral artery occlusion simulating middle cerebral artery occlusion. Proximal posterior cerebral artery (PCA) occlusion is a rare condition that can mimic middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. We present two cases of patients who presented with clinical and radiological findings consistent with MCA occlusion, but subsequent angiogram revealed proximal PCA occlusion. This misdiagnosis can lead to delayed or inappropriate treatment, as the management of MCA and PCA occlusions differs. Recognition of the radiological and clinical features that distinguish these two conditions is essential. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of proximal PCA occlusion when evaluating patients with suspected MCA occlusion to ensure accurate diagnosis and appropriate management. Further studies are needed to explore the underlying mechanisms and risk factors associated with proximal PCA occlusion.",1
"Spinal cord inhibitory mechanisms in Parkinson's disease. This study aimed to investigate the involvement of spinal cord inhibitory mechanisms in Parkinson's disease. Using animal models, researchers examined the changes in spinal cord inhibitory neurotransmission and its relation to motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. They found that there was a reduction in the inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), in the spinal cord of Parkinson's disease animals. This decrease in GABAergic transmission was associated with an increase in motor symptoms and motor cortex hyperexcitability. Additionally, the researchers observed alterations in the expression of GABA receptor subtypes, suggesting a dysregulation of inhibitory signaling in Parkinson's disease. These findings highlight the role of spinal cord inhibitory mechanisms in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease and suggest potential therapeutic targets for managing motor symptoms. Further research is needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms and develop targeted interventions.",1
"Effects of pill-giving on maintenance of placebo response in patients with chronic mild depression Fifty outpatients with mild, chronic, mood-reactive depression whose mood improved markedly after a 10-day single-blind placebo trial were randomly assigned in a double-blind design either to have their placebo medication discontinued or to have it maintained for an additional 6 weeks. This study aimed to investigate the effects of discontinuing placebo medication on the maintenance of placebo response in patients with chronic mild depression. Fifty outpatients who showed marked improvement in mood after a 10-day single-blind placebo trial were randomly assigned to either discontinue placebo medication or continue it for 6 more weeks in a double-blind design. The results suggest that maintaining placebo medication led to better maintenance of the placebo response in patients with chronic mild depression.

"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the patient with cancer.  The records of 114 cancer patients suffering cardiopulmonary arrests (CPA) during a 3-year period at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) were retrospectively reviewed to identify variables predicting final outcome in these patients. This retrospective review aimed to identify predictive factors for final outcomes in cancer patients who suffered cardiopulmonary arrests (CPA). The medical records of 114 patients at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center were analyzed over a 3-year period. Among the study population, the majority (62%) had solid tumors. The overall survival rate was found to be 4.4% with a median survival time of 1.4 months. Patients who had a return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) were more likely to survive than those who did not (p < 0.01). Additionally, patients with a ROSC and a non-solid tumor had a higher survival rate than those with a ROSC and a solid tumor (p < 0.001). These findings provide insight into predicting outcomes and guiding resuscitation efforts in cancer patients who suffer CPA.",1
"Ultrasonography in the differentiation of complicated and uncomplicated acute pyelonephritis.  Differentiation of uncomplicated pyelonephritis versus complicated pyelonephritis has always been problematic. Differentiating between complicated and uncomplicated acute pyelonephritis has always posed a challenge. This article examines the role of ultrasonography in distinguishing these two conditions. Several studies were reviewed, and it was found that ultrasonography can be a valuable tool in identifying complications associated with acute pyelonephritis. Findings such as the presence of abscesses, focal renal enlargement, or focal loss of cortical definition on ultrasound were indicative of complicated pyelonephritis. On the other hand, uncomplicated pyelonephritis usually presented with diffuse renal enlargement and increased echogenicity. Despite its usefulness, ultrasonography alone might not be sufficient for an accurate diagnosis, and additional imaging techniques like computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging might be required in certain cases. Overall, ultrasonography shows promise in differentiating complicated and uncomplicated acute pyelonephritis, but further research is needed to fully establish its diagnostic accuracy.",1

"Dissociation between pain and autonomic disturbances in cluster headache. Cluster headache is a severe headache disorder characterized by excruciatingly painful episodes that occur in clusters or bouts. This study aimed to investigate the dissociation between pain and autonomic disturbances in cluster headache. A total of 29 patients were included in the study, and their pain intensity and autonomic disturbances were assessed during cluster headache attacks. Surprisingly, 13 out of the 29 patients reported dissociation between pain and autonomic disturbances, where they experienced severe pain without accompanying autonomic symptoms. These patients had shorter attack durations, lower frequency of attacks, and a longer history of cluster headache compared to those without dissociation. Furthermore, they had a higher prevalence of chronic cluster headache. These findings highlight the complex nature of cluster headache and suggest that autonomic disturbances may not be essential for diagnosing and managing the condition. Future research should focus on elucidating the mechanisms underlying dissociation between pain and autonomic disturbances to improve the understanding and treatment of cluster headache.",1
"Reduction of the membrane fluidity of human breast cancer cells by tamoxifen and 17 beta-estradiol.

"Triiodothyronine and brain excitability.  We investigated mechanisms involved in thyroid hormone action on brain excitability. This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms involved in the effect of triiodothyronine (T3) hormone on brain excitability. Through electrophysiological experiments using rat hippocampal slices, we found that T3 treatment led to increased neuronal excitability, manifested by a reduction in current thresholds for action potential generation. This effect was mediated by enhancement of glutamatergic synaptic transmission, as evidenced by an increase in the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous excitatory synaptic currents. Moreover, T3 treatment resulted in upregulation of glutamate receptors, particularly N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. These findings suggest that T3 hormone modulates brain excitability through its effects on glutamatergic neurotransmission. Importantly, our results shed light on the potential involvement of thyroid hormone dysregulation in the pathophysiology of neurological disorders characterized by altered brain excitability, highlighting new avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting the thyroid hormone system.",1

"Absence of acetylcholine-induced current in epithelial cells from thymus glands and thymomas of myasthenia gravis patients. Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue. The thymus gland has been implicated in the pathogenesis of MG, specifically in the production of autoantibodies against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) on muscle cells. This study aimed to investigate the presence of acetylcholine-induced current in epithelial cells from thymus glands and thymomas of MG patients. Epithelial cells were isolated from thymus specimens of MG patients who underwent thymectomy or thymothymectomy and were compared to controls without MG. Patch-clamp recordings were performed to assess the acetylcholine-induced current. The results showed an absence of acetylcholine-induced current in epithelial cells from both thymus glands and thymomas of MG patients, indicating a functional impairment in AChR signaling. These findings suggest that the absence of acetylcholine-induced current in thymic epithelial cells may contribute to the development and perpetuation of MG by disrupting immune regulation and potentially leading to the production of autoantibodies against AChR. Further studies are warranted to explore the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets related to this phenomenon in MG.",1
"The technicon H6000 analyzer discriminates chronic lymphocytic leukemia from other B-cell leukemias through automatic assessment of large unstained cells. The ability to accurately distinguish chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) from other B-cell leukemias is crucial for proper diagnosis and treatment. We evaluated the performance of the technicon H6000 analyzer in discriminating CLL from other B-cell leukemias by automatically assessing large unstained cells (LUCs). A total of 75 patients with confirmed B-cell leukemia were included in the study. The technicon H6000 analyzer accurately identified CLL in 65 out of 75 patients, resulting in a sensitivity of 86.7%. The specificity was 100%, as no false positives were observed. The automated assessment of LUCs by the technicon H6000 analyzer showed promise in differentiating CLL from other B-cell leukemias, providing a rapid and reliable diagnostic tool for clinicians. Further studies are warranted to validate these findings and assess the performance in larger patient cohorts.",1
"Attachment of bacteria to tonsillar epithelium during acute tonsillitis. Acute tonsillitis is a common upper respiratory infection that often results in the attachment of bacteria to the tonsillar epithelium. This process is believed to be a crucial step in the pathogenesis of the disease. However, the mechanisms by which bacterial adhesion occurs during acute tonsillitis are not well understood. In this study, we investigated the attachment of bacteria to the tonsillar epithelium in patients with acute tonsillitis. Our results showed that several bacterial species, including Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae, were able to attach to the tonsillar epithelium. Furthermore, we found that the attachment of bacteria was mediated by specific adhesion molecules present on the surface of the epithelial cells. These findings provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of acute tonsillitis and may have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat this common infection.",1

After withdrawal, colorectal transit time significantly increased from 24. This study aimed to investigate the recovery of colonic transit time after alcohol withdrawal in chronic alcoholic subjects. Twenty individuals who were dependent on alcohol participated in the study. Total and segmental transit time of the colorectal region were assessed before and after alcohol withdrawal. The results showed a significant increase in colorectal transit time following alcohol withdrawal, compared to the initial measurement of 24. Further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms and potential interventions for restoring normal colonic transit time in individuals recovering from alcohol addiction.",1
"Role of tolerance in cloxacillin treatment of experimental Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis. Cloxacillin is a commonly used treatment for Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis; however, its efficacy may be hindered by the development of tolerance. This study aimed to investigate the role of tolerance in cloxacillin treatment. Experimental endocarditis was induced in rabbits, and they were then treated with cloxacillin for 10 days. Tolerance was assessed by comparing the efficacy of cloxacillin against infective endocarditis caused by low-level oxacillin-resistant strains of S. aureus versus susceptible strains. Results showed that rabbits infected with susceptible strains had a significantly lower mortality rate compared to those infected with resistant strains. Additionally, bacterial counts in vegetations were significantly lower in animals infected with susceptible strains. These findings indicate that tolerance to cloxacillin occurs in S. aureus endocarditis and may have significant clinical implications. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms underlying this tolerance.",1
"Management of local and regional recurrence after mastectomy or breast-conserving treatment. Management of local and regional recurrence after mastectomy or breast-conserving treatment is a critical aspect of breast cancer care. Local recurrence, defined as the reappearance of cancer in the breast or chest wall after initial treatment, can occur in up to 30% of patients. Regional recurrence, involving the lymph nodes in the axilla or supraclavicular region, further complicates the management strategy. Treatment options vary based on factors such as tumor characteristics, previous treatment modalities, and patient preference. Surgical intervention, including re-excision or lymph node dissection, is often required in combination with adjuvant therapies such as radiation therapy or systemic chemotherapy. Close monitoring and regular follow-up are crucial for early detection and prompt intervention. Multidisciplinary collaboration between surgeons, oncologists, radiation therapists, and pathologists is essential to tailor individualized treatment plans and optimize patient outcomes.",1
"Doppler color-flow images from a stenosed arterial model: interpretation of flow patterns. Doppler color-flow imaging is a noninvasive technique used to assess blood flow patterns in stenosed arteries. In this study, we present and interpret the flow patterns observed in a simulated stenosed arterial model using this technique. The model consisted of a tube with a partial occlusion, mimicking stenosis in the arterial lumen. Doppler color-flow images were acquired at various locations upstream and downstream of the stenosis. Analysis of the images revealed distinct flow patterns, including turbulent flow, jet flow, and recirculation zones. These patterns were dependent on the degree of stenosis and the velocity of blood flow. Understanding these flow patterns is crucial for the accurate diagnosis and management of arterial stenosis. Doppler color-flow imaging provides valuable insights into the hemodynamic changes associated with stenosis, aiding in the assessment of disease severity and guiding treatment decisions. Further research and refinement of this imaging technique are warranted to improve its clinical utility in the diagnosis of arterial stenosis.",1
"Primary solid neoplasms of the greater omentum.  Primary solid tumors of the greater omentum are rare, with only 42 reported cases. This study reports on 42 cases of primary solid tumors located in the greater omentum, a rare occurrence. The majority of these tumors were found incidentally during surgery for unrelated conditions. The most common presenting symptom was abdominal pain, followed by a palpable abdominal mass. The mean age at diagnosis was 58 years, and the female to male ratio was 2:1. Histologically, the tumors were classified as sarcomas in 45% of cases, carcinomas in 24%, and stromal tumors in 12%. The remaining cases were categorized as lymphomas, melanomas, or germ cell tumors. Surgical resection was the primary treatment modality, often combined with adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy. The overall prognosis was poor, with a high incidence of local recurrence and distant metastasis. Further research is needed to better understand the pathogenesis and optimal management of these rare tumors.",1
"Prediction of cognitive change as a function of preoperative ability status among temporal lobectomy patients seen at 6-month follow-up. The present study aimed to predict cognitive change in temporal lobectomy patients based on their preoperative ability status. Participants who underwent the surgery were assessed at a 6-month follow-up to determine any changes in cognitive functioning. Preoperative ability status was assessed using standardized neuropsychological tests. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to determine whether preoperative ability status could predict cognitive change at the 6-month follow-up. Results showed that preoperative ability status significantly predicted cognitive change, with higher preoperative ability associated with greater cognitive improvement (尾 = 0.35, p < 0.05). It was observed that patients with higher preoperative ability had better cognitive performance at the follow-up assessment. These findings suggest that preoperative cognitive abilities can serve as a valuable predictor of cognitive outcomes in temporal lobectomy patients. Further research is needed to explore other factors that may influence cognitive change post-surgery.",1
"Long-time survival of a patient with glioblastoma and Turcot's syndrome. We present a case of a 43-year-old male diagnosed with glioblastoma and Turcot's syndrome, a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the presence of multiple colorectal adenomas. Despite the poor prognosis associated with glioblastoma, this patient survived for an unusually long period of 9 years following diagnosis. The survival can be attributed to the patient's young age at diagnosis, aggressive surgical resection, and subsequent adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Furthermore, the presence of Turcot's syndrome may have influenced the tumor's response to treatment, as certain genetic mutations associated with the syndrome have been shown to enhance sensitivity to chemotherapy. This exceptional case highlights the importance of individualized treatment approaches and further research into the underlying mechanisms of resistance and response in patients with glioblastoma and genetic syndromes.",1
"Changes in surgical treatments: the example of hysterectomy versus conization for cervical carcinoma in situ.  From 1969 through 1985, 4584 women in the state of New Mexico were diagnosed with carcinoma in situ of the cervix. From 1969 to 1985, a total of 4584 women in New Mexico were diagnosed with cervical carcinoma in situ. This study examines changes in surgical treatments for this condition over that time period. Specifically, the study compares the use of hysterectomy versus conization. Hysterectomy involves the removal of the uterus, while conization involves removing a cone-shaped piece of tissue from the cervix. The study found a significant shift in surgical approach, with hysterectomy becoming the preferred treatment option by the end of the study period. This trend could be attributed to advances in surgical techniques and increasing awareness of the potential for progression to invasive cervical cancer in women with carcinoma in situ.",1

Prompt management of desaturation events, including supplemental oxygen administration, was effective in resolving symptoms and preventing adverse outcomes. These findings highlight the importance of close monitoring and adequate oxygenation during gastrointestinal endoscopy to ensure patient safety. Further research is required to identify additional risk factors and optimize preventive strategies for minimizing arterial oxygen desaturation in this setting.",1
"The development of infratentorial atrophy in patients with idiopathic cerebellar ataxia of late onset: a CT study. This study aimed to investigate the development of infratentorial atrophy in patients with idiopathic cerebellar ataxia of late onset (ILOCA) using CT imaging. CT scans of the brain were obtained from 30 patients with ILOCA and 30 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. The degree of infratentorial atrophy was quantitatively assessed using a validated rating scale. The results showed a significant increase in infratentorial atrophy scores in patients with ILOCA compared to controls (mean score 2.7 vs. 0.6, p < 0.001). Furthermore, the severity of atrophy correlated with the duration and progression of ataxia symptoms in the patient group (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that infratentorial atrophy is a common feature in patients with ILOCA and may be related to disease progression. CT imaging could be a valuable tool for monitoring disease progression and assessing treatment efficacy in this patient population.",1
"Imaging the gallbladder: a historical perspective.  After Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen's discovery of the X-ray in 1895, it was initially thought that gallstones could not be visualized. This historical perspective review examines the imaging of the gallbladder following Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen's discovery of the X-ray in 1895. Initially, it was believed that gallstones could not be visualized using this new technology. However, subsequent advancements in radiography, including the introduction of contrast agents and cholecystography, allowed for the visualization of gallstones and the identification of gallbladder pathology. Advancements in ultrasound technology further improved the imaging of the gallbladder, allowing for non-invasive and real-time visualization. The development of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) has further enhanced the ability to diagnose and stage gallbladder carcinoma. This historical perspective highlights the progression of imaging techniques for the gallbladder and their impact on diagnosis and treatment.",1
"Nosocomial infections due to Xanthomonas maltophilia (Pseudomonas maltophilia) in patients with cancer.  From December 1985 to May 1986, Xanthomonas maltophilia (formerly known as Pseudomonas maltophilia) was isolated at an increased rate at our institution; 52 isolates of X. Nosocomial infections due to Xanthomonas maltophilia, also known as Pseudomonas maltophilia, pose a significant concern in cancer patients. This study investigates the occurrence of X. maltophilia infections in cancer patients at our institution from December 1985 to May 1986. A total of 52 isolates of X. maltophilia were identified during this period, representing an increased rate of isolation. These infections were likely acquired within the healthcare setting, as X. maltophilia is known to be a common hospital-acquired pathogen. Cancer patients are particularly vulnerable to these infections due to their compromised immune systems. Therefore, strict infection control measures should be implemented to prevent and manage nosocomial infections caused by X. maltophilia in cancer patients. Further research is warranted to explore effective treatment strategies for these infections.",1
"Hypertension during pregnancy in insulin-dependent diabetic women. Pregnant women with insulin-dependent diabetes are at higher risk for hypertension during pregnancy. In a retrospective study of 256 diabetic women, the incidence of hypertension was examined. The study showed that 38% of women developed hypertension during pregnancy, with the majority experiencing gestational hypertension rather than chronic hypertension. Additionally, women who had preexisting hypertension were more likely to have poor glucose control during pregnancy. Furthermore, women with preexisting hypertension had a higher incidence of preterm delivery and intrauterine growth restriction compared to those without hypertension. These findings indicate that hypertension is a common complication in insulin-dependent diabetic women during pregnancy and is associated with poor glucose control and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, close monitoring and management of blood pressure and glucose control are essential in this population to optimize maternal and fetal outcomes.",1
"Optimal escort for interhospital transport of pediatric emergencies. Interhospital transport of pediatric emergencies requires optimal escort to ensure patient safety and to provide appropriate medical care during the transfer. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of different escort models on the outcomes of interhospital transport in pediatric emergencies. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 250 pediatric patients who were transferred between hospitals for emergency care. Four escort models were compared: physician-led, nurse-led, paramedic-led, and non-medical personnel-led. The primary outcomes measured were transport time, adverse events during transport, and patient outcomes. The results showed that the physician-led escort model had the shortest transport time and the lowest rate of adverse events during transport. Furthermore, patients escorted by physicians had significantly better outcomes compared to other escort models. These findings suggest that a physician-led escort model is the optimal approach for interhospital transport of pediatric emergencies, as it can ensure timely and safe transfer while providing appropriate medical care.

"Relative effects of brain and non-brain injuries on neuropsychological and psychosocial outcome. This study aimed to investigate the relative effects of brain and non-brain injuries on neuropsychological and psychosocial outcomes in individuals with traumatic injuries. A total of 100 participants were included in the study, with 50 having brain injuries and 50 having non-brain injuries. Neuropsychological and psychosocial assessments were conducted at multiple time points up to five years post-injury. Results showed that individuals with brain injuries exhibited significantly lower cognitive functioning and poorer psychosocial outcomes compared to those with non-brain injuries. Additionally, the severity of brain injury was found to be directly related to the extent of impairment in both neuropsychological and psychosocial domains. These findings suggest that brain injuries have a more detrimental impact on cognitive functioning and psychosocial well-being compared to non-brain injuries. Early and targeted interventions should be implemented to optimize outcomes in individuals with brain injuries.",1
"Intraoperative ultrasonography and the detection of liver metastases in patients with colorectal cancer. This study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUS) in detecting liver metastases in patients with colorectal cancer.

Lateral deviation of the eyes on forced lid closure in patients with cerebral lesions. Forced lid closure and subsequent lateral deviation of the eyes has been observed in patients with cerebral lesions. This phenomenon has not been well documented or understood. We conducted a study to investigate this clinical sign and its association with cerebral lesions. We analyzed the medical records of 100 patients with cerebral lesions who exhibited forced lid closure during physical examination. We found that 78% of these patients also showed lateral deviation of the eyes towards the side of the cerebral lesion. This abnormal eye movement was more frequently observed in patients with lesions involving the frontal and parietal lobes. Our findings suggest that lateral deviation of the eyes on forced lid closure may serve as a potential diagnostic and prognostic indicator for cerebral lesions. Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and clinical implications of this phenomenon.,1
"Small bile duct abnormalities in sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease that can affect multiple organs, including the liver. In this study, the authors examined the presence of small bile duct abnormalities in patients with sarcoidosis. Liver biopsies were performed on 62 patients with sarcoidosis, and bile duct abnormalities were observed in 10 patients (16.1%). These abnormalities included bile duct wall thickening, periductal fibrosis, and bile ductular proliferation. Interestingly, none of the patients had clinical symptoms or laboratory evidence of liver dysfunction. The authors conclude that small bile duct abnormalities are a common finding in sarcoidosis, even in the absence of liver dysfunction, suggesting that these abnormalities may be a manifestation of the systemic inflammatory process. Further studies are needed to better understand the clinical significance of these findings.",1

The children were evaluated for psychiatric diagnoses using standardized assessments. The results showed that 50.5% of children had at least one psychiatric diagnosis, with the most common being attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and major depressive disorder. Children of women with bipolar affective disorder had a higher risk of developing bipolar disorder themselves compared to those born to women with unipolar disorder. The findings suggest the importance of early identification and intervention for children at risk.",1
"Contracturing granulomatous myositis: a separate entity. Contracturing granulomatous myositis (CGM) is a rare inflammatory myopathy characterized by gradually progressive muscle weakness and contractures. We present a case series of five patients with CGM and provide a comprehensive analysis of their clinical, histopathological, and radiological features. All patients had symmetric proximal muscle weakness, joint contractures, and elevated muscle enzymes. Biopsies revealed granulomatous inflammation, fibrosis, and muscle fiber necrosis. Magnetic resonance imaging showed muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration. CGM was found to be distinct from other forms of inflammatory myopathies based on its unique clinical presentation and histopathological features. Treatment with immunosuppressants and physical therapy resulted in variable improvement in muscle strength and contractures. This case series highlights the importance of recognizing CGM as a separate entity in the spectrum of inflammatory myopathies, which can aid in timely diagnosis and appropriate management. Further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying pathogenesis and identify more effective treatment strategies for CGM.",1
"Malignant glandular triton tumor. Malignant glandular triton tumor (MGTT) is a rare and aggressive subtype of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) that exhibits divergent differentiation, including rhabdomyoblastic elements. This study presents a case report of a 52-year-old male patient who presented with a large retroperitoneal mass. Histological examination revealed a high-grade sarcomatous neoplasm with glandular and rhabdomyoblastic differentiation. Immunohistochemical studies confirmed positive staining for epithelial and muscle markers, supporting the diagnosis of MGTT. Further molecular analysis identified loss of heterozygosity in multiple loci, consistent with the tumor's malignant behavior. The patient underwent surgical resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Despite aggressive treatment, the patient experienced local recurrence and distant metastasis, ultimately succumbing to the disease. MGTT is a rare and challenging tumor with a poor prognosis, emphasizing the need for further understanding of its pathogenesis and development of effective treatment strategies.",1
"Clinicopathologic and flow cytometric DNA study of medullary thyroid carcinoma.  Sixty-one patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma were investigated to establish relationships between the neoplasm's DNA content, other clinicopathologic factors, and patient survival (at least 5 years' follow-up). We conducted a clinicopathologic and flow cytometric DNA study on 61 patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma. Our aim was to determine the relationship between DNA content, clinicopathologic factors, and patient survival. Patients were followed up for at least 5 years. We found that DNA content did not correlate with age, sex, tumor size, or lymph node metastasis. However, a significant association was observed between DNA content and patient survival. Patients with higher DNA content had poorer survival outcomes compared to those with lower DNA content. These findings suggest that DNA content may serve as a prognostic marker for medullary thyroid carcinoma.",1

"Noninvasive assessment of cardiac output in children using impedance cardiography.  This study evaluated the effect of intracardiac shunting on the accuracy of thoracic bioimpedance-derived cardiac output determinations. Intracardiac shunting can affect the accuracy of noninvasive cardiac output measurements obtained through thoracic bioimpedance. We conducted a study to evaluate this effect in children. Cardiac output was measured using thoracic bioimpedance in 54 children with varying degrees of intracardiac shunting, including 26 patients with right-to-left shunt and 28 patients with left-to-right shunt. The measurements were compared to cardiac output values obtained using a reference method. Our results showed that the presence of right-to-left shunting significantly underestimated cardiac output, while left-to-right shunting did not have a significant effect. The underestimation was more pronounced in patients with larger shunt fractions and in those with lower systemic vascular resistance. In conclusion, intracardiac shunting affects the accuracy of thoracic bioimpedance-derived cardiac output measurements in children. Clinicians should consider these factors when interpreting noninvasive cardiac output data in this population.",1
"Spinal cord compression from a thoracic paraganglioma: case report. Spinal cord compression resulting from a thoracic paraganglioma is a rare occurrence. We report a case of a 45-year-old male who presented with progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary incontinence.

"Comparison of shunt fraction estimation using transcolonic iodine-123-iodoamphetamine and technetium-99m-pertechnetate in a group of dogs with experimentally-induced chronic biliary cirrhosis. Chronic biliary cirrhosis is a progressive liver disease characterized by impaired hepatic circulation. Shunt fraction estimation, a method to quantify the blood flow bypassing the liver, is crucial for assessing disease severity and guiding treatment decisions. In this study, we compared the accuracy of transcolonic iodine-123-iodoamphetamine (IMP) and technetium-99m-pertechnetate (Tc-99m) for shunt fraction estimation in dogs with experimentally-induced chronic biliary cirrhosis. Dogs were divided into two groups: control and cirrhotic. Both IMP and Tc-99m were administered intravenously, followed by scintigraphy to visualize the shunt fraction. We found a significant correlation between the shunt fraction measured by IMP and Tc-99m in both control and cirrhotic groups. However, the shunt fraction estimates were higher with IMP compared to Tc-99m in the cirrhotic group.

"Marijuana smoking as a possible cause of tongue carcinoma in young patients. This study aimed to determine if marijuana smoking is a possible cause of tongue carcinoma in young patients. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 40 patients diagnosed with tongue carcinoma under the age of 40, and 40 age-matched controls without tongue carcinoma. The use of marijuana was self-reported by the patients. Results showed that 65% of the tongue carcinoma patients were marijuana smokers, compared to only 10% in the control group. The odds ratio for developing tongue carcinoma in marijuana smokers was found to be 12.5. Furthermore, the duration and intensity of marijuana smoking were positively correlated with the risk of developing tongue carcinoma. These findings suggest that marijuana smoking may be a significant risk factor for tongue carcinoma in young patients and emphasize the need for further studies to confirm these findings.",1
"Use of activated charcoal to reduce elevated serum phenobarbital concentration in a neonate.  The course of a neonate administered activated charcoal orally for elevated phenobarbital concentration is described. This case report describes the successful reduction of elevated serum phenobarbital concentration in a neonate through the administration of activated charcoal orally. The neonate presented with a dangerously high phenobarbital concentration due to a medication error. Activated charcoal was chosen as a treatment option to enhance drug elimination by adsorption in the gastrointestinal tract. After obtaining parental consent, the neonate received a single dose of activated charcoal. Serial blood samples were collected to monitor the serum phenobarbital levels. Within hours of the activated charcoal administration, a significant decrease in the serum phenobarbital concentration was observed. The neonate's clinical condition remained stable throughout the treatment. Activated charcoal appears to be a safe and effective treatment option for reducing elevated serum phenobarbital levels in neonates. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the optimal dosing and administration schedule of activated charcoal in this patient population.",1

"Prognosticating study for cervical myelopathy using evoked spinal cord potentials. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of evoked spinal cord potentials (ESCPs) in patients with cervical myelopathy. A total of 78 patients diagnosed with cervical myelopathy underwent preoperative ESCP testing. The ESCPs included somatosensory evoked potentials and motor evoked potentials. The patients were followed up for a median period of 36 months. The primary outcome measure was the improvement in neurological function based on the modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) score. The results showed that patients with positive ESCPs had a significantly higher rate of neurological improvement compared to those with negative ESCPs (p < 0.05). Additionally, the absence of ESCPs was associated with a higher risk of postoperative deterioration (p < 0.05). In conclusion, ESCPs can be a valuable prognostic tool for assessing the outcome of surgical intervention in patients with cervical myelopathy.",1
Mammographic follow-up of low-suspicion lesions: compliance rate and diagnostic yield. This study aims to assess the compliance rate and diagnostic yield of mammographic follow-up for low-suspicion lesions. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 500 patients who had undergone mammographic imaging for low-suspicion lesions. The compliance rate was determined by examining the number of patients who returned for scheduled follow-up appointments. The diagnostic yield was assessed by determining the number of patients who were subsequently diagnosed with breast cancer. The results showed a compliance rate of 75% and a diagnostic yield of 2.5%. These findings suggest that mammographic follow-up for low-suspicion lesions has a relatively low compliance rate and a low diagnostic yield. Further research is needed to identify strategies to improve patient compliance and increase the diagnostic yield in this population.,1
"An analysis of abnormalities of the retinoblastoma gene in human ovarian and endometrial carcinoma. This study aimed to investigate abnormalities of the retinoblastoma (RB) gene in ovarian and endometrial carcinoma. Tumor samples from 50 patients with ovarian carcinoma and 50 patients with endometrial carcinoma were analyzed. Abnormalities of the RB gene were detected using polymerase chain reaction and direct DNA sequencing. Results showed that 20% of patients with ovarian carcinoma and 18% of patients with endometrial carcinoma had RB gene abnormalities. Among these abnormalities, gene mutations were the most common, followed by loss of heterozygosity and promoter hypermethylation. Furthermore, RB gene abnormalities were associated with advanced tumor stage and lymph node involvement in both types of carcinoma. These findings suggest that abnormalities of the RB gene may contribute to the development and progression of ovarian and endometrial carcinoma. Targeting the RB pathway could be a potential therapeutic strategy for these cancers. Further investigation is warranted to elucidate the precise mechanisms and clinical implications of RB gene abnormalities in these types of carcinoma.",1

"Microscopic pulmonary tumor embolism causing subacute cor pulmonale: a difficult antemortem diagnosis [published erratum appears in Mayo Clin Proc 1991 Apr;66(4):439] Microscopic pulmonary tumor embolism is difficult to diagnose. Pulmonary tumor embolism is a rare but potentially fatal complication of malignancy. It occurs when tumor cells or tumor emboli migrate to the pulmonary vasculature and cause obstruction, leading to pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale. The diagnosis of this condition is challenging due to its nonspecific clinical presentation and lack of specific imaging findings. We present a case of a patient with subacute cor pulmonale who was ultimately diagnosed with microscopic pulmonary tumor embolism. The patient had a history of lung carcinoma, and autopsy confirmed the presence of tumor emboli in the pulmonary vasculature. This case highlights the importance of considering pulmonary tumor embolism in the differential diagnosis of unexplained cor pulmonale, particularly in patients with known malignancy. Early recognition and prompt treatment are crucial for improving patient outcomes. Further research is needed to improve the diagnostic accuracy and management strategies for this rare condition.",1

Further analysis using regression equations indicated that age was positively correlated with heart weight, with an estimated increase of 1.6 grams per year. Additionally, height and body weight were also found to be positively correlated with heart weight. No significant differences in heart weight were observed based on cause of death or presence of cardiovascular disease. These findings contribute to our understanding of heart weights in young adult white men and may have implications for clinical practice and research.",1
"Air in the fissure for the ligamentum teres: new sign of intraperitoneal air on plain radiographs. Intraperitoneal air on plain radiographs is typically recognized by the presence of pneumoperitoneum or specific signs such as Rigler's sign or the football sign. We report a novel sign of intraperitoneal air, the air in the fissure for the ligamentum teres, in two patients with acute abdominal pain. Both patients had prior abdominal surgery and developed symptoms consistent with bowel obstruction. On plain radiographs, air was visualized within the fissure for the ligamentum teres, a radiolucent area that represents a remnant of the fetal umbilical vein. This sign correlated with the presence of pneumoperitoneum confirmed on subsequent computed tomography scans. Awareness of this sign may aid in the early recognition and diagnosis of intraperitoneal air on plain radiographs.",1
"99mTc HM-PAO SPECT in pediatric migraine. Pediatric migraine is a common neurological disorder characterized by recurrent headaches. To investigate the cerebral blood flow changes during migraine attacks in children, we performed 99mTc hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime single-photon emission computed tomography (99mTc HM-PAO SPECT) in a group of pediatric patients. A total of 30 patients (mean age 10.1 years) with a history of migraine were included in this study. SPECT imaging was performed during a migraine attack and compared to the results obtained during headache-free intervals. The analysis revealed significant hypoperfusion in various cerebral regions, including the frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes, as well as the basal ganglia and cerebellum, during the migraine attack. These findings suggest that altered cerebral blood flow underlies the pathophysiology of pediatric migraine and may contribute to the development of headache symptoms. 99mTc HM-PAO SPECT can serve as a valuable tool for the diagnosis and monitoring of pediatric migraine. Further studies are warranted to explore the clinical implications of these findings and possible therapeutic targets.",1
"A T-cell neoplasia showing clinicopathologic features of malignant histiocytosis with novel chromosomal abnormalities and N-ras mutation.

Further studies are needed to validate these results and explore the potential of RB gene alterations as prognostic markers and therapeutic targets in sarcoma patients.",1
"Pineal hyperactivity in spontaneously hypertensive rats: muscarinic regulation of indole metabolism.  1. In this study, we investigated the role of muscarinic regulation in the pineal gland of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and its effect on indole metabolism. Pineal glands from SHR and control rats were analyzed for muscarinic receptor expression using immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. We found significantly higher levels of muscarinic receptor expression in the SHR pineal gland compared to controls. Indole metabolism was assessed by measuring the levels of pineal indoleamines using high-performance liquid chromatography. We observed increased levels of melatonin and serotonin in the SHR pineal gland, suggesting enhanced indole metabolism. Furthermore, muscarinic receptor blockade significantly reduced the levels of melatonin and serotonin in SHR pineal glands, indicating that muscarinic regulation plays a crucial role in indole metabolism. These findings suggest that pineal hyperactivity, mediated by muscarinic regulation, is involved in the pathophysiology of hypertension in SHR through modulation of indole metabolism.",1
"Anton's syndrome in a patient with posttraumatic optic neuropathy and bifrontal contusions. Anton's syndrome, characterized by denial of visual loss despite objective evidence, is a rare condition typically associated with bilateral occipital lobe lesions.

"Awareness during caesarean section.  Between 1982 and 1989 over 3000 patients were questioned about recall and dreaming after general anaesthesia for Caesarean section. Awareness during caesarean section, where patients have conscious awareness during surgery, is a concerning phenomenon. In a study conducted between 1982 and 1989, over 3000 patients who underwent general anesthesia for Caesarean section were interviewed about their experience of recall and dreaming. The results showed that 1 in 670 patients reported some level of awareness during the procedure, with 70% experiencing auditory and 40% experiencing visual awareness. However, only 8% of these patients had distressing experiences. Factors such as rapid sequence induction, lower doses of anesthesia, and higher levels of anxiety were associated with a higher incidence of awareness. The study highlights the importance of monitoring and optimizing anesthesia techniques to minimize the risk of awareness during Caesarean section.",1
"Pancreatic ascites: treatment by continuous somatostatin infusion. Pancreatic ascites is a rare complication of acute or chronic pancreatitis. We report four cases of pancreatic ascites that were successfully treated with continuous somatostatin infusion. All patients presented with abdominal distension, pain, and imaging exams confirmed the presence of ascites. Initial conservative management with fasting, bowel rest, and total parenteral nutrition was unsuccessful in resolving the condition in all cases. Continuous somatostatin infusion was initiated and maintained for a median duration of 10 days. In all cases, resolution of ascites occurred within 7 to 14 days of starting somatostatin infusion. No adverse events were observed during treatment. Continuous somatostatin infusion appears to be an effective and safe treatment option for pancreatic ascites. Further studies are warranted to determine the optimal dosage and duration of somatostatin therapy.",1

"Absence of acetylcholine-induced current in epithelial cells from thymus glands and thymomas of myasthenia gravis patients. Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue. The thymus gland has been implicated in the pathogenesis of MG, but the exact mechanisms underlying the disease remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the presence of acetylcholine-induced currents in epithelial cells from thymus glands and thymomas of MG patients. Patch-clamp recordings were performed on freshly isolated thymic epithelial cells. Our results showed a complete absence of acetylcholine-induced currents in both thymus glands and thymomas from MG patients, compared to controls. This suggests a functional impairment of the acetylcholine receptor in thymic epithelial cells of MG patients. Further analysis revealed a significant reduction in the expression of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits in MG thymus glands and thymomas. These findings provide new insights into the role of thymic epithelial cells in the pathogenesis of MG and suggest that dysfunction of the acetylcholine receptor in these cells may contribute to the development of autoimmunity in MG.",1
"Feasibility of reversing benzodiazepine tolerance with flumazenil To examine whether the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil can reverse tolerance to benzodiazepines but without precipitating withdrawal seizures, the antiepileptic effect of flumazenil itself and its ability to reverse tolerance at a dose that would leave sufficient receptors free for the binding of benzodiazepines were investigated. In this study, the potential of flumazenil to reverse benzodiazepine tolerance without causing withdrawal seizures was examined. The antiepileptic effect of flumazenil and its ability to reverse tolerance at a dose that would allow benzodiazepine binding were investigated.

"Genetic mechanisms of tumor suppression by the human p53 gene. The human p53 gene plays a crucial role in suppressing tumor formation and progression. This review examines the genetic mechanisms by which p53 acts as a tumor suppressor. Firstly, the p53 gene itself is subject to various mutations, leading to dysfunctional or absent p53 protein. These mutations can occur in the DNA binding domain or other regions of the gene, resulting in loss of p53-mediated tumor suppression. Additionally, p53 functions as a transcription factor, regulating the expression of numerous downstream genes involved in cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, apoptosis, and senescence. Mutations in these p53 target genes can also contribute to tumorigenesis. The review further discusses the various mechanisms by which p53 activity is regulated, including post-translational modifications, interaction with other proteins, and epigenetic modifications. Understanding the genetic mechanisms of p53 tumor suppression is critical for developing therapeutic strategies that can restore or enhance p53 function in cancer cells.",1

"Vaginosonographic measurement of endometrial thickness in the evaluation of amenorrhea.  The progestin-induced withdrawal bleeding test has often been used in patients with amenorrhea to assess endogenous estrogen (E) production. This study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of vaginosonographic measurement of endometrial thickness in assessing endogenous estrogen production in patients with amenorrhea. A total of 50 patients with amenorrhea underwent vaginosonographic measurement of endometrial thickness before and after the progestin-induced withdrawal bleeding test. The mean endometrial thickness before the test was 7.9 mm, with a range of 3-15 mm. After the test, 45 patients showed endometrial shedding, with a decrease in endometrial thickness to a mean of 4.2 mm. The other five patients did not show endometrial shedding and had a persistently thickened endometrium. Histological analysis confirmed the presence of endometrial hyperplasia in these cases. The sensitivity and specificity of vaginosonographic measurement of endometrial thickness in detecting endometrial shedding were 90% and 100%, respectively. These findings suggest that vaginosonographic measurement of endometrial thickness is a useful tool in evaluating amenorrhea and may help differentiate between normal endometrial shedding and endometrial hyperplasia. Further studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to confirm these findings.",1

"Spontaneous necrosis in osteosarcoma. Spontaneous necrosis refers to the process of tumor cell death within a neoplasm without any external intervention. Osteosarcoma, a malignant bone tumor, occasionally demonstrates spontaneous necrosis. This phenomenon is of clinical significance as it may influence treatment decisions and prognosis.

Spontaneous necrosis in osteosarcoma is believed to be a result of rapid tumor growth, inadequate blood supply, and subsequent ischemia. Necrosis can occur centrally within the tumor, leading to the formation of a necrotic core, or can extend throughout the entire lesion. This process often presents as a radiographic finding characterized by an irregular region of central lucency referred to as the ""soap-bubble"" appearance.

Spontaneous necrosis in osteosarcoma has been associated with improved prognosis and response to chemotherapy. The presence of necrosis is considered a positive prognostic factor, indicating better tumor response to treatment and increased likelihood of long-term survival. Therefore, accurate identification and evaluation of necrosis in osteosarcoma patients is crucial in determining the appropriate therapeutic approach and predicting outcomes.

In conclusion, spontaneous necrosis is an important phenomenon observed in osteosarcoma. Its presence is associated with improved prognosis and response to therapy. Proper recognition and analysis of necrosis can aid clinicians in making optimal treatment decisions for patients with osteosarcoma.",1

"The Ams (altered mRNA stability) protein and ribonuclease E are encoded by the same structural gene of Escherichia coli. The Ams protein and ribonuclease E (RNase E) play important roles in regulating mRNA stability in Escherichia coli. We investigated whether they are encoded by the same structural gene. Our results show that the Ams protein and RNase E are indeed products of the same gene. This conclusion was based on our analysis of deletion mutants and the study of transcriptional fusions. We found that the absence of the structural gene led to a lack of both Ams protein and RNase E expression. Furthermore, complementation studies confirmed that the re-introduction of the gene restored the production of both proteins. Our findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in mRNA stability regulation in E. coli and highlight the functional interplay between the Ams protein and RNase E. Further studies are required to elucidate the precise mechanisms underlying this interaction.",1

"Association of disease-free survival and percent of ideal dose in adjuvant breast chemotherapy. This study aimed to determine the association between disease-free survival (DFS) and the percent of the ideal dose received during adjuvant breast chemotherapy. Data from 300 breast cancer patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy were analyzed. The percent of the ideal dose received was calculated for each patient, with 100% representing the full prescribed dose. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards modeling were used to assess DFS. The median percent of the ideal dose received was 90%. Patients who received a higher percent of the ideal dose had significantly better DFS compared to those who received a lower percent (p<0.001). Cox regression analysis confirmed that a higher percent of the ideal dose was independently associated with improved DFS (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.60-0.87, p=0.001). These findings suggest that receiving a higher percent of the ideal dose during adjuvant breast chemotherapy may improve DFS and should be considered in treatment planning.",1
"Coronary collateral recruitment: functional significance and relation to rate of vessel closure.  Studies in animals and humans have demonstrated the anatomic presence and functional significance of coronary collaterals. Coronary collateral recruitment is a well-documented phenomenon in both animals and humans. This abstract reviews the existing studies that have demonstrated the presence and functional significance of coronary collaterals. These collaterals serve as alternative pathways for blood flow when there is a blockage in the main coronary artery. The rate of vessel closure, i.e., the speed at which the main artery becomes completely occluded, has been found to be inversely related to the extent of collateral recruitment. Studies have shown that a higher collateral recruitment can significantly delay the onset of myocardial ischemia and limit the size of the resulting infarction. Therefore, understanding the factors that influence collateral recruitment and finding ways to enhance it could potentially have important implications for the management and treatment of coronary artery disease.",1

"Kinin/prostaglandin system: its therapeutic value in surgical stress. The kinin/prostaglandin system plays a crucial role in the body's response to surgical stress. This abstract summarizes the therapeutic potential of modulating this system for managing surgical stress. Activation of the kinin/prostaglandin system leads to local inflammation, pain, vasodilation, and increased vascular permeability. These responses, although initially protective, can become excessive, leading to tissue damage and other adverse effects. Several pharmacological interventions have been developed to target this system and attenuate the inflammatory response during surgery. This includes the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, and bradykinin receptor antagonists. These interventions have shown promise in reducing surgical pain, improving wound healing, and preventing postoperative complications. However, further research is needed to optimize dosing regimens, minimize adverse effects, and evaluate long-term outcomes. Understanding the complex interactions of the kinin/prostaglandin system in surgical stress and identifying novel therapeutic targets will ultimately contribute to improving patient outcomes and reducing surgical morbidity.",1

"Efficacy of doxazosin in specific hypertensive patient groups. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of doxazosin in specific hypertensive patient groups. A total of 300 patients were included, divided into three groups: obese hypertensive patients, elderly hypertensive patients, and hypertensive patients with renal impairment. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either doxazosin or placebo for a duration of 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the reduction in systolic blood pressure. In the obese group, doxazosin significantly reduced systolic blood pressure compared to placebo (p<0.001). In the elderly group, a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure was also observed with doxazosin (p<0.01). However, in patients with renal impairment, there was no significant difference in systolic blood pressure between the doxazosin and placebo groups (p=0.342). Overall, doxazosin showed efficacy in reducing systolic blood pressure in obese and elderly hypertensive patients, but not in those with renal impairment.",1
"Traumatic and spontaneous extracranial internal carotid artery dissections. Extracranial internal carotid artery dissections (CAD) can result from traumatic or spontaneous causes. Traumatic CAD usually occurs due to direct trauma to the neck or head, while spontaneous CAD is usually associated with connective tissue disorders or vascular abnormalities. This literature review aims to analyze the current understanding and management of both traumatic and spontaneous CAD. Traumatic CAD often presents with symptoms such as headache, neck pain, and stroke. Prompt diagnosis is crucial to prevent ischemic complications. Treatment options include anticoagulation therapy, antiplatelet therapy, endovascular intervention, or surgical reconstruction. Spontaneous CAD is more common in young patients and is often associated with connective tissue disorders such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or fibromuscular dysplasia. Antithrombotic therapy is the mainstay of treatment, and endovascular intervention may be indicated in certain cases. Further research is needed to refine management strategies and improve outcomes for patients with CAD.",1
"Partial laryngectomy after irradiation failure.  Forty-three patients who had partial laryngectomies after radiotherapy were evaluated. This retrospective study evaluated the outcomes of 43 patients who underwent partial laryngectomy following failed radiation therapy. The main objective was to assess the success rate of this procedure and to identify any associated complications. The majority of patients had advanced laryngeal cancer (82%), with the remaining cases being recurrent or persistent disease. The overall success rate of partial laryngectomy in these patients was 74%. Factors associated with successful outcomes included tumor stage, site of involvement, and preoperative vocal cord mobility. The most common postoperative complications were wound infection (28%), wound breakdown (19%), and pharyngocutaneous fistula (14%). However, most of these complications were manageable and did not adversely affect long-term outcomes. In conclusion, partial laryngectomy can be a viable treatment option for patients with failed radiation therapy. Careful patient selection and close postoperative monitoring are essential for optimizing outcomes and minimizing complications.",1
"Magnetic resonance imaging of experimental rat brain tumors: histopathological evaluation. The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect and characterize brain tumors in rats has become increasingly common in preclinical research. However, the histopathological evaluation of these tumors is essential to validate the imaging findings. In this study, we aimed to assess the correlation between MRI features and histopathological characteristics of experimental rat brain tumors. We observed that MRI accurately depicted tumor location, size, and shape. Furthermore, we identified distinct histopathological features, including tumor cell density, necrosis, and angiogenesis, that corresponded to specific MRI signal intensities and enhancement patterns. Our findings demonstrate the value of MRI in visualizing and localizing brain tumors in rats and suggest that specific histopathological features can be correlated with MRI features. This integrated approach holds promise for improving our understanding of brain tumor pathophysiology and for evaluating novel treatment strategies in preclinical models.",1
"Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome.  A clinical case series of 21 patients. Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS) is a rare and potentially life-threatening condition characterized by eosinophilia and myalgia. In this clinical case series, we present findings from 21 patients diagnosed with EMS. The majority of patients were female (85.7%) with a mean age of 45 years.

The most common presenting symptom was severe myalgia, followed by fatigue, rash, and peripheral neuropathy. Eosinophilia was observed in all patients, with a mean absolute eosinophil count of 4,500 cells/μL. The etiology of EMS remains unknown, but a possible association with the consumption of L-tryptophan supplements was reported in some cases.

Diagnosis of EMS requires a high index of suspicion and exclusion of other potential causes of eosinophilia and myalgia. Treatment mainly involves supportive care, including pain management and physical therapy. Corticosteroids may be considered in severe cases.

Our case series highlights the clinical features and diagnostic challenges associated with EMS. Greater awareness among healthcare professionals is crucial for early recognition and appropriate management of this rare syndrome.",1

Shwachman syndrome is a rare inherited disorder characterized by various manifestations, including ichthyosis, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, impaired neutrophil chemotaxis, growth retardation, and metaphyseal dysplasia. We present a case of a patient with extensive skin lesions associated with Shwachman syndrome. Clinical examination revealed scaling and erythematous patches on the trunk and extremities. Histological analysis demonstrated hyperkeratosis, irregular acanthosis, and focal parakeratosis. Ultrastructural examination revealed disorganized keratin filaments and abnormal desmosomes. The patient was managed conservatively with topical emollients and systemic antibiotics for superimposed infection. In conclusion, our case highlights the dermatological features of Shwachman syndrome and emphasizes the importance of early recognition and appropriate management of skin manifestations in patients with this syndrome. Further research is needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the cutaneous manifestations of Shwachman syndrome.",1
"mtDNA depletion with variable tissue expression: a novel genetic abnormality in mitochondrial diseases. mtDNA depletion with variable tissue expression is a newly identified genetic abnormality seen in patients with mitochondrial diseases. This condition is characterized by a decrease in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content in affected tissues, leading to impaired mitochondrial function. The clinical manifestations of mtDNA depletion with variable tissue expression are diverse and depend on the specific tissues involved. Common symptoms include muscle weakness, neurological impairments, liver dysfunction, and metabolic abnormalities. Diagnosis is often challenging, as the presentation can be subtle or nonspecific. Molecular genetic testing, such as mtDNA copy number quantification and nuclear gene sequencing, is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Management of patients with mtDNA depletion with variable tissue expression focuses on symptomatic treatment and supportive care, as no curative treatments currently exist. Further research is needed to better understand the pathogenesis and develop targeted therapies for this genetic abnormality.",1
"SPECT imaging of pediatric brain tumor with hexakis (methoxyisobutylisonitrile) technetium (I). In this study, we aimed to evaluate the feasibility and potential diagnostic utility of hexakis (methoxyisobutylisonitrile) technetium (I) (Tc-MIBI) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging in pediatric brain tumor patients. A total of 35 children with suspected brain tumors underwent Tc-MIBI SPECT imaging, which was interpreted by two experienced nuclear medicine physicians. The results were compared to histopathological findings or clinical follow-up. Tc-MIBI SPECT imaging successfully identified brain tumors in 31 out of 35 cases, resulting in a sensitivity of 88.6%. The specificity was 100% as there were no false-positive findings. Additionally, Tc-MIBI SPECT imaging allowed for the detection of metastatic disease in 75% of cases. Our findings suggest that Tc-MIBI SPECT imaging holds promise as a non-invasive and valuable tool for the evaluation of pediatric brain tumors, providing essential information for treatment planning and prognosis assessment. Further large-scale studies are warranted to confirm these results and establish standardized protocols for its clinical implementation.",1
"Pulmonary acinar development in diaphragmatic hernia. Diaphragmatic hernia is a rare congenital anomaly associated with pulmonary hypoplasia. We present a case report of a newborn with diaphragmatic hernia who underwent surgical repair. Post-operative imaging revealed persistent lung hypoplasia, characterized by decreased number and size of pulmonary acini. The histopathological analysis confirmed the presence of immature and simplified pulmonary acini, suggesting impaired lung development. Pulmonary acinar development plays a crucial role in gas exchange and respiratory function, and its alteration in diaphragmatic hernia can lead to respiratory distress and poor outcomes. Further studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying pulmonary acinar development in diaphragmatic hernia and identify potential interventions to optimize lung growth and function in affected infants.",1

This case report describes a 10-year-old male with developmental dysmnesia and poor reading skills. The patient exhibited difficulties in acquiring and retaining new information, as well as autobiographical memory deficits. Neuropsychological testing revealed normal language skills and working memory, but impaired episodic memory functions. Brain imaging showed no structural abnormalities. This case highlights the co-occurrence of developmental dysmnesia and poor reading skills, suggesting a potential link between the two. Further research is needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms and develop effective interventions for this unique combination of cognitive impairments.",1
"Treatment of vaginal candidiasis: orally or vaginally? Vaginal candidiasis continues to be the most common cause of vaginal discharge. Vaginal candidiasis, commonly known as a yeast infection, is a prevalent cause of vaginal discharge. The choice of treatment route, either oral or vaginal, remains a topic of debate. The aim of this study was to determine the most effective treatment strategy. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials was conducted, comparing the efficacy of oral and vaginal antifungal medications in treating vaginal candidiasis. The results showed that both routes of administration achieved similar clinical cure rates. However, oral treatment was associated with a higher rate of adverse effects compared to vaginal administration. Based on these findings, vaginal antifungal medications may be the preferred treatment option due to their comparable efficacy and lower risk of adverse effects. Further research is needed to explore individual patient preferences and cost-effectiveness of the two treatment approaches.",1
"Pseudocyst of the auricle: successful treatment with intracartilaginous trichloroacetic acid and button bolsters. Pseudocyst of the auricle is a rare condition that presents as a fluid-filled swelling of the auricle. Current treatment options include aspiration or surgical excision, but these have a high recurrence rate. This case report presents a successful treatment using a combination of intracartilaginous trichloroacetic acid (TCA) injection and button bolsters. Two patients with pseudocyst of the auricle were treated using this approach, resulting in complete resolution of the pseudocyst without recurrence. Intracartilaginous TCA injection helped to induce scarring and fibrosis, while button bolsters provided support and maintained pressure on the affected area. This novel treatment approach shows promise for the management of pseudocyst of the auricle.",1
"Immunohistochemical demonstration of pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor in normal and neoplastic colonic mucosa. Pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (PSTI) is a protein that plays a role in protecting the pancreas from damage caused by digestive enzymes. Recent studies have suggested that PSTI may also have a role in the development of colorectal cancer. This study aimed to investigate the presence of PSTI in normal and neoplastic colonic mucosa using immunohistochemistry. 

Tissue samples from normal colonic mucosa and various stages of colorectal cancer were obtained from patients undergoing surgery. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using an anti-PSTI antibody to identify the presence of PSTI in the tissue samples. 

The results showed that PSTI was present in normal colonic mucosa, with staining primarily localized to the cytoplasm of goblet cells. In neoplastic colonic mucosa, PSTI expression was observed to be significantly decreased or absent, particularly in advanced stages of colorectal cancer. 

These findings suggest that PSTI may play a role in the development and progression of colorectal cancer. Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic implications of PSTI in colorectal cancer.",1
