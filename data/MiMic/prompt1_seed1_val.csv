"PA AND LATERAL CHEST, [**2102-4-16**] 
OMPARISON:  [**2102-4-14**]. 
FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Airspace consolidation in the left lower lobe has worsened and is concerning for an evolving pneumonia.  Subtle hazy ground-glass opacity lateral to right hilum could reflect an additional site of infection.  Bronchial wall thickening is mild and suggest coexisting airways infection or inflammation.  Small pleural effusions are present bilaterally, left greater than right. 
IMPRESSION:  Evolving pneumonia in left lower lobe as well as possible new site of infection in right perihilar region.  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 35223**] was telephoned with these findings on [**2102-4-16**] at 10 a.m.",0
