CLINICAL INDICATION: PICC line placement. 
A right sided PICC line has been removed, a left PICC line has been placed, and forces into the left side of the neck. A tracheostomy tube and nasogastric tube remain in place. Pleural and parenchymal abnormalities described on the earlier radiograph of the same day are unchanged in the interval.

MANDIBLE, FOUR VIEWS:  No Panorex view obtained.  The site of symptoms is not indicated.  A collar is in place, which likely limits positioning. 
No displaced mandibular fracture is identified.  Assessment of the TM joints is not optimal on these views, but no gross derangement is identified on the right side.  The left side is only seen on the frontal view due to positioning.

NASOINTESTINAL TUBE PLACEMENT:  The left naris was anesthetized with lidocaine jelly.  An 8 French [**Location (un) 1213**]-[**Doctor First Name 948**] feeding tube was advanced until the tip reached the second portion of the duodenum.

Small bilateral pleural effusions.",0
"INDICATION: New onset right hemiparesis and aphasia with status post TPA. 
COMPARISON: MRI of same day. 
TECHNIQUE: CT of the head without IV contrast. 
FINDINGS: There are no intra or extraaxial hemorrhage, edema, or shift of normal midline structures. The ventricles are symmetric in size. There is tortuousity of the vertebral and basilar arteries as was seen on the MRA.

THYROID BIOPSY 
Initial ultrasound shows a normal left lobe and isthmus. 
Occupying the majority of the right lobe is a nodule that measures 5.1 x 2.8 x 2.5 cm.  This nodule is isoechoic and shows some echogenic foci, some with shadowing, some with comet tailing.  The nodule has modest vascularity.

"PORTABLE CHEST: 
CLINICAL INDICATION:   Right pig-tail catheter placement. 
Since the recent study, a right pig-tail pleural catheter has been placed, with associated resolution of a previously noted large right pleural effusion.  No definite pneumothorax is identified on this supine radiograph.  However, the right hemidiaphragms appear sharper than the left and is difficult to exclude a basilar pneumothorax as a cause of this finding.  A Swan-Ganz catheter remains in the right ventricular outflow tract, and a left subclavian vascular catheter and nasogastric tube remain in satisfactory position.  An endotracheal tube terminates at the thoracic inlet level.  Minor atelectatic changes are noted at the left base.

AP PORTABLE SUPINE RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST: There is stable cardiomegaly. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged in appearance. There are bilateral layering pleural effusions. The bilateral perihilar haziness and patchy opacities could be partially due to patient positioning. ETT is seen approximately 3 cm above the carina. A left subclavian line is seen with its tip at the junction of the brachiocephalic and SVC. Soft tissue and osseous structures are unremarkable.

"INDICATIONS:  Labored breathing. Endotracheal tube placement. 
Comparison is made to previous films from  one day earlier. 
An endotracheal tube has been placed, in satisfactory position.  A nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragms and the right PICC line remains in place. The examination of the cardiovascular status of the patient is limited due to low lung volumes and respiratory motion. With this limitation in mind there is no gross evidence of pulmonary edema.

The left central venous catheter terminates in the distal left brachiocephalic vein.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The right lung remains clear.

TECHNIQUE:  Axially acquired images were obtained through the cervical spine without contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were also displayed. 
FINDINGS:  No fracture is identified.  Alignment is maintained.  Apparent mild thickening of the prevertebral soft tissues is likely due to intubation and NG tube placement.  Visualized soft tissues of the neck are within normal limits. CT does not provide intrathecal detail comparable that of MRI.  Lung apices demonstrate emphysema. 
Degenerative changes are noted throughout the cervical spine with moderate anterior osteophytes and calcification of the anterior longitudinal ligament. Small posterior osteophytes are noted at C4-5 and cause mild canal narrowing.

However, the pulmonary vessels are unremarkable and do not indicate cardiac failure at this time. However, there is some blunting of the costophrenic angles and there is also a suggestion of some left lower lobe collapse/consolidation behind the heart. A small effusion is noted along the left lateral chest wall. A pacemaker with dual chamber electrodes is again noted, in good position.

AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There has been interval insertion of a right internal jugular central venous line with the tip in the mid-right atrium. The nasogastric tube tip is below the diaphragm, along with a sideport. Heart size appears slightly more generous, but is likely within normal limits due to differences in technique. There is also increased prominence of the pulmonary vasculature. There is also mild decrease in lung volumes, likely due to inspiratory effort.

There is however an increasing confluent area of opacity in the left retrocardiac region. 
IMPRESSION: 
1)  Decreased perihilar haziness, likely due to improving pulmonary edema considering the provided clinical history. 
2)  Worsening confluent opacity in left retrocardiac region.  Differential diagnosis includes a resolving asymmetric area of dependent pulmonary edema, vs. an acute aspiration or atelectasis.",0

"INDICATION:  80-year-old male for pre-MRI evaluation.  
COMPARISON:  None. A single AP view of the chest reveals an advancement of the right internal jugular central venous catheter, which now resides in the distal superior vena cava/right atrium. The previous examination from [**2151-8-19**] serves as a comparison. There is an interval increase in air space consolidations in both the left lower lobe and right lung, which may indicate either aspiration pneumonia or respiratory failure. The previously identified right pleural effusion appears unchanged, considering potential differences in positioning. The tracheostomy tube and pig-tail catheter remain in place. Additionally, there is significant deformation of the chest. 

In summary, the findings suggest: 
1) Advancement of the right internal jugular central venous catheter. 
2) Increased bilateral multifocal air space consolidations, indicating potential aspiration pneumonia or respiratory failure.

INDICATION: An 80-year-old male requires pre-MRI evaluation. No previous scans are available for comparison.

"INDICATION:  46 year old male with [**Location (un) **]-[**Location (un) **] syndrome.   The patient is now with persistent fever. The patient, a 46-year-old male with [**Location (un) **]-[**Location (un) **] syndrome, presents with persistent fever. A chest radiograph was performed to assess the placement of a newly inserted Dobbhoff catheter. The catheter is satisfactorily positioned in the distal stomach.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  Evaluation of opacity in the right lower lobe.  
COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to prior portable chest one view examination dated [**2197-1-24**], time 0235. Interval comparison of the portable chest shows persistence of opacity in the right lower lobe. The cardiac and mediastinal contours appear unchanged and normal. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The other lung fields and bony structures remain within normal limits. The findings are consistent with a persistent infiltrate in the right lower lobe without significant interval change.
