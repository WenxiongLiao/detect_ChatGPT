"INDICATION:  72-year-old woman with trach adjustment status post multiple bronchs with persistent fevers.  Evaluate after IVF. 
COMPARISONS:  16:26 today. 
AP UPRIGHT CHEST:  The tracheostomy tube is unchanged in position with the tip approximately 2 cm above the carina.  There is a new consolidation involving the right lung, predominantly the mid and lower lung fields, with air bronchograms.  There is associated silhouette phenomenon with the lateral aspect of the right hemidiaphragm, indicating lower lobe involvement.  The heart size remains normal and the left lung remains clear. 
IMPRESSION:  New consolidation in the right lung.  Given the suspected presence of pneumonia on prior radiographs and the interval fluid resuscitation, the findings are most consistent with a developing pneumonia that has blossomed after the fluid resuscitation.",0
"PROCEDURE:  Chest PA and lateral on [**2172-5-12**]. 
COMPARISON:  [**2172-5-12**] at 10:08. 
HISTORY:  72-year-old man status post chest tube removal, rule out pneumothorax. 
FINDINGS: 
In the interim, two chest tubes from the right side has been removed with no pneumothorax but with worsening effusion especially the loculated part in the right costal surface, right major fissure and right minor fissure and at the base.  Subclavian line is stable in location terminating at the caval/atrial junction.  The left lung is clear.  The heart size is normal. 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Status post removal of the two chest tubes with no pneumothorax but with worsening loculated pleural effusion.",0
"HISTORY:  Chest tube, poor gas exchange. 
Compared to study dated [**2123-1-8**], lines and tubes remain in place.  A left apical pneumothorax is not substantially different.  Subcutaneous emphysema is again noted and air tracks along the left hemidiaphragm has been noted previously.  Compared to prior film there is slight increase in density in the left mid lung field and could represent a developing air space process.  No other interval changes are demonstrated.  Continued follow up is recommended. 
IMPRESSION: 1. Stable left apical pneumothorax. Slight increase in density of left mid lung which should be followed up to evaluate for possible evolving air space process. 2. Subcutaneous emphysema.",0
"CLINICAL INDICATION:  Postop day 1 following orthotopic liver transplant. 
The liver transplant is normal in size, echogenicity and architecture.  Color flow and pulse Doppler assessment shows excellent flow in the hepatic veins, portal veins and hepatic arteries.  Resistive indices in the hepatic arteries range around 0.5.  There is good upstroke in the right and left hepatic arteries and full patency of all portal and hepatic veins.  The inferior vena cava also shows normal color flow and pulse Doppler characteristics.  There is a hyperechoic shadowing area beneath the right lobe that corresponds to an area of Surgicel.  A small right pleural effusion is noted, but there are no peritransplant fluid collections. 
CONCLUSION:  Satisfactory ultrasound on Doppler appearance of the recent liver transplant.",0
"INDICATION:  78-year-old woman with right temporal bleed and poor VA in the right eye. 
TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT. 
FINDINGS:  Compared with the examination of [**2130-4-8**], there has been no change in the large right basal ganglia intraparenchymal hemorrhage with mass effect upon the ipsilateral lateral ventricle.  A small convex hyperdensity at the right frontal convexity, near the vertex, either represents a small meningioma or a tiny subdural hematoma.  This has been unchanged since [**4-7**], [**2130**]. There is no evidence of herniation.  The ambient cistern is present and normal. 
IMPRESSION:  No change from the prior examination in the large right basal ganglia hemorrhage.",0
"INDICATION: Status post line change. 
FINDINGS: Portable AP chest radiograph.  Conmparison to portable AP chest radiograph of some day at 8:54 a.m.  Bilateral chest tubes in position, which are unchanged from prior chest radiograph.  Endotracheal tube in satisfactory position.  NG tube terminating below the diaphragm.  Right subclavian line at the cavoatrial junction.  Left subclavian Swann-Ganz terminating in the left MPA.

Previously noted opacities at the left base remain unchanged. 
IMPRESSION: Lines in good position.  Tiny left apical pneumothorax.  Left base opacities remain unchanged.",0
"CHEST PORTABLE AP 
COMPARISON:  None. 
HISTORY:  Anorexia nervosa with NSVT, evaluate for abnormal cardiac morphology or signs of infection. 
FINDINGS: 
There are low lung volumes.  The cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Apparent increased hazy opacity in the right mid to lower lung zone likely represents a combination of atelectasis and overlying soft tissues. This could be further evaluated with dedicated PA and lateral.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The osseous structures are grossly unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process. Right lung hazy opacity likely represents combination of superimposition of soft tissues and atelectasis.",0
"HISTORY: Left upper lobe and left lower lobe infiltrate. Status post CABG. 
CHEST AP PORTABLE: There is interval placement of a left sided chest tube, with the tip terminating in the left apex. There is a tiny PTX noted at the left apex. Also noted is placement of ET tube and NG tube, both of which are in satisfactory position. Also noted is a left IJ Swan-Ganz catheter, terminating in the main pulmonary artery. Ill-defined opacity is noted in the left lung zone. Sternal wires are noted, consistent with the patient's history of CABG. 
IMPRESSION: Post op CABG appearance, with a tiny PTX noted at the left apex.",0
"HISTORY:  [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 945**].  Evaluate widened mediastinum. 
Two views.  Comparison with the previous study done [**2141-12-23**].  The patient is status post median sternotomy and [**Month/Day/Year 945**] as before.  There is increased density at the left base consistent with atelectasis or consolidation unchanged. Streaky density in the lower right lung is consistent with subsegmental atelectasis as well.  The costophrenic sulci now appear blunted.  Mediastinal structures are unchanged.  A carotid sheath has been withdrawn.  A PICC line remains in place. 
IMPRESSION:  Blunting of the costophrenic sulci consistent with small pleural effusions which may have increased or redistributed since the prior examination.  No other significant change.",0
"PROCEDURE:  Chest portable AP on [**2142-1-26**]. 
COMPARISON:  [**2142-1-25**]. 
HISTORY:  A 74-year-old man status post pacemaker revision.  Please evaluate for interval change. 
FINDINGS:  The old pacemaker has been removed and replaced by a pacemaker/ defibrillator with atrial lead and ventricular lead in a satisfactory location.  The patient is status post cardiothoracic surgery with cardiomegaly and pulmonary venous congestion which is mild.  There is mild left pleural effusion.  No right pleural effusion is noted. 
IMPRESSION: 1.  Status post placement of a new defibrillator on the right side with no pneumothorax. 2.  Cardiomegaly with pulmonary venous congestion and a small left pleural effusion.",0
"INDICATION:  Right IJ line placement, history of polio, respiratory insufficiency. 
COMPARISON:  [**2151-8-19**] 
FINDINGS:  A single portable AP view of the chest shows a right sided IJ central venous line, which appears to have been advanced several cm and is now in the distal SVC/right atrium.  There has also been interval increase in the left lower lobe and right sided air space consolidations, representing pneumonia vs. failure.  Right sided pleural effusion seen on the last exam is probably unchanged, allowing for differences in positioning.  Tracheostomy tube and pig-tail catheter remain in place. Again noted is marked deformity of the chest. 
IMPRESSION: 
1)  Advancement of right IJ central venous catheter. 2)  Increase in bilateral multifocal air space consolidations, representing aspiration pneumonia vs. failure.",0
"REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with tracheostomy and history of subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**2141-10-24**]. 
The tracheostomy is in unchanged standard position.  The right PICC line tip isdifficult to indentify  and potentially may be in the right atrium. The NG tube passes below the diaphragm most likely terminating in the stomach. 
Slight increase in bilateral perihilar opacities is demonstrated, right more than left which might represent worsening of pulmonary edema giving it symmetric appearance and relatively rapid change.  No sizeable pleural effusion is identified. 
IMPRESSION:  Possibly too distal position of the right PICC line.  Evaluation with repeated radiograph, AP and lateral view would be recommended for precise location of the tip. 
Mild worsening of the perihilar opacities might represent developing pulmonary edema.",0
"INDICATION:  72-year-old man with right hemithorax status post VATS today, dropping hematocrit, hypertensive, reaccumulation of hemothorax. 
COMPARISON:  [**2172-5-7**], at 4:42 p.m. 
SINGLE AP SEMI-UPRIGHT RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST AT 8:30 P.M.:  There has been interval reaccumulation of multiloculated right pleural effusions which may represent hemothorax.  These collections are noted in the right basal, lateral, apical and paramediastinal regions.  There is also some fluid within the right minor fissure.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is partly obscured on the right side due to the right pleural effusion.  A right subclavian catheter is noted to terminate within the distal SVC. 
IMPRESSION:  Reaccumulation of multiloculated right pleural effusion as described above.  Small amount of right chest wall subcutaneous emphysema, likely secondary to chest tube insertion.",0
"HISTORY:  A 58-year-old gentleman with mitral disorder.  Evaluation of the carotid arteries was requested. 
TECHNIQUE:  Evaluation of the bilateral extracranial carotid arteries was performed with B-mode, color and spectral Doppler ultrasound. 
FINDINGS:  A moderate amount of plaque was seen in the bilateral internal carotid arteries, with B-mode ultrasound. 
On the right side, peak systolic velocities were 95 cm/sec for the internal carotid artery, and 57 cm/sec for the common carotid artery.  The right ICA/CCA ratio was 1.7. 
On the left side, peak systolic velocities were 201 cm/sec for the ICA and 55 cm/sec for the CCA.  The left ICA/CCA ratio was 3.7. 
Both vertebral arteries presented antegrade flow.

TECHNIQUE:  AP supine single view of the chest. 
FINDINGS:  There is an ET tube in good position.  There is a Swan-Ganz catheter with the tip in the pulmonary artery trunk. The patient is status post AVR.  There are 4 mediastinal tubes.  There is an NG tube with the tip in the stomach. Pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits without evidence of CHF or fluid overload.  There is left lower lobe opacity which could represent atelectasis vs. aspiration. 
IMPRESSION: 1)  Lines and tubes in appropriate position.  No evidence of pneumothorax. 2)  Left pleural effusion and probably left lower lobe atelectasis vs. aspiration.",0
"STUDY:  Single portable AP chest radiograph. 
INDICATION:  CVA, on permanent tracheostomy with intermittent hypotension. 
COMPARISON:  CT chest [**2162-6-13**], chest radiograph [**2162-6-10**]. 
FINDINGS:  Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are consistent with previous coronary artery bypass grafting.  Despite mild lordotic positioning the cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  There is a right-sided pacemaker with single lead terminating in the right atrium.  There is no evidence of acute pulmonary edema.  There is a moderate-to-large right pleural effusion and a smaller left effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  The hilar structures appear within normal limits.  Tracheostomy tube remains in expected position. 
IMPRESSION:  Pleural effusions as before without evidence of acute pulmonary edema.",0
"INDICATION:  Gunshot wound, exploratory laparotomy, bilateral chest tubes, and spinal fusion. 
COMPARISON:  [**2144-10-15**]. 
SINGLE-VIEW CHEST, AP SUPINE:  The ET and NG tubes are in unchanged and appropriate positions.  There are again two right-sided chest tubes and one left-sided chest tube.  There is a probable small basilar pneumothorax on this supine film.  There are again scattered parenchymal opacities, which are unchanged from the previous study. 
IMPRESSION: 1. Probable small basilar pneumothorax on this supine film. 2. Scattered parenchymal opacities, which are unchanged.  These likely represent contusions and/or aspiration pneumonia.",0
"PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY: 
HISTORY:  10 day old girl who was born prematurely and has evolving chronic lung disease.  Evaluate lungs and positioning of endotracheal tube. 
COMPARISON STUDIES:  Portable chest X-ray from earlier on [**2141-9-7**]. 
FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube tip is now just above the level of the carina with the patient's head flexed.  Left arm PICC is without significant change in position.  Again seen are findings consistent with chronic lung disease. The lungs are less well aerated; however, there appears to be an interval increase in patchy alveolar opacities with a central predominance.  No other significant interval changes. 
IMPRESSION: 1)  Suboptimal positioning of the endotracheal tube.  Recommend repositioning with the tip near to the thoracic inlet. 2)  Increased pulmonary edema vs central atelectasis superimposed on chronic lung disease.",0
"HISTORY:  Right-sided PICC line placement.  Assess position. 
SINGLE VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Comparison is made to previous exam of one day earlier.  There has been interval placement of a right-sided PICC, with the tip overlying the cavoatrial junction.  The tip of a left-sided central venous catheter is unchanged in position.  The cardiac silhouette and mediastinal/hilar contours are stable. There has been slight resolution of the previously described patchy opacities of the right lung. The left lung is unchanged.  Soft tissues and osseous structures are unremarkable.

"PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON [**2-12**] 
HISTORY:  89-year-old man with multifocal pneumonia and continued oxygen requirement. 
IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to [**1-29**] through 30: 
Severe multifocal pneumonia may be minimally better today than it was on [**2-7**], generalized haziness is new, moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and the caliber of the mediastinum, have both increased suggesting cardiac induced pulmonary edema and mediastinal venous dilatation.  Moderate right pleural effusion unchanged.  Moderate left pleural effusion may have increased.  Left PIC line can be traced as far as the junction of the brachiocephalic veins, but the tip is indistinct.  A small metal foreign body or dense calcification in the soft tissues of the sternal notch is longstanding.",0
"INDICATION:  67 y/o man with severe CAD.  Status post IABP. 
COMPARISON:  [**2180-2-11**]. 
CHEST:  A single AP chest radiograph is provided.  There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube with tip terminating below the thoracic inlet.  A right sided IJ line has been placed with tip terminating within the descending right pulmonary artery.  There has also been interval placement of bilateral chest tubes.  An intraaortic pump has been placed.  The tip is approximately 9 cm below the aortic arch. 
There has been interval sternotomy since the prior exam.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but unchanged from previous exam.  There has been interval resolution of the bilateral pleural effusions.  Bibasilar atelectasis is identified. 
IMPRESSION:  1)  Interval sternotomy since prior exam. 
2)  The IABP is approximately 9 cm below the aortic arch.",0
"COMPARISON:  [**2144-4-2**]. 
INDICATION:  Status post AVR and CABG. 
The patient is status post median sternotomy and aortic valve replacement.  An endotracheal tube is present, terminating 5 cm above the carina.  A Swan-Ganz catheter terminates at the junction of the main and right pulmonary arteries, and a nasogastric tube terminates in the proximal stomach.  Mediastinal drain is also noted.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours appear slightly widened, likely due to recent surgery.  There is new patchy opacity present in the left retrocardiac region.  The lungs otherwise appear clear.  No pneumothorax is identified. 
IMPRESSION:  Postoperative appearance of the chest, as described.  No pneumothorax.",0
"AP CHEST 5:08 A.M, [**10-3**]. 
HISTORY:  Hypoxic respiratory failure. 
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**9-28**] through 5: 
Although some of the opacification in the right lung has improved since [**10-2**], there are new, more nodular areas of consolidation at the left, concerning for multifocal infection on a background of persistent mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema, not necessarily cardiogenic.  There is no pleural effusion.  Heart is partially obscured by the diaphragm but does not appear to have progressed beyond top normal size in the interim.  There is no pleural effusion currently or indication of pneumothorax.  Tip of the ET tube is at the upper margin of the clavicles.  Tip of a right supraclavicular central venous line projects over the superior cavoatrial junction.",0
"HISTORY: Subdural hematoma. 
TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast head CT. 
FINDINGS: Comparison is made to the prior noncontrast head CT dated [**11-8**], [**2168**]. There is no interval change. The right-sided subdural hematoma is unchanged in size, without any evidence of rebleeding. Small amount of left- sided subarachnoid blood remains present. Since it is unusual for small subarachnoid hematomas to persist for multiple weeks, it is possible that this patient had siderosis, which is not usually detectable by CT. There is no hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures. Pneumocephalus is again noted, secondary to prior craniotomy. 
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of right subdural hematoma without evidence of rebleeding. Persistent left subarachnoid hematoma versus siderosis.",0

COMPARISON:  [**2178-4-16**]. 
FINDINGS:  ETT has been removed.  The right subclavian central venous line tip has been pulled back, and is now in the right subclavian vein.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  There has been interval increase in patchy density in the right upper and mid lung zones, as well as in the left lower lung zone.  This could represent either atelectasis or infiltrate. Bilateral pleural effusions are likely.  There is no pneumothorax.  The bones are unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in patchy density at the right upper and mid lung zones and at the left base, consistent with atelectasis or infiltrate. Correlate clinically.",0
"STUDY:  CT-guided pleural biopsy. 
INDICATION:  The patient with multifocal pleural abnormalities on left side and history of both primary renal and thyroid carcinoma.  For evaluation. 
TECHNIQUE:  Informed consent was obtained from the patient.  Preprocedure timeout was performed to confirm patient identity and indication for examination.  Under CT fluoroscopic guidance, a 17-gauge coaxial system was advanced into the largest anterior pleural nodule.  Following this, two 18- gauge core samples were obtained.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate complications.  Onsite cytology showed positive touch prep scan.  No pneumothorax was noted postprocedure.

"INDICATION:  50-year-old male with chest pain radiating to back.  Evaluate for pneumothorax or mediastinal widening. 
COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of [**2176-2-24**]. 
FINDINGS:  Frontal view of the chest was obtained.  There is near-complete opacification of left hemithorax with slight rightward shift of the mediastinal structures.  This is most compatible with a large amount of left pleural fluid.  The right lung is clear.  Right heart border is unremarkable. Osseous structures are unremarkable.  No radiopaque foreign bodies. 
IMPRESSION:  Opacified left hemithorax with slight rightward shift of mediastinal structures, compatible with large left pleural effusion.

"PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST: 
Compared to previous study of 1 day earlier. 
INDICATION: Fevers. 
An ETT remains in the low position, terminating approximately 1.5 cm above the carina with neck in flexed position. Central line and NG tube are unchanged. There is stable widening of the cardiac and mediastinal contours. There is mild perihilar haziness present, possibly due to crowding of vessels related to low lung volumes.

TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT scan. 
FINDINGS:  Compared to the previous study of [**12-3**], there is no change in the extent of the relatively small medially positioned left cerebellar hemorrhage which extends to the 4th ventricle.  In the interval between studies, a ventricular drain has been placed, whose tip adjoins the septum pellucidum.  There is a small amount of gas adjacent to the frontal lobes. This collection presumably is post-surgical in origin. 
Finally, the drainage procedure has resulted in a mild decrease in supratentorial ventricular size but more impressively in the region of the temporal horns. 
CONCLUSION:  S/P drain placement with reduction in ventricular size as noted above.",0

INDICATION:  Status post aortic valve replacement. 
The patient is status post median sternotomy and aortic valve replacement. Various lines and tubes are present, in satisfactory position.  Lung volumes are low.  This factor, combined with postoperative status of the patient, likely accounts for slight widening of the cardiac and mediastinal contours. The expiratory nature of the radiograph accentuates the pulmonary vascularity and may account for associated perihilar haziness as well, but it is difficult to exclude a component of mild fluid overload.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion.

Right basilar calcified nodules and calcified mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are redemonstrated, compatible with prior granulomatous disease. There is perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness, compatible with mild pulmonary edema, which has worsened in the interval.  A small pleural effusion on the right demonstrates a component which is loculated laterally.  The size of this effusion is similar compared to the prior study.  Patchy opacities at lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax. 
IMPRESSION:  Mild congestive heart failure, slightly worse in the interval, with small right pleural effusion which is partially loculated laterally.                                                                       DFDdp",0

Pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits.  A density is seen superimposed on the heart, which may represent a possible retrocardiac density. Alternatively, this may just represent purely cardiac enlargement. No definite effusions or pneumothorax is present, however, the patient's head obscures full visualization of the apices. 
IMPRESSION: 
1)  Cardiomegaly without evidence of congestive heart failure. 
2)  Superimposed opacity over the cardiac silhouette, which may represent a retrocardiac process (including atelectasis or infection) or could just represent cardiac enlargement. A lateral view would be helpful in localizing this opacity and determining its significance.

INDICATION:  82-year-old woman with history of asthma, worsening dyspnea, hypoxia, no fever or cough. 
COMPARISON:  Several prior studies, most recent dated [**2134-7-30**]. 
FINDINGS:  Mild cardiomegaly is stable.  Right pleural effusion has slightly increased in size, with small amount of fluid seen in the minor fissure, adjacent density most likely represents compressive atelectasis. 
The aorta contains atherosclerotic arch calcification.  There is no pulmonary edema.  There is trace left pleural fluid.  There is no pneumothorax. 
IMPRESSION:  Interval increase of a right pleural effusion and adjacent opacity, which probably represents compressive atelectasis rather than pneumonic consolidation in this clinical setting.  No frank pulmonary edema. Trace left pleural effusion.

Significant interval worsening of aeration, suggesting pulmonary edema.",0
"Compared to [**2121-7-25**]. 
CLINICAL INDICATION: Central line placement. 
A left subclavian central venous catheter is in satisfactory position within the superior vena cava. There has been interval further opacification of the right hemithorax which now completely opacified. Rightward rotation of the patient limits accurate assessment for mediastinal shift, but there is no definite shift towards the opposite, left hand side. Blurring of the pulmonary vasculature and the left hemithorax is thought to be due to respiratory motion. 
IMPRESSION: Complete opacification of right hemithorax, likely due to a combination of a large pleural effusion and collapse of the right lung. Repeat nonrotated film may be helpful for more complete assessment. Vascular catheter in satisfactory position.",0

There are no prior films for comparison, but comparison is made to a scout image from a CT of the neck from [**2159-2-24**]. 
A tracheostomy tube appears in satisfactory position.  The examination is limited due to low lung volumes and excessive image noise.  There is prominence of the superior mediastinum, which is most likely due to accentuation by technique.  The heart size is within normal limits.  The lungs demonstrate minimal patchy opacities at the right base and are otherwise clear.  No definite pneumothorax is identified.

INDICATION:  75 year old female with cough and decreased sats when eating. 
FINDINGS:  The radiologist was present to provide the speech pathologist with assistance during video oropharyngeal swallow examination. Video imaging was performed during swallowing to evaluate solid and liquid consistencies. 
There is mild loss of bolus control with premature spillover and intermittent penetration during swallowing of nectars. However, in this instance, there is spontaneous cough with clearing. With thin liquids, aspiration is seen and spontaneous cough is ineffective at clearing material. Cued cough improves clearing of material. Aspiration is due to mild reduced laryngeal elevation as well as reduced valve closure. Swallowing to puree consistences was unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION:  Aspiration to thin liquids with ineffective spontaneous cough secondary to mild reduced laryngeal elevation and valve closure. Please see the speech pathologist report for recommendations and further details.",0

There are bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.  There is central opacity and indistinctness of the pulmonary vessels, representing mild CHF.  There are bilateral calcified pleural plaques. 
IMPRESSION:  1)  Lines and tubes as above.  2)  Bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis.  3)  Mild CHF.  4)  No significant change in the lung fields compared with [**2178-10-18**].",0
"INDICATION: Desaturation of oxygenation and abnormal breath sounds. 
COMPARISON: No old studies available for comparison at this time.  A prior report indicates small bilateral pleural effusions. 
CHEST, PA AND LATERAL:  The current study shows coarsening and prominence of the pulmonary vasculature with bilateral effusions. The pattern is most consistent with congestive heart failure.  Nasogastric tube is seen extending below the diaphragm and the patient shows evidence of CABG changes.  Left hemidiaphragm is not well seen and the possibility of subsegmental atelectasis is likely. The lateral view is somewhat under penetrated and followup is recommended.  Evaluate for possible progression of airspace process at the left base.

IMPRESSION:  Interval reaccumulation of moderate-to-large left pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis of the left base.",0
"INDICATION:  Respiratory distress.  Evaluate for pneumonia or other infiltrates. 
FINDINGS:  A single AP supine view.  Comparison study dated [**2199-1-28**].  There is again evidence of fairly marked LV enlargement of the heart, associated with dilatation and unfolding of the aorta.  The pulmonary vessels are within normal limits, and there is no evidence of heart failure. There is elevation of the left hemidiaphragm laterally with blunting of the CP angle.  Slight blunting of the right CP angle may also be present, associated with some accentuation of the minor interlobar fissure.  The ET tube, NG tube, and the right IJ central line all remain in good position.

FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of [**2112-1-18**].  The position of a left-sided PICC line is unchanged.  There exists moderate degree of perivascular haze and bilateral plate atelectasis on the bases, but no new parenchymal infiltrates have developed.  Comparison of the vascular pattern suggests that the previously described moderate CHF has improved slightly.  No pneumothorax is present and no evidence of pleural effusion is present as the lateral pleural sinuses remain free. 
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of progressing CHF.  Comparison of study suggests mild regression of CHF during the last 24 hours.",0
"INDICATION:  Rising creatinine. 
FINDINGS: 
The kidneys are normal in size and echogenicity without focal without focal mass or hydronephrosis.  Punctate foci of echogenicity within the left renal hilum may represent nonobstructing stones versus crystals.  Right kidney measures 12.5 cm long, and the left kidney measures 11.4 cm long.  The left kidney is not visualized in its entirety. 
Both renal arteries are patent.  Resistive indices within the right kidney measure 0.7-0.8.  Resistive indices within the left kidney measures 0.6-0.8. Venous waveforms are identified within both kidneys.

"INDICATION:  48-year-old man status post motor vehicle collision, preop evaluation for PEG tube placement. 
COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated [**2185-9-9**]. 
SINGLE PORTABLE AP SUPINE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There is a poor inspiratory effort.  Note is made of cervical fusion hardware.  There is a persistent left lower lobe consolidation with air bronchograms, which obscures the diaphragm on that side.  This is likely atelectasis with a possible small pleural effusion.  Again seen is a tracheostomy tube as well as a nasogastric tube with the tip terminating in the fundus.  The mediastinal and cardiac contours are unchanged since the prior exam. 
IMPRESSION: Persistent left lower lobe consolidation which likely represents atelectasis with a possible small left pleural effusion.",0
"PROCEDURE:  Chest PA and lateral. 
REASON FOR EXAM:  82-year-old man with left lower lobe effusion, left VATS drainage and recent removal of Pleurx catheter. 
FINDINGS: Since the previous chest radiograph dated [**2176-7-9**], the left- sided pleural drain has been removed and the left sided effusion and left lower lobe opacities and atelectasis are unchanged. Increased ground-glass opacification in the right lower lobe may be partially accounted for by a reduced inspiratory effort with crowding of perivascular structures suggesting that the infrahilar airspace opacification is stable. Focal pleural thickening with left apical pleural calcification is unchanged. 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  The left Pleurx drain has been removed,no pneumothorax. 
2.  Persistent bibasilar and infrahilar opacities and left pleural effusion are remain stable.",0

THREE VIEWS OF THE RIGHT SHOULDER:  The comminuted right scapular fracture is again demonstrated.  There is no significant change in the alignment of the fracture fragments compared to the prior study.  The glenohumeral and the acromioclavicular joints appear to be intact.  The AC joint has an unusual appearance on the AP view likely secondary to artifact.  No new fractures are identified. 
IMPRESSION:  Healing right scapular fracture with no significant change in the alignment of the fracture fragments.  No evidence of new acute fracture or dislocation.",0
"EXAM:  MRI LUMBAR SPINE. 
CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient with bilateral groin pain along with back pain. 
TECHNIQUE:  T1 and T2 sagittal and T2 axial images of lumbar spine obtained.

PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH. 
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, [**2149-2-2**]. 
FINDINGS:  A nasogastric tube courses through the esophagus into the stomach. There remains a large hiatal hernia, which is no longer gas-filled.  Lung volumes are lower than on the previous examination.  There is suggestion of a new opacity in the right upper lung.  Aeration at the right base; however, appears somewhat better compared to the earlier examination.  Prominence of the pulmonary vasculature may be somewhat due to edema, but also reflective of low lung volumes.  Heart size appears stable allowing for lower lung volumes. There is no pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**11-17**], 1:18 a.m.: 
Although ET tube is in standard position, left lung is almost entirely collapsed.  The absence of rightward mediastinal shift suggests that the volume of atelectasis exceeds the increase if any in left pleural effusion. Right lung is grossly clear.  Cardiac silhouette partially obscured. Distension of the right lower paratracheal soft tissue is due largely to adenopathy.  Nasogastric tube passes as far as the gastroesophageal junction, beyond which the tip is obscured.  No pneumothorax.  Left subclavian line tip projects over the SVC.",0

COMPARISON:  None.  
CLINICAL HISTORY:  61-year-old woman with failure to thrive. There are no prior chest radiographs available for comparison. The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of failure to thrive. 

The heart is normal in size and there is no evidence of cardiomegaly. The mediastinum is within normal limits. Both lungs show mild perihilar haze, which may be indicative of congestion or fluid buildup. However, given the clinical history of failure to thrive, other causes such as infection or inflammation cannot be excluded and further clinical correlation is required.

No pneumothorax is seen, but there is a small left pleural effusion present. This indicates the presence of fluid in the space around the lungs. Additionally, bibasilar atelectasis or infiltrate is observed in the lungs. Atelectasis refers to the collapse or partial collapse of lung tissue, while infiltrate refers to an abnormal collection of cells or substances in the lung tissue. These findings are concerning and require further clinical evaluation to determine the underlying cause.
