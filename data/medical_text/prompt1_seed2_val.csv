"Analysis of alterations in the retinoblastoma gene and tumor grade in bone and soft-tissue sarcomas. We examined 43 sporadic bone and soft-tissue sarcomas for molecular genetic alterations affecting the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene Rb-1 (also known as RB1). The gene was altered in 6 of 14 sporadic osteosarcomas and in 5 of 29 other bone and soft-tissue sarcomas. Rb-1 messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts were detected in normal tissues and benign lipomas, but they were absent or altered in each of the 19 sarcomas we examined. To examine the association of deletions in the Rb-1 gene with tumor grade, we correlated the DNA alterations in the Rb-1 gene with clinical data for 36 patients. The Rb-1 gene was altered in 40% of high-grade bone and soft-tissue tumors, but not in low-grade bone tumors and in only one low-grade, soft-tissue sarcoma. Overall, 10 of 25 high-grade sarcomas had detectable alterations of the Rb-1 gene compared with only 1 of 11 low-grade tumors. ",0
"Bilateral sudden deafness and acute acquired toxoplasmosis. An 18-year-old woman, while suffering from acute acquired toxoplasmosis, experienced sudden deafness and a total loss of vestibular function first in the right ear and three months later also in the left. Following treatment with sulphadiazine and pyrimethamine, hearing was retrieved to such a degree that the patient was enabled to communicate by means of a body-worn hearing aid and lip-reading. Taking the differential diagnostic possibilities into account, we believe that toxoplasmosis was the cause of the severe hearing loss. Since effective treatment seems to be available, we recommend that patients with acute bilateral sensorineural hearing loss of unknown origin are examined for acute toxoplasmosis with a view to instituting chemotherapy.

"Mesial temporal sclerosis: pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management. Mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) is probably the most common symptomatic pathologic entity--alone or mixed with other pathologic features--for seizures of temporal lobe origin. The pathophysiology of MTS, including any genetic influence, needs clarification. A characteristic ictal expression for seizures of MTS origin appears not to exist. The majority of patients (78%) with postresection MTS who are seizure-free have tightly localized interictal abnormalities restricted to F7/F8, Sp1/Sp2, T3/T4, and T5/T6 more than 96% of the time. MRI abnormalities may be seen in 55% of patients with MTS if both ""hard"" and ""soft"" criteria are used or in 20% when only ""hard"" criteria are used. The neuropsychologic evaluation of patients with MTS, which includes intracarotid amobarbital test (IAT), may prove to be increasingly useful in identifying patterns of cognitive deficit that correlate with enhancement of both lateralizing and localizing preoperative information.

"Ischaemic heart disease among men in Norway during the period 1966-1985: two counties with different mortality time trends. We have examined regional differences in mortality from ischaemic heart disease, including sudden, unexpected death (IHD/SUD), among Norwegian men aged 30-69 years, during the period 1966-1985. Mortality time trends were considered. The two counties with the most widely differing IHD/SUD mortality time trends were Rogaland and Oppland. Rogaland, located in south-western Norway, experienced a 24.1% IHD/SUD mortality rate decrease between 1966-1970 and 1981-1985, while Oppland, in central south-eastern Norway, experienced a mortality rate increase of 12.4%. Marked regional differences within these counties were found. The highest IHD/SUD mortality rate increase occurred in rural areas of Oppland. Urban areas of Rogaland had sharply decreasing rates. Knowledge of such regional mortality differences could provide useful information regarding aetiological factors and serve as a basis for preventive measures and health-care planning. ",0
"Small cell carcinoma of the pancreas and biliary tract. Four cases of anaplastic carcinoma of the pancreas or biliary tract were studied clinicopathologically and immunohistochemically. All four cases were intermediate cell type and contained a minimum amount of microscopic foci of differentiated glandular adenocarcinoma. Argyrophilic tumor cells were not seen in any of the four tumors. Immunohistochemically, no tumor was positive for hormonal products, but all tumors were positive for epithelial markers. These findings suggest that the anaplastic carcinoma are not derived from argyrophilic cells, but rather from adenocarcinomas which have the potential for anaplastic metaplasia. The long-term survival of one patient emphasized the importance of chemotherapy in the treatment of small cell carcinoma of the pancreas and biliary tract. ",0
"Central odontogenic fibroma: clinicopathologic features of 19 cases and review of the literature. The odontogenic fibroma is a benign neoplasm infrequently reported in the literature (20 cases). Nineteen additional examples are reported. This lesion occurs most frequently in the maxilla anterior to the molars and displays a striking female predilection. On occasion, it may be associated with an unerupted mandibular third molar. Histomorphologically, it is not encapsulated. A spectrum of fibrous connective tissue stroma is present: from myxoid to densely hyalinized and from relatively acellular to cellular. Calcification may or may not be present. It is distinguished by the presence of sparse cords and islands of inactive odontogenic epithelium. Enucleation or surgical curettage is appropriate therapy and recurrence is low. As there appears to be no correlation of histologic pattern with clinical behavior, it seems unnecessary to try to separate the tumor into two variants. ",0
"Prevention of renal disease and conservation of renal function. In summary, we have reviewed some of the most frequently encountered areas of prevention of renal failure in the elderly. They include obstruction, hypertension, drug interaction, and inappropriate use of drugs and the silent killer of the elderly, renal carcinoma. Only by a thorough understanding of the altered physiology of the aging kidney can the physician avoid making the same mistakes when new drugs are developed or new types of diseases are encountered. Proper early diagnosis and understanding the guidelines to therapy in these conditions, can save huge human costs in terms of mortality, morbidity, and money. ",0
"Testicular calcifications and neoplasia in patient treated for subfertility. A subfertile male with a history of left cryptorchism underwent scrotal ultrasound that revealed stippled calcifications, without associated mass, in the right testicle. Six months later, while on a regimen of clomiphene citrate, a testicular tumor became palpable. This was sonographically confirmed to be surrounding the calcifications. Testicular calcifications are most commonly associated with benign conditions. We review the literature regarding their relationship to neoplasms and the significance of the ultrasonic findings. Furthermore, this is the sixth reported case of testicular tumor developing during hormonal treatment for oligospermia. Although these cases may be circumstantial, closer surveillance and screening ultrasound may be indicated for subfertile males taking clomiphene citrate. ",0
"Inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms. In a series of 517 operations for abdominal aortic aneurysm from 1971 to 1988 there were 45 cases (8.7%) with an inflammatory aneurysm with a typical thick glistening whitish fibrous layer. Almost two-third of the patients had rather severe chronic or acute progressive pain in the abdomen, the back or the flank. Unilateral (7) or bilateral (2) hydronephrosis due to ureteral compression occurred in 9 patients (20%). A diagnosis of inflammatory aneurysm was made preoperatively only in 10 patients. In 8 of the 9 patients with hydronephrosis ureterolysis was done, unilaterally (6) or bilaterally (2). After ureterolysis all had complete resolution of the hydronephrosis. Preoperative diagnostic methods are excretory urography, showing medial deviation, ultrasonography and CT-scanning of the abdominal aorta. All patients with an inflammatory aneurysm should undergo aortic replacement to prevent rupture and achieve pain relief. Ureterolysis in cases of hydronephrosis is strongly recommended and may be performed safely and with excellent results. ",0
"Lugol stain for intraoperative determination of the proximal surgical margin of the esophagus. An adequate proximal surgical margin is difficult to determine particularly in cases of esophageal carcinoma with surrounding intraepithelial invasion. We report here readily facilitated intraoperative approaches for detection of the exact margin of carcinomatous invasion of the esophagus. The resected specimen of the esophagus is incised longitudinally and placed in a 1% Lugol bath for 2-3 minutes. The normal squamous epithelium includes glycogen that interacts with the iodine of Lugol's solution and the normal epithelium of the esophagus becomes a uniform greenish-brown. A squamous cell carcinoma does not include glycogen, hence is not stained with this solution and a clear identification is feasible. Thus, a carcinomatous infiltration not recognizable in routine examinations becomes macroscopically visible when Lugol's solution is used. ",0
"Clinical judgments in pain management. From research reports published over the last 20 years, it appears that moderate to severe uncontrolled pain may be the norm for hospitalized patients despite recent advances in the management of pain. Research on the extent of under-management of pain and the factors associated with it is examined and summarized in this paper. Methodological imperfections of the research are identified. Several explanations for pain under-management have been proposed and these are reported. A clinical decision making model is also reviewed and it is suggested that this model could be applied to pain management problems. Further, it is suggested that this model may be very useful in developing educational interventions to improve health practitioners' clinical skills in pain management. ",0
"Germfree animals and technics in surgical research. Germfree animals have been reared to a size, weight, and age permitting the performance of major surgical procedures and the pursuit of a variety of surgical research problems. Germfree dogs have been maintained in the isolator system through three generations, indicating that life, reproduction, and growth are all possible in the absence of microbial contamination. The value of the germfree approach to surgical problems has been utilized in studies of a variety of gastrointestinal problems, shock, cancer, immunology, burns, wound healing, and in direct patient application. Patients have been maintained in isolator environments for prevention of infection, for operative procedures, for treatment of extensive burns, and for management of immune-suppressed individuals. We conclude that germfree animals and germfree technics provide a valuable addition to the armamentarium of the surgeon in both research and clinical applications. ",0
"Adverse treatment effects in the trial of the European Working Party on High Blood Pressure in the Elderly. Adverse treatment effects were assessed in 840 elderly hypertensive patients randomly assigned to active treatment (a combination of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide) or placebo; methyldopa was added to the regimen in one third of the treated patients. Symptoms of dry mouth, nasal stuffiness, and diarrhea were reported by significantly more treated patients than placebo control subjects. More patients receiving diuretics plus methyldopa than diuretics alone reported dry mouth and diarrhea. Significantly more treated patients than control subjects showed evidence of a high serum creatinine level, mild hypokalemia, and gout. More treated patients tended to have diabetes. The benefits of treatment outweighed these adverse treatment effects. ",0
"Corpus callosotomy for intractable seizures in the pediatric age group. The results of corpus callosotomy in 18 patients 16 years old and younger are presented. Eighty-three percent of our patients have had a significant improvement from the surgery (a decrease in seizure frequency of greater than 80% or no longer having generalized atonic, tonic, or tonic-clonic seizures). The procedure seems to be well tolerated in young patients, and we have not noted a postoperative deterioration in behavior, memory, or language function in our patients. One of our patients died in status epilepticus 3 months after surgery. Nevertheless, we have not encountered any serious morbidity in our other patients. Corpus callosotomy can be considered for children with intractable seizures, especially when generalized atonic, tonic, or tonic-clonic (whether primary or secondary) seizures are the major seizure type.

"Modified technique of Pringle's maneuver in resection of the liver. Crushing of the hepatic parenchyma with hepatic clamps to minimize blood loss during resection of the liver leads to mechanical damage of hepatocytes. Pringle's maneuver may precipitate liver failure by hepatic warm ischemia as well. Therefore, we controlled bleeding from the surface of the resection by using light compression on the hepatic parenchyma with a band while applying a hepatic arterial clamp at the hepatic hilus. This vascular control method can be done because the portal pressure is about one-tenth of the hepatic artery pressure and provides an efficient and harmless transection of the liver. ",0
"Prognostic factors in primary retroperitoneal soft-tissue sarcomas. We analyzed independent treatment variables (age, sex, signs and symptoms, site, size, histopathologic findings, grade, and clinical presentation) and treatment-dependent variables (resectability, type of operation, surgical margins, surgical boundaries, microscopic margins, adjuvant radiotherapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy) in 80 patients with primary retroperitoneal soft-tissue sarcomas admitted from 1982 through 1988. Both univariate and multivariate analysis of survival and disease-free survival were performed. The major factor in survival outcome was the ability to completely resect the lesion. When the 62 patients who underwent complete resection were examined, the only independent prognostic factor for both survival and disease-free survival was grade. We conclude that completeness of resection and grade of the lesion are primary determinants of survival. Once all tumor is macroscopically removed, no advantage could be demonstrated by more extensive surgical resection or current adjuvant therapy. ",0
"Surgery for thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. From July 1985 to July 1989, Loma Linda University Medical Center evaluated 46 thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs). Forty patients were taken to surgery--18 (45%) were operated on an emergency basis for reasons including rupture (12 patients, 30%), dissection (5 patients, 12.5%), and severe pain (1 patient). The overall mortality for all operated patients was five (12.5%-17% for emergency surgery versus 9% for elective surgery). Nonfatal complications occurred in 40 per cent of patients (16). The overall incidence of paraplegia was 10 per cent (4/40), emergency patients 17 per cent (3/18) versus elective patients 4.5 per cent (1/22). Careful preoperative evaluation, standardization of operative technique, and good postoperative management have improved the outlook for these patients who otherwise would progress to eventual rupture and death. Because mortality and morbidity are substantially reduced in elective patients, we recommend that all patients with TAAAs be evaluated for surgery as soon as diagnosis is made. ",0
"Intracatheter streptokinase for recurrent peritonitis in CAPD. Intracatheter streptokinase (SK) is advocated as effective treatment with minimal adverse effects in both recurrent bacterial peritonitis and catheter fibrin blockage in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. We reviewed 35 instillations in 20 patients noting a high (86%) side effect profile consisting of fever, onset of turbid dialysis effluent and/or abdominal pain. SK probably releases fibrin clot containing bacteria, leukocytes and debris from the colonized catheter into the peritoneal cavity causing a ""peritonitis-like syndrome"" of 1 to 3 days duration. Fungal peritonitis occurred after SK in 2 patients. Failure of SK therapy was encountered in Staphylococcus epidermidis infection (p less than 0.05 versus other organisms), which may be related to its protective capsular polysaccharide slime and ability to adhere to plastic prosthetic devices. SK, in this study, was useful treatment in relapsing bacterial peritonitis (50% overall cure) but failed to correct catheter malfunction. ",0
"The value of indium 111 leukocyte scanning in the evaluation of painful or infected total knee arthroplasties. Evaluation of painful total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) for infection can be difficult. Indium 111 (111In) leukocyte bone scanning provides a minimally invasive technique for evaluation of possible infection. Thirty-eight patients with a painful TKA who had surgical exploration after 111In leukocyte scanning were reviewed. The scan had an accuracy of 84%, a sensitivity of 83%, and a specificity of 85%. The 111In leukocyte scans must be interpreted in conjunction with the clinical evaluation of the patient because they are less accurate for study of TKAs than of total hip arthroplasties. ",0
"Ultrasound and ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy of supraclavicular lymph nodes in patients with esophageal carcinoma. The use of ultrasound combined with ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (UGFAB) of supraclavicular lymph nodes in the pretreatment staging of 37 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus is described. All patients underwent computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest and the abdomen and ultrasound of the abdomen and supraclavicular regions. Supraclavicular lymph node metastases (Stage IV disease according to the tumor nodes metastasis [TNM] classification) were cytologically diagnosed in seven (18.9%) of the 37 patients. In two of these patients, no other metastases were found. In the other five patients, UGFAB replaced more invasive diagnostic procedures. Due to their superficial location, ultrasound and UGFAB of the supraclavicular lymph nodes was relatively simple to perform, and contributed to an improved staging of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus.

"A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of oral antibiotic therapy following intravenous antibiotic therapy for postpartum endometritis. One hundred thirty-six patients were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of oral antibiotic therapy (amoxicillin) versus placebo following successful intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy for postpartum endometritis. No subjects were readmitted to the hospital for recurrent endometritis and there were no wound infections or recurrent fevers. Minor side effects were seen in 10% of those taking amoxicillin and 14% of those taking placebo. Compliance was fair; only 52% of those taking amoxicillin and 65% of those taking placebo completed therapy. The lack of infectious complications in this high-risk population suggests that oral antibiotic therapy is unnecessary after successful IV antibiotic therapy for endometritis. ",0
"Slowly progressive aphasia: three cases with language, memory, CT and PET data. Three cases of slowly progressive speech and language disturbance were studied at various points post onset (three, five and 15 years respectively). Language, neuropsychological and brain imaging (computer tomography and positron emission tomography) evaluations were completed on all three patients. The data suggest that the syndrome of ""progressive aphasia"": 1) does not involve a uniform symptom complex; 2) does not necessarily develop into a full blown dementia syndrome; 3) varies greatly in rate of progression from case to case; 4) is associated with normal brain structure (on computer tomography); and 5) is associated with abnormal left temporal lobe metabolism as measured by fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET). One patient had histological findings consistent with Alzheimer's disease at necropsy. ",0
"Visual evoked potential monitoring of optic nerve function during surgery. A study was made with intra-operative flash--visual evoked potentials (VEP) monitored using a fibre-optic/contact lens photo stimulator in 57 patients undergoing intra-orbital surgical procedures with potential risk to the optic nerve. The VEPs recorded under enflurane and nitrous oxide anaesthesia did not differ significantly in latency or amplitude from the pre-operative recordings. Transient abolition of the VEP was seen under many circumstances and did not correlate with the outcome of surgery, but absence of a previously normal VEP for more than four minutes during surgical manipulation within the orbit did show a correlation with post operative impairment of vision. The technique provides early warning to the surgeon of threats to the integrity of the optic nerve. ",0
"Protein phosphorylation during ischemia. Many investigations have shown that calcium and adenosine triphosphate are crucial to central nervous system functions. It is probable that alterations of these substances during central nervous system ischemia are involved in the processes that cause irreversible neural damage. Calcium regulates several protein kinases that are responsible for phosphorylation of proteins vital for many central nervous system functions. Using a rabbit spinal cord ischemia model, we found protein kinase C and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase were severely affected during the first hour of ischemia. Protein kinase A was not significantly affected. The time course of lost protein kinase C enzyme activity closely corresponded to irreversible loss of neurologic function, and there is evidence that protein kinase C inhibitor activity is generated. Also, drugs that inhibit protein kinase C increased neurologic damage when administered during the early phases of ischemia. These results suggest that protein phosphorylation, particularly by protein kinase C, is critical to maintenance of neurologic function. ",0
"Surgical therapy of the eyelids in patients with facial paralysis. Patients with facial paralysis have a degree of lagophthalmos and paralytic ectropion. We present our experience in the surgical management of 25 consecutive patients treated for these problems. Paralytic lagophthalmos was corrected using gold weights inserted into the upper eyelid. The advantages and disadvantages of this surgical technique are reviewed. Medial canthoplasty and lateral canthoplasty were performed to rectify paralytic ectropion. Ancillary procedures included browpexy, upper-lid blepharoplasty, and temporalis sling. The results were excellent in 23 of 25 patients and good in the remaining two. After a minimum of 6 months' follow-up, there were no complications. The authors believe that the above procedures will yield consistently excellent cosmetic and functional results in patients with paralysis of the eyelids. ",0
"Clinical outcome of emergency repeat coronary artery bypass surgery. To determine the clinical outcome of patients requiring emergency repeat coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedures, we reviewed 23 such procedures performed for ongoing myocardial ischemia refractory to medical management. The operative mortality was 17%. On follow-up, an average of 24.9 months after emergency reoperation, 14 of the 19 survivors (74%) had recurrent angina. As compared to a randomly selected group of 25 patients who underwent elective repeat CABG procedures during the same time period, the incidence of late cardiac events was significantly higher (79% in the emergency group, 30% in the elective surgery group) and fewer patients had received internal mammary artery (IMA) grafts (9% vs 52%). Emergency repeat CABG operations have considerable operative mortality and poor postoperative functional results with the majority of survivors developing recurrent ischemic syndromes within a short period of time.

"Clinical results of axillobifemoral bypass using externally supported polytetrafluoroethylene Seventy-six axillobifemoral grafts with externally supported polytetrafluoroethylene prostheses were performed since 1983. The indications for operation were absolute (aortic sepsis) in 20 (26%) patients and relative (excessive operative risk or technical difficulty) in 56 (74%) patients. The life-table primary patency for these operations at 4 years follow-up (mean follow-up, 2 years, 4 months) was 85%. We conclude that the patency results achieved in this patient series are sufficiently satisfactory to warrant use of axillobifemoral grafts in an expanded number of patients with high operative risk and need for bypass of aortoiliac occlusive disease.

"Asymptomatic rhabdomyolysis of unknown etiology. A 7-year-old boy developed rhabdomyolysis with a peak creatine phosphokinase level of 261,400 IU/L after his appendectomy. These abnormalities occurred following a 2-3-day illness consisting of upper respiratory tract symptoms, fever, and abdominal pain mimicking acute appendicitis. At the time of operation, a normal appendix was removed, and mesenteric lymphadenitis was noted. The myoglobinuria and elevation of creatine phosphokinase were transient, and the patient remained asymptomatic. We review various causes of right lower quadrant pain and rhabdomyolysis and address the roles of malignant hyperthermia and infectious agents. The possible cause of the phenomena observed in this patient is discussed. ",0
"The cellular biology of bone tumors. New knowledge in cell and molecular biology has begun to expand the understanding of the biology of osteosarcoma and Ewing's sarcoma. Studies on osteosarcomas have revealed abnormalities in the growth-inhibiting retinoblastoma gene, which may release cells from normal growth control. Abnormalities in growth factor production or response tend to inappropriately activate cell growth. Tumor cell DNA content and cytogenetics may affect the diagnosis and prognostic grouping of osteosarcomas. In Ewing's sarcomas, a characteristic translocation between Chromosomes 11 and 22 has been identified; this translocation is also found in malignant neuroepitheliomas. A variety of studies point to both neuroectodermal and mesenchymal origins for Ewing's sarcomas. Applications of new biologic knowledge and technology to clinical problems will lead to significant changes in the diagnosis, and perhaps in the treatment, of these tumors in the coming years. Collaborations between community and referral center physicians and scientists are critical for continued progress. ",0
"Selective peripheral denervation for torticollis: preliminary results Herein we report the preliminary results in nine patients who have undergone selective peripheral denervation for spasmodic torticollis and have been followed up for at least 13 months. All patients had improvement immediately after surgical intervention, and the results have been maintained in five patients. In one patient who had recurrent torticollis, a second procedure in conjunction with injection of botulinum toxin has produced substantial improvement; however, follow-up was brief (6 months). No surgical complications occurred. We believe that selective peripheral denervation is safe and that it can benefit patients with torticollis who have not responded to other types of therapy. These favorable results confirm other published reports on the efficacy of selective peripheral denervation. Long-term follow-up, however, is necessary for determining the role of this procedure in the management of torticollis. ",0
"Postoperative hypertension: a prospective, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind trial, with intravenous nicardipine hydrochloride. Nicardipine hydrochloride, a new calcium channel blocker for intravenous use, has been compared with placebo in a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial on postoperative hypertension. Of 175 patients who signed preoperative consent, 24 (13.7%) met entry criteria. Hypertension was significantly better controlled in nicardipine-treated patients compared with those receiving placebo (93% versus 30%, p less than 0.05). All the placebo failures were subsequently successfully treated with nicardipine. There were no significant complications in either group. The authors conclude that nicardipine HC1 is an effective, safe therapy for postoperative hypertension. Further studies are now indicated comparing it with other drugs currently used to treat this condition. ",0
"Stroke recurrence within 2 years after ischemic infarction. We prospectively studied stroke recurrence in 1,273 patients with ischemic stroke who were entered into the Stroke Data Bank. Median follow-up was 13 months. The 2-year cumulative recurrence rate among these patients was 14.1%. Age, sex, race, history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, or transient ischemic attacks, and stroke location were not associated with a higher risk of stroke recurrence. Patients with an elevated blood pressure, an abnormal initial computed tomogram, or a history of diabetes mellitus were at a higher risk of stroke recurrence. In contrast, patients with an infarct of unknown cause were at a lower risk of stroke recurrence than patients with a defined stroke mechanism, such as lacune, embolism, or atherosclerosis. A multivariate model suggests that patients at the lowest risk for stroke recurrence have a low diastolic blood pressure, no history of stroke, no history of diabetes mellitus, and an infarct of unknown cause.

"Reconstruction of mandibular defects in irradiated patients. In this prospective study, mandibular reconstruction using titanium plates was evaluated in 31 patients treated between July 1988 and January 1990. Sixteen patients had prior surgery; 13 had prior radiotherapy. In 11 patients, prior radiation and surgery had failed. Sixteen patients received postoperative radiotherapy either in standard or accelerated fractions. Twelve patients had complications of either intraoral (8), extraoral (5), or combined (1) plate exposure or fistula formation (2). Factors significantly related to complications were poor nutrition, accelerated radiation, and recurrence. Sixty-one percent of all patients healed uneventfully. When patients with complications secondary to recurrence who subsequently died were excluded, the success rate was 73%. Only one patient had an unacceptable result that produced a cosmetic and functional deformity despite secondary repair. ",0
"Angina, ischemia, and effort tolerance with vasodilating beta-blockers. beta-Blockers are known to suppress exercise-induced ischemia but give rise to such problems as fatigue or dyspnea on effort and also bradycardia. In a series of double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of celiprolol (a cardioselective beta 1-blocker with beta 2-agonist and vasodilatory properties) in patients with hypertension and angina and in normal volunteers, it was found that celiprolol did not produce bradycardia when given in combination with verapamil. Celiprolol did reduce exercise-induced ischemia, but there was no reduction in cardiac output at rest or on exercise compared with placebo. Compared with atenolol, celiprolol produced less dyspnea and fatigue at submaximal levels of exercise. It is concluded that celiprolol possesses certain differences, compared with conventional beta-blockers, that may be of direct clinical benefit. ",0
"Strokes in African-Americans. Hypertension is the most important risk factor for stroke, especially in African-Americans. Improved control of high blood pressure nationwide is a key factor in the recent dramatic decline in stroke frequency, most notably in African-American women. Hypertension control programs must be adequately funded and expanded. African-Americans have a disproportionately high incidence of risk factors for stroke, including hypertension. There is evidence that the cerebral vessels involved in ischemic stroke in African-Americans may differ from those of Caucasians. There is an urgent need for more research on stroke in general, risk factor relations in particular, and mechanisms in the pathogenesis of stroke in African-Americans. ",0
"Does age affect outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation? We examined the relation between age and outcomes in patients treated for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Seattle, Wash. Considering all out-of-hospital cardiac arrests treated by paramedics over a recent 5-year period, 386 (27%) of 1405 consecutive patients aged 70 years or older were resuscitated and admitted to a hospital vs 474 (29%) of 1624 younger patients; 140 elderly patients (10%) were discharged alive vs 223 younger patients (14%). Of the 140 elderly patients, 112 went home and 28 went to a nursing home. Considering only patients whose initial rhythms were ventricular fibrillation, the percent of patients discharged alive was substantially higher: 120 (24%) of 493 for elderly patients and 194 (30%) of 639 for younger patients. Elderly patients can benefit from attempted resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. ",0
"Surgical treatment of aneurysm or dissection involving the ascending aorta and aortic arch, utilizing circulatory arrest and retrograde cerebral perfusion. Recently we replaced the ascending aorta and aortic arch in 8 patients with aneurysm or dissection, using profound hypothermic circulatory arrest with retrograde cerebral perfusion. There were no operative deaths. Open aortic anastomosis facilitated repair of the aortic arch without clamping the arch tributaries, and embolism due to particulate debris from clamping of the arch vessels was eliminated. Retrograde cerebral perfusion during profound hypothermic circulatory arrest is a simplified technique that may protect the brain. This method offers advantages over previously described methods, particularly in obviating dissection of the arch tributaries and the clamping thereof, and in protecting the central nervous system.

"Matched group study of surgical resection versus cobalt-60 plaque radiotherapy for primary choroidal or ciliary body melanoma. We report the results of a nonrandomized, matched-group, survival and visual preservation study of patients with a choroidal or ciliary body melanoma managed by microsurgical resection of the tumor versus cobalt-60 episcleral plaque radiotherapy. Each treatment group consisted of 30 patients. All patients were matched on a case-by-case basis in terms of tumor size (largest linear tumor dimension), location of the anterior tumor margin relative to the ora serrata, location of the posterior tumor margin relative to the equator, and age at the time of treatment. Although the estimated actuarial 5-year survival probability was slightly greater in the resection group (85.2%) than in the cobalt plaque group (81.8%), this difference was neither clinically impressive nor statistically significant. In contrast, there was a substantially higher rate of early posttreatment severe visual loss in the resection group (P = .0008, Mantel-Haenszel test). ",0
"Primary lymphoma of the central nervous system in two children with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Postmortem examination disclosed central nervous system non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in two children who died of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) at 6 and 14 months of age, respectively. Systemic signs of lymphoma were not present. The B-cell origin and clonality of the neoplastic cells were established by immunohistochemistry in one case and by molecular analysis of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement in the other. Moreover, in the latter case the neoplastic cells were characterized by the presence of a single episomal EBV genome. According to these data, the monoclonal B-cell proliferation occurred after EBV infection, thus suggesting a possible pathogenetic role of EBV in the early stages of lymphomagenesis. ",0
"Wrist flexion as an adjunct to the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome. The effects of five minutes of wrist flexion on median motor and sensory evoked potential latencies in 87 individuals were studied. Nineteen subjects had carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) as diagnosed by increased median nerve latencies across the wrist, and 68 had values in the normal range and were assigned to the control group. A slight prolongation of up to 0.5m sec of evoked potential latencies was observed in both groups after flexion, but the differences between the two groups were not significant to establish the value of adding wrist flexion to conventional screening methods.

"Critical review of gangliosides and thyrotropin-releasing hormone in peripheral neuromuscular diseases. The lack of effective therapy for many of the chronic neuromuscular diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, hereditary motor sensory neuropathy (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease), spinocerebellar degenerations and idiopathic polyneuropathy has led to a search for substances that may stimulate peripheral nerve regeneration. Two such agents that have been proposed are gangliosides (mixed purified bovine brain gangliosides, Cronassial) and thyrotropin releasing factor (TRH). Studies on both of these agents were initially reported with enthusiasm to be successful, but later double-blind controlled studies have failed to confirm these findings. This review provides critical analysis of the designs of studies of potentially effective agents in chronic neuromuscular diseases, and emphasizes the power of the placebo response, and the importance of designing placebos which are indistinguishable from the trial medication other than in the active effect.

"Primary defect in alpha-adrenergic responsiveness in patients with varicose veins. Responsiveness of superficial hand veins to local infusions of noradrenaline was compared in patients with primary varicose veins and in healthy volunteers by use of the dorsal hand vein technique. Patients with varicose veins required significantly higher doses of noradrenaline for half-maximal venoconstriction than the dose required by control subjects (geometric mean, 11.6 ng/min in patients compared with 4.8 ng/min in control subjects; p = 0.006). Noradrenaline responsiveness in varicose veins was not significantly different from hand vein responsiveness in the same patients. Our findings indicate a constitutional decrease in venous alpha-adrenergic receptor responsiveness in patients with varicosities. Dilation of varicose veins does not further affect noradrenaline-induced venoconstriction. ",0
"Immunohistochemical demonstration of pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor in normal and neoplastic colonic mucosa. Specimens of normal and neoplastic colonic mucosa from 52 patients were analysed by immunohistochemistry using a monospecific polyclonal antiserum against human pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (PSTI). In normal colonic mucosa PSTI was found in the goblet cells in the basal parts of the crypts. In adenomas of tubular, villous, and tubulo-villous types PSTI was also found in the upper parts of the polyps, usually occurring in the regeneration zone. There was a more intense staining reaction in polyps with increased atypia. Carcinomas of different types and of various grades of differentiation and of in situ type did not contain PSTI. These findings indicate that PSTI could be a marker for adenomatous rather than carcinomatous epithelium in the colon. Furthermore, the absence of the inhibitor in malignant cells might facilitate tissue invasion by malignant cells because of deficient protease inhibition. ",0
"Skeletal muscle depressed calcium and phosphofructokinase in chronic heart failure are upregulated by captopril--a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, after treatment for 5-6 weeks with 25 mg t.i.d., were studied in 12 patients with stable moderate heart failure. Five patients received placebo treatment, and the two groups were comparable at baseline. Angiotensin II levels decreased in response to captopril therapy. Skeletal muscle potassium, magnesium and chloride levels did not differ from reference values. Calcium was subnormal (P less than 0.0001), but increased to the reference range during captopril treatment. Phosphofructokinase, a rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme, was in the lower reference range and increased (P less than 0.04) in response to captopril therapy. In conclusion, stable moderate heart failure is associated with low levels of skeletal muscle calcium and phosphofructokinase activity, these metabolic changes tending to return to normal levels with captopril treatment.

"Hemodynamic and endocrine effects of mental stress in untreated borderline hypertension. Mental arithmetic and mirror tracing were compared in 40 untreated patients with borderline hypertension, tested in random sequence in standardized protocols. Both tasks significantly increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac index, plasma renin, and decreased peripheral resistance. Mental arithmetic also increased cholesterol, triglycerides and HDL; plasma catecholamines were not changed significantly. Lipid changes were correlated with blood pressure changes. These methods will be useful in exploring the relationships between hemodynamic reactivity to stress, and the presence and progression of atherosclerosis, as well as testing the effects of antihypertensive drugs on stress-induced changes that may influence atherosclerotic complications of hypertension.

"Recombination between two 14-bp homologous sequences as the mechanism for gene deletion in factor IX Seattle 1. Factor IXSeattle 1 is a 10-kb intragenic deletion identified in a family that has hemophilia B. By sequencing across the site of the deletion, we discovered at the deletion junction a 13-bp sequence (5' . . . TAGAA-GTTCACTT . . . 3') that was homologous to two 14-bp sequences 10 kb apart in introns D and F of the normal factor IX gene. The presence of these homologous sequences in two different regions of the normal gene allows us to propose that genetic recombination has occurred between the sequences, resulting in the gene deletion. The precise recombination site was able to be localized to one of 5 bp (5' . . . AGTTC . . . 3') in the middle of the homologous sequences. The exact length of the deletion is 10,000 bp. ",0
"Pleuropulmonary manifestations of hepatic amebiasis Pleuropulmonary manifestations of hepatic amebiasis occurred in 30 patients; 18 (60%) presented with at least 1 pulmonary complaint and 10 (33%) had multiple pulmonary symptoms. In 14 patients (47%), abnormalities were found on examination of the chest. In 16 chest roentgenograms (53%), there was at least 1 abnormality: right-sided pleural effusion (9 patients) and elevated right hemidiaphragm (8 patients) were the most common. All patients were treated with metronidazole (Flagyl) and had resolution of the amebic liver abscess and pulmonary disease. Pleuropulmonary disease is a common complication of amebic liver abscess. The clinical presentation and chest roentgenograms are virtually diagnostic and obviate the need for invasive procedures to confirm the diagnosis. Pleuropulmonary disease resolves with amebicidal treatment of the hepatic abscess. ",0
"The presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) in solitary adult laryngeal papillomas demonstrated by in-situ DNA hybridization with sulphonated probes. Human papilloma virus (HPV) types 6 and 11 have been repeatedly demonstrated in multiple laryngeal papillomas, and there is little doubt that these lesions are caused by HPV. It has been clearly demonstrated in recent reports that the clinical course of solitary adult onset laryngeal papillomas is entirely different from that of multiple papillomas of juvenile as well as of adult onset. We here report the presence of HPV types 6 and 11 in 19 out of 20 solitary papillomas from 16 patients, while HPV types 16 and 18 were totally absent. We conclude that the milder clinical course in such patients is most likely to be due to host factors, rather than to viral factors. ",0
"Serological evidence of infection with Helicobacter pylori may predict gastrointestinal intolerance to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) treatment in rheumatoid arthritis. Specific circulating antibodies to the spiral gastric organism, Helicobacter pylori (HP) were detectable in 43% of 68 patients with rheumatoid arthritis by complement fixation test (CFT) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), a frequency comparable with that of a normal, age-matched population. Presence of these antibodies correlated strongly with a previous history of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and to the severity of NSAID-related dyspeptic symptoms, the latter often leading to multiple drug intolerance. This contrasts with short term, prospective NSAID toxicity data, which show little relationship between ulceration and HP carriage. This result suggests, however, that HP may have a definite role in the pathogenesis of symptomatic PUD associated with more chronic NSAID usage, and may have important implications for ulcer prophylaxis in these patients.

"Polyamine levels in healthy and tumor tissues of patients with colon adenocarcinoma. Tissue polyamine levels were determined in patients with colon adenocarcinoma to try to identify biochemical indicators able to characterize the growth and the metabolism of human solid tumors. Polyamine content was determined in the tumor and in the ""healthy"" mucosa sampled at different distances within the resection edges. For each patient the polyamine content in the tumor was compared with that in the mucosa. The results demonstrated that the spermidine concentration was higher in the tumor than in the healthy mucosa; the differences were statistically significant. However, spermine in the tumor increased to a lesser degree. No statistically significant differences were observed among these mucosae at different localizations, but the spermine concentration in the mucosa after the tumor showed values very close to those of the neoplasia.

"HLA class I and class II antigen expression on squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. We compared human major histocompatibility (HLA) class I and class II antigen expression on squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with that on normal mucosa. Frozen sections of a consecutive series of 30 squamous cell carcinomas were stained with the monoclonal antibodies W6/32 (class I) and anti-DR (class II) using an immunoperoxidase technique. Normal mucosa showed class I and class II expression in the basal layers only. Class I expression on tumors was diffuse in 87%, patchy in 10%, and scattered in 3%. Class II expression on tumors was diffuse in 20%, patchy in 53%, scattered in 20%, and absent in 7%. Patterns of expression did not correlate significantly with clinical parameters, including survival, except that class II diffuse and patchy patterns were found to correlate with more poorly differentiated tumors.

"Denervation in hemiplegic muscles. This study examined the frequency of denervation activity in hemiplegic muscles in relation to the size and location of the central lesion. We studied 20 patients, 14 with major unilateral cerebral infarctions in the middle cerebral or internal carotid territories; four with a single lacune in the pons, internal capsule, or thalamus; and two with precentral infarcts. Using somatosensory evoked potentials, motor conduction studies, and assessments of conduction across the plexus and roots, we detected no conduction abnormalities on the affected side. Fibrillation was common in both groups, especially in distal and intermediate muscles. The distribution of the fibrillation and the normal conduction studies suggested that trauma of peripheral nerves was not a factor. Although the normal conduction studies and pattern of fibrillation activity do not exclude peripheral nerve trauma as the cause of the fibrillation, we suggest that transsynaptic degeneration is a reasonable alternative explanation.

"Systemic hypertension in sleep apnea syndrome. Relationship with sleep architecture and breathing abnormalities. To examine the possible relationship between systemic HT and SAS we compared 21 hypertensive (HT+) and 29 normotensive (HT-) patients for morphologic characteristics, sleep disturbances and respiratory events monitored during a full night polysomnography. There was no significant difference between HT+ and HT- patients with respect to age, weight, BMI, sleep stage distribution and disorganization, apnea-hypopnea index (number of episodes per hour of sleep) and duration (minutes per hour of sleep) nor O2 saturation indices: mean nocturnal and minimum O2 saturation. We conclude therefore that HT in SAS patients is not directly related to morphologic characteristics, sleep disturbances and breathing abnormalities. ",0
"Nucleolar organizer regions in precancerous and cancerous lesions of the bronchus. Using a silver staining technique, nucleolar organizer region-associated proteins (Ag-NOR) were studied in paraffin sections of five specimens of normal bronchial epithelium, eight of atypical squamous metaplasia, five of carcinoma in situ, and seven of microinvasive squamous cell carcinoma. The mean number of Ag-NOR in the nucleus were normal epithelium 1.2 +/- 0.1 (mean +/- SD), atypical squamous metaplasia (borderline lesion) 2.2 +/- 0.5, carcinoma in situ 3.8 +/- 0.6, and microinvasive squamous cell carcinoma 4.8 +/- 1.1. There was a highly significant difference between the Ag-NOR numbers in the atypical squamous metaplasia and those in the carcinoma in situ (P less than 0.01). The Ag-NOR staining is a useful technique for the differential diagnosis of difficult borderline lesions in the bronchial epithelium. ",0
"Development of language in six hemispherectomized patients. The development of language skills in the isolated right hemisphere was investigated by comparing the performance of 3 left hemispherectomized with that of the 3 right hemispherectomized patients and three groups of control subjects on baseline clinical measures of language and on production and judgement of morphological markers. The initial brain insult in the hemispherectomy patients of each group had occurred either during early, middle or late childhood. The left hemispherectomy patients were severely impaired in language processing across all three stages of language development. The consequences of a right hemisphere insult on language development were more restricted, with deleterious effects being apparent only in the case in which the lesion was acquired during early childhood.

"Prevalence of common and dysplastic naevi in a Swedish population. The naevus profile was examined in a Swedish population that was randomly selected from a census file. The participation rate was considered high at 82%. The number of common naevi (CN) and the prevalence of dysplastic naevi (DN) were investigated in 379 subjects (aged 30-50 years). The mean total body count of CN greater than or equal to 2 mm was 67 (range 1-300). As many as 22% of the population had 100 naevi or more and only 18% had less than 25. The counts were not influenced by age or sex. DN were diagnosed clinically in 18% (CI 14-22%) of the subjects and histologically in 8% (CI 5-11%). Subjects with dysplastic naevi had a significantly larger number of common naevi and a more sun-sensitive skin type than subjects without DN, P less than 0.001. ",0
"Effects of anticonvulsant treatment and low levels of folate and thiamine on amine metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid. A total of 157 epileptic patients were studied with respect to (1) biogenic amine precursors and metabolites in the CSF, (2) levels of folate and thiamine in the blood and CSF, (3) length of treatment with phenytoin (PHT), (4) PHT intoxication, (5) CNS atrophy. Alterations in CSF amine metabolite levels were related primarily to PHT intoxication, and low CSF folate and thiamine levels, but not to length of treatment or CNS atrophy. PHT intoxication increased CSF 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5HIAA). Low folate levels were associated with decreased CSF 5HIAA and homovanillic acid, while low thiamine levels were associated with decreased CSF 5HIAA and 3-methyoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethylene glycol. It remains to be seen to what extent these alterations in biogenic amine metabolism, mediated by low CNS vitamin levels, also lead to deficits in cerebral function. ",0
"Management of mycotic rupture of the ascending aorta after heart-lung transplantation. A 19-year-old woman underwent heart-lung transplantation for obstructive bronchiolitis. Eleven days later mycotic rupture of the ascending aorta occurred. Emergency cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted via the femoral vessels and the chest was reopened under cardiac massage. Perforation of the aorta at the site of insertion of the cardioplegic cannula in the donor aorta was seen. Under circulatory arrest the infected area was excised, a pericardial patch plasty was performed, and the region was covered with a muscle flap. Postoperatively, Candida albicans was found in the excised specimen of the aorta, in drainage fluid, and in the bronchoalveolar lavage. High doses of antimycotics were administered intravenously and for irrigation of the mediastinum, which resulted in an eradication of fungi in all cultures 7 days later. Six weeks after reoperation the patient was discharged home, and she remains well 9 months postoperatively. ",0
"Degenerative aortic stenosis. One effect of the graying of America. Degenerative calcific aortic stenosis is evolving as a common geriatric problem. Once symptoms develop, it is a highly lethal disease that does not respond well to medical therapy. Aortic balloon valvuloplasty may offer palliation but is unlikely to alter the overall course of the disease. Aortic valve replacement is the therapy of choice, but high perioperative morbidity and mortality rates can be expected in the very elderly. The presence of other appreciable cardiac disorders may contribute to the occurrence of postoperative complications. Patients with asymptomatic aortic stenosis and normal left ventricular function can be treated medically and followed with serial aortic valve area determinations using Doppler echocardiography. ",0
"Perianal appearances associated with constipation. The perianal appearances were studied prospectively of 136 constipated children (mean age 3.9 years, 67 boys, 69 girls). Anal dilatation, fissures, tags, warts, perianal oedema, redness, blueness, and veins were recorded. It was noted whether dilatation occurred immediately or at 30 and 60 seconds with the buttocks minimally separated, and on subsequent firm lateral traction of the buttocks. The degree of faecal loading was assessed in all children. Anal dilatation was found in 24 (18%) and first appeared on lateral traction in eight (6%). In three quarters of the children with dilatation faecal loading or perianal signs were present. Fissures were found in 35 (26%) children and tags in seven (5%). Perianal redness was more likely to be associated with fissures, and blueness with dilatation. We conclude that there are no pathognomonic perianal signs in childhood constipation and that the technique of anal examination should be standardised. ",0
"Delayed positive gastrointestinal bleeding studies with technetium-99m-red blood cells: utility of a second injection. Two patients studied with technetium-99m-labeled red blood cells (RBCs) for gastrointestinal bleeding had positive findings only on 24-hr delayed images, at which time the site of bleeding could not be ascertained. In each instance, when additional delayed images suggested that active bleeding was occurring, a second aliquot of RBCs was labeled and injected. Sites of active hemorrhage were identified following further imaging in both patients. When delayed GI bleeding images are positive, further views should be obtained to ascertain if the pattern of intraluminal activity changes. If renewed active hemorrhage is suspected, reinjection with a second dose of labeled RBCs may identify the bleeding site. ",0
"Performing screening flexible sigmoidoscopy using colonoscopes: experience in 500 subjects. There is still controversy regarding the optimal length of flexible sigmoidoscopes. We performed screening distal colon examinations using 168-cm colonoscopes in 500 asymptomatic subjects who were unsedated and had sigmoidoscopy cleansing preparation. The mean depth of penetration was 66 cm and was similar in persons in whom the examination was discontinued because of poor preparation versus those with discomfort. Polyps were detected in 87 patients, but only 5 subjects had polyps detected above 60 cm. We conclude that in a group of unsedated subjects scheduled for flexible sigmoidoscopy after a sigmoidoscopy prep, the use of instruments longer than 60 cm gives very little additional yield. ",0
"Hashimoto's encephalopathy: a steroid-responsive disorder associated with high anti-thyroid antibody titers--report of 5 cases. We describe 5 patients with a relapsing encephalopathy in association with Hashimoto's disease and high titers of anti-thyroid antibodies. The presentation is usually with a subacute onset of confusion, alteration in conscious level, and focal or generalized seizures. The relapsing course, association with myoclonus or tremulousness, and episodes of stroke-like deterioration are characteristic features. The long-term prognosis is favorable with steroid therapy, though additional immunosuppressive therapy may be required. Neurologic investigation typically shows a diffusely abnormal EEG, high CSF protein level without pleocytosis, and normal brain CT and cerebral angiogram. Isotope brain scan may show patchy abnormal uptake. Hashimoto's encephalopathy should be recognized as a definite neurologic entity and added to the list of CNS complications of thyroid disease. ",0
"The gonadotropin-releasing hormone associated peptide reduces calcium entry in prolactin-secreting cells. The precursor molecule to the GnRH contains a peptide named GnRH-associated peptide (GAP) with PRL-inhibiting properties. In this work, we have studied the electrophysiological properties and responses to GAP of three different types of PRL-secreting cells: 1) the rat tumor cell line GH3, 2) normal rat pituitary cells in primary culture, and 3) human PRL-secreting adenoma cells. Using different but complementary techniques we show that GAP reduces intracellular Ca++ levels, [Ca++]i, and inhibits Ca++ transients in these cells. This reduction of [Ca++]i results from coordinate actions of GAP on K+ and Ca++ conductances and may explain the inhibitory effect of GAP on hormonal secretion by PRL-secreting cells. ",0
"The role of endoscopic injection sclerotherapy in the management of bleeding peristomal varices. Peristomal varices usually occur in patients with enterostomies who develop portal hypertension, and represent a cause of recurrent or intractable gastrointestinal bleeding. Treatment options for such bleeding include surgical ligation of varices, stoma revision with devascularization, injection sclerotherapy, portacaval shunt, or liver transplantation. We reviewed the records of seven patients with peristomal varices, who were followed for a mean of 17 months after diagnosis. Fourteen episodes of clinically significant peristomal bleeding occurred in six patients. Surgical ligation of varices was ineffective in controlling bleeding in two of three patients, although stoma revision with devascularization was temporarily effective in two other patients. Injection sclerotherapy, used in three patients, effectively controlled acute bleeding without serious complications or need for surgery. Definitive treatment for peristomal bleeding (portacaval shunt or liver transplantation) has prevented any further bleeding in three patients for a mean of 8 months after surgery. ",0
"Multiple-pulse stimulation and dantrolene in malignant hyperthermia. A potentially fatal condition, yet preventable, malignant hyperthermia (MH) lacks a satisfactory noninvasive diagnostic test. Studying the effects of intravenous dantrolene (3 mg/kg) on electrically stimulated skeletal muscle, we found that this approach does not conclusively distinguish between normal humans and those susceptible to malignant hyperthermia but nonetheless yielded important information about the action of dantrolene in man and in MH. Supramaximal single- and multiple-pulse stimulation of the common peroneal nerve produced stable torque responses of the dorsiflexor muscles (monitored in vivo), which dantrolene suppressed. With the multiple-pulse stimulation (5-6 pulses) this torque suppression was significantly less in MH-susceptible subjects than in control subjects. This distinction, also observed in MH swine, confirms this animal as a good model for human MH. That dantrolene's effect in MH can be more completely reversed with high frequency stimulation is intriguing; presumably, excitation-contraction coupling differs in MH and normal muscle. ",0
"Stroke rehabilitation: a geropsychological perspective. Rehabilitation medicine and geriatric medicine are similar in their concern for functional improvement in the face of chronic medical conditions. Although many patients served by rehabilitation medicine fall within the geriatric age range, a knowledge of normal aging does not necessarily inform clinical decision making or research practices in rehabilitation. Using stroke as an example of a disorder affecting primarily geriatric patients and requiring the technology of rehabilitation, ways in which age might affect assessment of outcome are examined. Three areas dealing with conceptual and methodologic issues--depression, neurochemical interventions, and family--are highlighted. The final section outlines recommendations for research on rehabilitation outcome of geriatric stroke patients. ",0
"Surgical management of oculomotor nerve palsy We treated seven patients with unilateral oculomotor nerve palsy by transposition of the insertion of the superior oblique tendon to a point anterior and medial to the insertion of the superior rectus muscle without trochleotomy (Scott procedure). Additionally, large recessions of the lateral rectus muscle of involved eyes and, occasionally, recess/resect procedures of horizontal recti muscles of non-involved eyes were performed. All patients were followed up between one and eight years. Orthophoria in the primary position was achieved and maintained with one operation in four patients. A fifth patient had only a small residual exotropia. In two patients who had aberrant regeneration of the oculomotor nerve, surgery on horizontal recti muscles of the noninvolved eye improved the eyelid position of the involved eye after three operations.

"Deep femoral to anterior tibial bypass after failed femoropopliteal reconstructions. Deep femoral to anterior tibial artery bypass is a reconstructive technique occasionally applicable when more conventional attempts at revascularization of the distal portion of the leg have failed. Three such patients, in whom the anterior tibial was the only distal patent branch of the popliteal artery, had severe symptoms of arterial insufficiency. Deep femoral to anterior tibial bypass was done using autogenous The distal portion of the deep femoral artery was exposed through an anteromedial distal thigh approach. The three patients have been followed up for a mean of 20.3 months, and each maintains graft patency and marked symptomatic improvement. ",0
"Closure of refractory perineal Crohn's lesion. Integration of hyperbaric oxygen into case management. A case is reported in which a comprehensive program of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO), surgical debridement and reconstruction, and continuing medical management resulted in complete and sustained closure of an extensive perineal Crohn's lesion refractory to conventional medical and surgical management. It is emphasized that in this case healing occurred in the setting of previous removal of all diseased intestinal tissue and only with the combined use of all three treatment modalities. HBO may be a useful adjunct in the therapy of large nonhealing perineal lesions post-proctocolectomy in patients who are unresponsive to metronidazole or to immunosuppressant therapy or who experience limiting side effects from continued medical therapy.

"Rehabilitation of three patients after treatment for herpes encephalitis. Patients with Herpes simplex encephalitis often are considered to be poor rehabilitation candidates because of their multiple deficits and grave prognosis. This report presents case reports on three patients with biopsy-proven Herpes simplex encephalitis, all of whom were treated with acyclovir in acute care and then admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation program. All had multiple brain lesions with minimal motor findings but cognitive and communication deficits. One patient, two weeks after admission, slipped into a coma and was transferred to an acute care hospital where he subsequently expired. The other two made useful functional gains and were discharged home in two weeks and 10 weeks, suggesting that a trial of rehabilitation may be warranted after Herpes simplex encephalitis. ",0
"Deletion of Alu sequences in the fifth c-sis intron in individuals with meningiomas. An abnormality in the c-sis protooncogene was identified in leukocyte DNA from members of a family predisposed to the development of meningioma, and was found to be associated with the development of the tumor in those individuals. Molecular analysis of this abnormality demonstrated a deletion within the fifth intron of the c-sis gene. The normal c-sis gene has an Alu sequence in this region which includes two perfect 130 nucleotide repeated sequences separated by 5 bp. The deleted c-sis allele is missing precisely one copy of the 130 bp repeat and the intervening 5 bp. An identical deletion was also found in DNA from 1 of 13 sporadic meningiomas. ",0
"A double-blind study of deflazacort and prednisone in patients with chronic inflammatory disorders. Deflazacort and prednisone were given to 26 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, or other chronic inflammatory diseases, in a double-blind study. Deflazacort rapidly and effectively suppressed disease activity in a manner supporting its assumed therapeutic potency of 83% that of prednisone. Prednisone induced a rapid increase in the level of daily calcium excretion that was not evident with deflazacort. Cortisol secretion was acutely inhibited by prednisone, but not by deflazacort. Neither corticosteroid had a significant effect on glucose metabolism, at the doses studied. Treatment with deflazacort may be an effective alternative to prednisone treatment, with fewer adverse effects on levels of calcium and cortisol, in patients with severe inflammatory conditions warranting the use of glucocorticoids.

"Angiography, angioscopy, and ultrasound imaging before and after percutaneous balloon angioplasty. We report two patients undergoing peripheral percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in whom angiography, angioscopy, and ultrasound imaging were performed before and after balloon angioplasty. The first case with smooth atheroma diagnosed by angiography was found to have unrecognized partially occlusive thrombus by angioscopy. After angioplasty, an intimal tear was identified by angioscopy and ultrasound but it was not seen by angiography. The intravascular ultrasound image showed the tear to extend to the adventitia. In the second case, an apparently smooth intimal surface as imaged by angiography was found by angioscopy and ultrasound to have extensive damage, including subintimal hemorrhage, intimal flaps, and arterial dissection at the angioplasty site. These data suggest that the type of information derived from the three imaging techniques is quite different, and that each may have a specific role in intravascular diagnosis. ",0
"A successful treatment of an intrarenal arteriovenous fistula by percutaneous embolization. A 37-year-old woman patient, known to have poorly controlled arterial hypertension that was diagnosed following a cerebrovascular accident at the age of 15 years, was referred to our outpatient clinic for investigation in 1987. An intrarenal arteriovenous fistula was diagnosed by selective renal angiography. Embolization of the fistula was performed using four 15-mm/5-cm coils, which induced thrombosis and obstructed the fistula. The vascularization of the affected kidney improved immediately. During the following 4 months, the antihypertensive treatment was stopped gradually, and the patient remained normotensive. This is an unusual case of a large intrarenal arteriovenous fistula, whose etiology was not clear, that was successfully treated by percutaneous embolization. ",0
"The influence of calcium alginate haemostatic swabs upon operative blood loss in adenotonsillectomy. Although adenotonsillectomy is regarded as a minor procedure, it has been shown that 18% of patients may experience an operative blood loss of 10-20% of the total blood volume. The aim of this study was to determine whether calcium alginate haemostatic swabs reduce operative blood loss in adenotonsillectomy. Seventy-two patients (ages 2-12 years) entered a prospective trial in which the operation was performed either with normal gauze swabs or calcium alginate swabs. Thirty-six children were randomized to each group. The mean blood loss was found to be 34.9 ml (2.07% of total blood volume) and 47.8 ml (2.97% of total blood volume) respectively. Although there was no significant reduction in operative blood loss using calcium alginate, in both groups the blood loss was much smaller than that stated by the majority of previous workers. ",0
"Reversal of chronic hepatic encephalopathy by colonic exclusion: poor correlation with blood GABA levels. Previous studies have suggested that the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a key factor in the syndrome of portasystemic encephalopathy. We report the case of a patient with medically intractable portasytemic encephalopathy after portacaval shunt who had marked clinical improvement after creation of an end ileostomy. Plasma GABA and serum ammonia levels were measured before and after ileostomy. Although the clinical syndrome and the EEG improved markedly after the ileostomy, the plasma GABA levels remained markedly elevated. Preoperative and postoperative GABA levels were 865 and 633 pmol/ml, respectively (nl = 100-180 pmol/ml). Our findings confirm previous reports of the efficacy of colonic exclusion in patients with intractable portasystemic encephalopathy. However, our results conflict with the hypothesis that GABA itself is the key mediator of the syndrome. ",0
"Dietary fat and risk of breast cancer. The relationship between dietary fat and subsequent risk of breast cancer was studied in 3988 initially cancer-free Finnish women aged 20-69 y. During a follow-up period of 20 y, 54 breast-cancer cases were diagnosed. Risk of breast cancer was significantly inversely related to energy intake and nonsignificantly inversely related to absolute fat intake. A positive association between energy-adjusted total fat intake and occurrence of breast cancer was also observed. The relative risk in the highest tertile as compared with the lowest tertile was 1.7 (95% confidence limits 0.6-4.8). The corresponding relative risks were 1.4 (0.5-3.7) for saturated fatty acids, 2.7 (1.0-7.4) for monounsaturated fatty acids, 1.2 (0.6-2.8) for polyunsaturated fatty acids, and 2.2 (1.0-5.0) for cholesterol intake. Adjustment for different potential confounding factors did not alter the results. The present data suggest that breast cancer is associated inversely with energy intake and weakly positively with energy-adjusted fat intake. ",0
"Reinforcement of incontinent stools in the treatment of encopresis. In this paper, fecal incontinence and constipation were treated in two mentally retarded individuals using a novel intervention wherein incontinent stools were first rewarded in order to increase the frequency of bowel movements. This intervention was implemented only after more traditional pediatric and behavioral treatments were unsuccessful. The reinforcement of incontinent stools procedure resulted in an increase in both the frequency and the number of continent stools for both individuals. Hypotheses regarding the failure of previous treatments and the success of the current treatment are discussed as well as directions for future research. ",0
"Background review and current concepts of reperfusion injury. We define the concept of reperfusion injury, and we present a background chronology of experimental work supporting and questioning this concept. We identify several new influences, such as current clinical interest in thrombolytic therapy for acute ischemia of heart and brain and the growing recognition of endothelium as a regulator of homeostasis. We propose that these influences will encourage a reexamination of reperfusion injury as a factor in the ultimate outcome of tissue exposed to reversible ischemia. We briefly discuss the major mechanisms presently implicated in reperfusion injury--loss of calcium homeostasis, free radical generation, leukocyte-mediated injury, and acute hypercholesterolemia.

"Infantile CNS spongy degeneration--14 cases: clinical update. We studied 14 Arab infants with infantile spongy degeneration, 13 of whom were products of consanguineous marriages. They presented in infancy with macrocephaly, poor visual behavior or blindness, and axial hypotonia with appendicular spasticity. Brain CT and MRI showed diffuse symmetric leukoencephalopathy, even before neurologic symptoms. There were relatively normal EEGs. The visual evoked responses (P100) were either absent or delayed early in the course. The brainstem auditory evoked responses showed milder abnormalities, with loss of later components before the earlier ones. Deficient aspartoacylase activity in cultured fibroblasts or brain biopsy confirmed the diagnosis in all patients. ",0
"Pseudocyst of the auricle: successful treatment with intracartilaginous trichloroacetic acid and button bolsters. Pseudocyst of the auricle is an asymptomatic, noninflammatory cystic swelling that typically involves the anthelix of the ear and results from an accumulation of fluid within an unlined intracartilaginous cavity. We report a patient with a recurrent pseudocyst of the auricle and describe a new surgical technique for treating this condition by applying 50% trichloroacetic acid to the intracartilaginous cavity and utilizing external button bolsters for compressive therapy. This therapeutic approach is simple to perform in the office, results in permanent resolution of the pseudocyst, preserves the normal architecture of the external ear, and provides excellent postoperative and long-term cosmetic results.

"Use of the fistula assessment monitor to detect stenoses in access fistulae. Twenty-three unselected hemodialysis patients with functioning access arteriovenous fistulae were studied prospectively to determine the best technique for detecting stenoses within the fistulae. Combined clinical assessment and fistula assessment monitoring were compared with transbrachial angiography. Fistula assessment monitoring was more accurate (96%) than combined clinical assessment (accuracy, 52%) in stenosis detection. Complications of angiography occurred in 17% of patients; there were no complications of fistula assessment monitoring. Fistula assessment monitoring was better than combined clinical assessment in predicting clinical outcome for arteriovenous fistulae over 6 months and was as good as angiography. Routine fistula assessment monitoring could reduce inappropriate angiography and detect clinically significant silent stenoses. It is an ideal method for monitoring arteriovenous access fistulae. ",0
"Reversal of chronic hepatic encephalopathy by colonic exclusion: poor correlation with blood GABA levels. Previous studies have suggested that the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a key factor in the syndrome of portasystemic encephalopathy. We report the case of a patient with medically intractable portasytemic encephalopathy after portacaval shunt who had marked clinical improvement after creation of an end ileostomy. Plasma GABA and serum ammonia levels were measured before and after ileostomy. Although the clinical syndrome and the EEG improved markedly after the ileostomy, the plasma GABA levels remained markedly elevated. Preoperative and postoperative GABA levels were 865 and 633 pmol/ml, respectively (nl = 100-180 pmol/ml). Our findings confirm previous reports of the efficacy of colonic exclusion in patients with intractable portasystemic encephalopathy. However, our results conflict with the hypothesis that GABA itself is the key mediator of the syndrome. ",0
"Serial neurobehavioral assessments in preterm infants. The purpose of this study was to compare serial neurobehavioral assessments in a sample of preterm infants with intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) to those of a group of unaffected preterm infants. Of the 30 infants included in the study, 5 infants had a grade III or IV/VI intraventricular hemorrhage. Infants with IVH demonstrated more abnormalities in mental status and a cluster of abnormal neurologic findings (persistent ankle clonus, tremulousness, and brisk deep tendon reflexes). Of the 30 infants, 20 infants were included in a brain metabolism study. Infants who had experienced an IVH had significantly different brain metabolism findings, as measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). There was a significant correlation between one measure of brain metabolism (PCr/PI) and the neurobehavioral assessment rating for infants with IVH. ",0
"Endothelial cell adhesiveness for human T lymphocytes is inhibited by transforming growth factor-beta 1. Recombinant human transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) was found to inhibit the adhesive phenotype of human umbilical vein endothelial cells for human PBL, purified T lymphocytes, and PHA-activated lymphoblasts. TGF-beta inhibited lymphocyte attachment to resting human umbilical vein endothelial cells and also to endothelial monolayers stimulated with the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta. Our investigations also show that the ability of endothelial cells to respond to TGF-beta by altering their adhesiveness is lost with prolonged culture of the cells. However, this loss is selective as TGF-beta inhibits cell proliferation in both early and late passage endothelial cells. These results suggest that in vivo TGF-beta may inhibit the adhesive phenotype of endothelial cells and also may limit the immunologic response occurring at the endothelial cell barrier. ",0
"Discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs in children who have outgrown epilepsy: effects on cognitive function. Cognitive function is frequently impaired in children with epilepsy, compared with age-matched controls. It can be hard to evaluate the significance of various contributory factors. The effects of antiepileptic drugs may be studied in children who have outgrown their epilepsy but are still being treated. A multicenter study to assess various aspects of cognitive function in children with different forms of epilepsy, both during and after treatment with antiepileptic drugs, is currently under way. Definitive results are not yet available; interim analysis of the findings suggests that short-term memory is decreased in all subgroups of children being treated for epilepsy, compared to controls.

"Tables for estimation of individual risks of fetal neural tube and ventral wall defects, incorporating prior probability, maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels, and ultrasonographic examination results. Tables are provided for estimation of the risk of open spina bifida in patients who have elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels but normal results on detailed anatomy ultrasonographic scan. Risks are provided for various prior population risks, for various levels of elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein, and for various assumptions about the sensitivity of ultrasonographic examination. The formula used is based on sequential multiplication of odds with the use of Bayes' theorem, but an arbitrary reduction (to the power of 0.5) in the degree to which ultrasonographic information modifies the odds has been made to allow for the nonindependence of ultrasonography and maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein tests. The wide range of resulting risks shows that the decision to offer amniocentesis after a negative scan should be individualized. ",0
Spinal coning after lumbar puncture in prostate cancer with asymptomatic vertebral metastasis: a case report. A 60-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for complete urinary retention. Prostate cancer was diagnosed and anti-cancer chemotherapy was administered. Regression of prostatic enlargement was appreciated and difficult urination improved. At 6 months after the initial treatment vertebral metastasis of T10-11 was noted on a bone scintigram but there were no symptoms induced by bone metastasis. Orchiectomy was performed with the patient under lumbar anesthesia. Complete paralysis of both lower extremities occurred postoperatively. Computerized tomography and myelographic findings demonstrated complete subarachnoid block with an extramedullary spinal cord tumor. It was concluded that traction on the spinal cord producing neurological deterioration (spinal coning) occurred after removal of the cerebrospinal fluid by lumbar puncture. ,0
"Left atrial to femoral arterial bypass using the biomedicus pump for operations of the thoracic aorta. Left atrial to left femoral arterial bypass is an approach to operations of the thoracic aorta dating back to the late 1950s. Since that time, various modifications of the basic bypass circuit have evolved. In addition, temporary bypass shunts have also been described in a variety of positions. The goals of bypass of the thoracic aorta regardless of the technique include prevention of distal hypoperfusion, which can lead to paraplegia, limb loss, multiple organ failure, and sometimes death. Recently, there have been reports of the use of the biomedicus centrifugal pump in bypass circuits of the thoracic aorta. Our series, as well as the success of others, using this variation of a traditional bypass circuit of the thoracic aorta, establishes the biopump's capability of minimizing inherent complications in the bypass circuit.

"Acute deterioration of renal function associated with enteric hyperoxaluria. Enteric hyperoxaluria due to malabsorption syndromes has been well documented to cause renal calculi and chronic tubulointerstitial renal damage. Rarely, in the setting of intestinal bypass operations for morbid obesity, enteric hyperoxaluria has produced acute renal failure. We report two patients who suffered acute deterioration of renal function associated with increased intestinal absorption and renal excretion of oxalate associated with steatorrhea. One patient had a large portion of his small bowel resected many years prior to the onset of the renal failure and the second patient had chronic pancreatitis causing steatorrhea. Both patients had renal biopsy documentation of the acute nature of the tubular damage produced by oxalate deposition. The mechanisms of their deterioration of renal function may relate to sudden increases in steatorrhea in association with episodes of volume depletion. Enteric hyperoxaluria may be an easily overlooked and potentially preventable etiology of acute renal dysfunction. ",0
"Experience with esmolol for the treatment of cocaine-associated cardiovascular complications. The authors report their experience using esmolol, an ultra-short acting beta-adrenergic antagonist, for the treatment of seven patients with cocaine-associated cardiovascular complications. No consistent hemodynamic benefit was found with the use of this drug. Although there was a decline in mean heart rate of 23% (range 0% to 35%), they were unable to show a consistent antihypertensive response. Adverse effects occurred in three patients. This included one patient with a marked exacerbation of hypertension and one who became hypotensive. Another patient developed emesis and lethargy during esmolol therapy and required endotracheal intubation. They do not recommend the routine use of esmolol for cocaine cardiotoxicity. ",0
"Prospective randomized comparison of Brown-McHardy and microvasive balloon dilators in treatment of achalasia. We report the results of a randomized prospective study comparing a standard bougie rubber balloon dilator [Brown-McHardy (BMH)] and a newer polyethylene dilator passed over a guide wire [Microvasive Rigiflex (MVR)]. Twenty achalasia patients (15M, 5F, mean age 45.4 yr) considered candidates for either dilator were randomized. Symptom assessment, body weight, and upright radionuclide solid esophageal emptying study were measured before and 6 months after pneumatic dilatation. All dilatations were performed by one of three experienced gastroenterologists under fluoroscopic guidance. Overall success occurred with 10/10 BMH and 7/10 MVR. One patient not improved with MVR had myotomy; the other two were successfully treated by BMH. No complications occurred with either dilator. ",0
"Ubiquitin hybrid protein gene expression during human colon cancer progression. Ubiquitin is involved in cell-cycle control and DNA replication through a specific proteolytic pathway. Our previous studies demonstrated selected higher expression of a gene encoding ubiquitin-ribosomal protein S27a in poorly differentiated colon carcinoma cell lines. In this study, we evaluated this ubiquitin hybrid protein gene expression in surgical specimens of colon cancers. Northern blot analysis showed that ubiquitin hybrid protein messenger RNA was overexpressed in primary colon cancers compared with adjacent normal colon mucosae in 17 of 20 patients. Dot blot analysis of RNA of 27 tumor samples revealed significantly greater expression in higher Dukes' stage primary colon tumors and liver metastases. These data imply that protein translation machinery is highly activated during progression and metastasis of colon tumors, and that ubiquitin hybrid protein may be useful as a marker of biological aggressiveness.

"Delayed subcapsular hematoma after percutaneous liver biopsy as a manifestation of warfarin toxicity. Guidelines for the management of patients receiving chronic anticoagulation therapy who require liver biopsy are not clearly defined. In patients with normal coagulation, liver biopsy is a relatively safe procedure with a morbidity of less than 0.1% and a mortality of less than 0.01%. We report a patient with a prosthetic aortic valve who developed a large subcapsular hematoma 12 days after a percutaneous liver biopsy as a consequence of warfarin toxicity. Based on the experience with this patient, reinstitution of anticoagulant therapy should be avoided for at least 72 h after a percutaneous liver biopsy. Intravenous heparin should be resumed first, and warfarin added if no bleeding has occurred after an additional 48-72 h. The prothrombin time should be maintained at 1.5 times the baseline. ",0
"Is sick sinus syndrome an adenosine-mediated disease? Effects of intravenous aminophylline on sick sinus node function after pharmacologic autonomic blockade. To assess the effects of intravenous aminophylline on the sinus node, 12 patients with clinical and Holter monitor-documented sick sinus syndrome were studied (1) during the control state, (2) after pharmacologic autonomic blockade and (3) 5 min after intravenous administration of aminophylline. The effects of aminophylline on sinus node function were compared with those after pharmacologic autonomic blockade. No significant improvement of sinus node function was found after intravenous aminophylline administration with a mean sinus cycle length and a mean maximum CSRT of 968 +/- 218 and 1832 +/- 1036 ms, respectively. The mean serum theophylline level was 10.9 +/- 1.7 micrograms/ml. Since aminophylline is an adenosine receptor antagonist, these findings suggest that intrinsic adenosine may not play an important role in pathogenesis in patients with chronic and advanced sick sinus syndrome.

"The use of internalised ureteric stents in renal transplant recipients. Since 1982, we have used internal indwelling ureteric stents for the management and prevention of ureteric reconstruction complications in 28 renal allograft recipients. A total of 30 stents were placed in 18 patients either diagnostically or therapeutically in the management of allograft ureteric obstruction. In 16 patients internal stents were placed at the time of reconstruction for primary ureteropyelostomy (3), secondary ureteropyelostomy (8), repeat reimplant (3) and repair of ureteric or pelviureteric junction injury (2). Complications included 3 episodes of transplant pyelonephritis, proximal stent migration (1), persistent bacteriuria (1) and prolonged healing of a ureteropyelostomy (1). Internalised ureteric stenting is a safe and effective means of managing or preventing ureteric reconstruction complications in renal transplant recipients. ",0
"Doppler echocardiographic evaluation of streptokinase lysis of thrombosed right-sided St. Jude Medical valves in patients with congenital heart defects. Four episodes of St. Jude Medical prosthesis leaflet thrombosis were serially evaluated by two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography during treatment with streptokinase. Three patients aged 4, 11, and 24 years with congenital heart disease had St. Jude Medical valves in pulmonary positions (two cases) for tetralogy of Fallot and in the tricuspid position (one case). The duration of thrombosis was not known in any patient. Leaflet immobility and its resolution were demonstrated by echocardiography and were confirmed fluoroscopically. Continuous wave Doppler echocardiography showed abnormal stenotic gradients in thrombosed valves that were reduced after thrombolysis. These studies demonstrate the utility of two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography in serial evaluation of prosthetic pulmonary and tricuspid valve thrombosis during thrombolysis. ",0
"Immunoprofile of mucoepidermoid carcinomas of minor salivary glands. Because the data on the antigenic phenotype of mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) are incomplete and somewhat disparate, 45 MECs were evaluated immunohistochemically for low- and high-molecular-weight keratins, vimentin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, smooth muscle actin, and S-100 protein. Tumors stained uniformly for keratins and, on occasion, focally for vimentin. Tumors were nonreactive with antibodies to glial fibrillary acidic protein and, with few exceptions, to muscle-specific actins and S-100 protein. Clear cell and papillary histologic variants were seen as potential diagnostic pitfalls. If used with hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained sections, limited potential is seen for this antibody panel in surgical pathology. Myoepithelial cell-associated antigens are expressed to a very limited extent in MECs. ",0
Study of preneoplastic changes of liver cells by immunohistochemical and molecular hybridization techniques. The status of hepatitis B virus DNA was investigated by in situ hybridization in multifocal areas of a noncancerous hepatitis B virus-associated cirrhosis. This liver exhibited a marked degree of dysplasia and adenomatous hyperplasia. The results of these studies were correlated with the histopathology and immunohistochemical stains for hepatitis B core and surface antigens. There was clear evidence of a marked reduction to absence of hepatitis B viral DNA by in situ hybridization and absence of HBc and HBsAg in the foci of liver cell dysplasia and adenomatous hyperplasia. These results support the hypothesis that liver cell dysplasia and adenomatous hyperplasia are preneoplastic in nature. ,0
"Effects of tracheal irritation and hypercapnia on tracheal smooth muscle in humans. Both hypercapnia and tracheal irritation are known to constrict the airways in animals. To see whether similar responses occur in humans, we investigated tracheal smooth muscle (TSM) responses to hypercapnia and tracheal irritation with water in 14 paralyzed and anesthetized humans. TSM tone was monitored by measuring the pressure in the saline-filled cuff of the endotracheal tube. Although, tracheal irritation caused TSM constriction in 10 of 14 patients, 4 patients showed no TSM response. Administration of intravenous atropine attenuated the TSM constriction response. Hypercapnia did not cause any change in TSM tone in any of the 14 patients. These results indicate that in paralyzed and anesthetized humans, there exist interindividual differences in the TSM responses to tracheal irritation and that hypercapnia cannot be an effective stimulus for the TSM constriction.

"Orthostatic hypotension in human immunodeficiency virus infection may be the result of generalized autonomic nervous system dysfunction. We used an autonomic nervous system (ANS) testing battery to determine if generalized ANS dysfunction was present in five human immunodeficiency virus-positive (HIV+) patients presenting with severe orthostatic hypotension (OH). All five patients had abnormal ANS testing, which demonstrated both sympathetic and parasympathetic defects, i.e., generalized ANS dysfunction. Treatment with fludrocortisone effectively reversed the OH in four of the five patients. The OH was transient in these four patients. We believe it is important to recognize that OH may be the result of generalized ANS dysfunction in HIV-positive patients and that it can be effectively treated. ",0
"Overt hepatic encephalopathy precipitated by zinc deficiency. Encephalopathy in liver disease may be unresponsive to protein restriction, lactulose, and neomycin. Zinc supplements have been reported to improve psychometric performance in liver cirrhosis, but the importance of zinc deficiency in overt hepatic encephalopathy has not yet been clearly established. A patient with severe recurrent hepatic encephalopathy was studied to determine the relation between her signs of encephalopathy and zinc deficiency. The study included a period in which zinc deficiency was artificially induced by oral histidine. An episode of overt encephalopathy occurred that was identical to earlier episodes and responded to oral zinc. The study showed an association between encephalopathy and zinc deficiency by successive zinc depletion and supplementation regimens. Long-term zinc supplementation improved severe recurrent hepatic encephalopathy and therefore the quality of life. ",0
"A randomized trial of the effect of three non-steroid anti-inflammatory agents in ameliorating cancer-induced fever. Paraneoplastic fever is well known, and is not an uncommon problem in daily practice. In an effort to ameliorate tumour-induced fever we randomized 48 patients to receive three different non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs: Naproxen (500 mg d-1), Indomethacin (75 mg d-1) or Diclophenac sodium (75 mg d-1). All patients had solid tumours, and microbial infection had been excluded. All three drugs were equally effective in bringing the temperature down to normal for a period of 30-33 d. Naproxen had the most rapid effect. In cases of fever relapse with the first drug, when the other two drugs were given instead, both proved equally effective. No side-effects were observed. We conclude that Naproxen, Indomethacin and Diclophenac sodium are equally effective in ameliorating paraneoplastic fever. In relapse, a second drug given subsequently can be effective as well. ",0
"Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome terminating as disseminated T-cell lymphoma. The authors describe a case of idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) terminated as a T-cell lymphoma in a 3-year-old girl. The clinical course was chronic and characterized by chronic eczema, persistent peripheral blood eosinophilia, organomegaly, interstitial lung change, and pericarditis. Postmortem examination demonstrated a disseminated T-cell lymphoma involving the inguinal lymph node, liver, lung, and kidney. The findings of the current case suggest a possibility that certain abnormalities in this case of idiopathic HES per se may have triggered the development of malignant lymphoma, and it may represent a transition of idiopathic HES into a T-cell lymphoma. Other possible sequences are discussed. The development of T-cell malignancy in idiopathic HES in a girl is quite an unusual presentation. ",0
"A new method for mapping hepatic subsegment: counterstaining identification technique. Hepatic subsegmentectomy requires identification of the borders of tumor-bearing subsegment, usually achieved by injecting dye into the portal veins feeding the domain. We describe an alternative technique for performing systematic subsegmentectomy in patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, in whom hepatic arterial and portal venous embolizations were already performed as a preoperative adjuvant. Under ultrasonic guidance, each of the neighboring portal units is sequentially stained, thus defining the avascular subsegment to be resected as the nonstaining area. This allows the subsegment to be totally resected. This counterstaining identification technique can be used for all subsegments undergoing complete embolization and for other situations in which the usual staining method is impossible because of the presence of arterioportal shunting or portal tumor thrombus.

"Crohn disease in the pediatric patient: CT evaluation. Computed tomographic (CT) scans and medical records of 25 children (age range, 10-18 years) with pathologically proved Crohn disease were reviewed to better define the role of CT in the management of pediatric patients with Crohn disease. CT findings included small bowel thickening (range, 5-10 mm) (n = 20), colonic wall thickening (range, 6-15 mm) (n = 15), and small bowel dilation (n = 5). Mesenteric abnormalities such as adenopathy and focal fatty proliferation were seen in 11 to 18 patients, respectively. Extraluminal complications were easily identified with CT. Abscesses were noted in seven patients, inflammatory masses in four, and perirectal or perineal inflammation in 10. Fistulas were detected in four patients. The authors conclude that CT should be the initial imaging study performed in children with known Crohn disease and a changing pattern of clinical symptoms. ",0
"The surprising kidney-fluid mechanism for pressure control--its infinite gain! In this short paper, I have tried to explain the elation that we felt when we first realized that the kidney-fluid mechanism for controlling the arterial pressure has an infinite feedback gain property. Because of this, all the other pressure control mechanisms, none of which has ever been shown to have a similar infinite gain property, must themselves alter the kidney-fluid mechanism if they are to succeed in causing long-term changes in the arterial pressure. We have not been able to refute this principle despite many experiments over the last 2 decades. For this reason, our first understanding of the infinite gain property of the kidney-fluid mechanism was like a light at the end of the tunnel. I hope that I can explain to the reader the excitement of those few seconds when we first recognized the principle in 1966. ",0
"Preoperative piroxicam for postoperative analgesia in dental surgery. Fifty patients were allocated randomly to receive placebo or piroxicam 40 mg, 2.5 h before surgical removal of lower third molars under general anaesthesia. A significantly greater number of patients in the piroxicam group did not require opioid analgesia after operation (P less than 0.05). The piroxicam group also required fewer doses of paracetamol in the first 24 h after recovery from anaesthesia (P less than 0.05), and the time from recovery to first postoperative analgesia was longer in those patients who had received piroxicam (P less than 0.05). Piroxicam did not significantly prolong the duration of recovery from anaesthesia. ",0
"Lower respiratory tract infections. Although lower respiratory tract infections are frequently diagnosed in a primary care setting, they are still associated with a significant morbidity and mortality, which warrants a careful approach to treatment. Knowledge of the most common cause based on the age of the patient, location where the infection was acquired, and clinical presentation helps to direct empiric treatment. A few basic laboratory studies, especially a sputum Gram stain, can allow for more specific treatment. Identification of patients at increased risk for virulent organisms should make the primary care physician consider inpatient treatment along with an aggressive diagnostic workup and broad-spectrum antimicrobial treatment. Prevention should always be considered. ",0
"Experimental retinal branch vein occlusion in miniature pigs induces local tissue hypoxia and vasoproliferative microangiopathy. In miniature pigs, retinal veins were experimentally occluded using argon laser coagulation. Microvascular modifications leading to retinal hemorrhages and retinal edema were observed some hours after the occlusion. These lesions resolved progressively within 3 weeks after the occlusion, but in most cases ischemic retinal territories persisted. Preretinal partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) measurements, using double barrelled O2-sensitive microelectrodes, showed that all the ischemic areas were indeed hypoxic. In half of the experiments, preretinal and intravitreal new vessels grew on the ischemic territories. Tissue hypoxia appears to be a key step in triggering neovascularization. However, the critical level of hypoxia was not determined. ",0
"A seromuscular stripping method to create a nipple valve without metal stapling for continent urinary reservoir. Urinary continence with a Kock or Mainz pouch is achieved by a nipple valve of the invaginated ileum which is usually fixed with metal staples. However, metal staples can cause various complications as a foreign body. The seromuscular stripping method, a new technique to create a nipple valve, was applied to 17 patients with bladder cancer in the construction of a continent urinary reservoir by the ileocolonic pouch (Mainz pouch). Metal staples were not used. The results were satisfactory except for 2 patients who became incontinent because of prolapse of the nipple in one and insufficient valve function due to ischemic change of the nipple valve in the other. Histology of the nipple valve from an autopsy case showed a good double layer nipple valve that functioned well to preserve continence. ",0
"Standards for evaluating results of interventional therapy for peripheral vascular disease. Uniform standards for evaluating and reporting the results of therapeutic interventions for peripheral vascular disease are clearly needed. They are already established for vascular surgery, as represented by several reports by SVS/ISCVS committees, but they are not always followed by vascular surgeons and have been largely ignored by other vascular interventionists. In this article, the major problematic reporting practices are discussed and illustrated, and 14 recommendations are advanced to deal with them. They are intended to provide precise definitions, objective criteria of success or failure, standardized severity gradation schemes for peripheral vascular disease and its risk factors, and proper procedures for reporting the outcome of all forms of therapeutic intervention. Until these or some other agreed upon reporting standards are accepted and followed, the literature on peripheral vascular disease and its management will continue to be a source of confusion rather than enlightenment.

"Hemodynamic effects of H2-receptor antagonists. Histamine H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) often are administered to intensive care unit patients in an attempt to reduce gastric acidity and to prevent stress-related mucosal damage. These agents have an extremely low overall incidence and severity of adverse reactions; however, hemodynamically significant hypotension has been noted. Clinical studies with rapidly administered intravenous cimetidine in critically ill patients have demonstrated a depression in blood pressure in up to 75 percent of patients. Ranitidine, also studied in this setting, does not appear to induce similar hemodynamic changes. The newer H2RAs, famotidine and nizatidine, have not been evaluated in critically ill patients. ",0
"Acute water intoxication as a complication of urine drug testing in the workplace Urine drug testing is now mandatory in many industries. We report the first case, to our knowledge, of an adverse consequence of drug testing in the workplace: acute water intoxication. We discuss normal water metabolism and the adverse effects of water loading and impaired renal function on free water clearance. We present a literature review of seven other cases of acute voluntary water intoxication in patients without chronic psychiatric or neurologic illness. For workers undergoing urine drug testing we conclude that risk factors for acute water intoxication include (1) intake of more than 1 L of water and (2) impaired urine dilution. In a recently drug-tested worker, symptoms of cerebral dysfunction should suggest the possibility of water intoxication. ",0
"Assessing the severity of dementia. Patient and caregiver. In dementia there is cognitive impairment, disability in daily life, and sometimes behavioral disturbance. These changes are a burden for the caregivers of patients with dementia. Few studies are available that examine all these aspects and their interrelationships in a single patient group. In our study we selected detailed methods for assessment of all these aspects. Interrelationships were studied in 30 mild to moderately impaired patients with dementia and their caregivers. Although the relations of cognitive deterioration to disability in daily life and of burden experienced by the caregiver to patient's condition were stronger than often reported, it was impossible to deduce the overall severity of dementia from one single aspect. Thus, for effective management of patients and caregivers, for evaluation of individual treatment or of clinical trials, attention should be paid to all the different aspects of patients' condition and caregivers' burden. Outcome measurements will then be more valid. ",0
"Evaluation of the fine needle aspiration biopsy in the preoperative selection of cold thyroid nodules. From 1980 to 1988 the authors examined by fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) 4609 patients with solitary thyroid nodules or multinodular goiters. A total of 5605 ""cold"" thyroid nodules were evaluated and classified, on the basis of the cytologic findings, as malignant, follicular lesions (probably malignant and probably benign) and benign. Then the authors compared the preoperative cytologic findings with the postoperative histologic results in 827 nodules from patients who underwent surgery. In the 805 thyroid nodules in which an adequate cytologic specimen was obtained, false-negative results were 2.3% and false-positive findings were 1.1% By comparing cytologic and histologic diagnoses, preoperative FNAB resulted in the ability to accurately assess the risk of cancer in a thyroid nodule; since 250 nodules were identified as malignant, the risk of a ""cold"" thyroid nodule being cancer was 4.46% in this series.

"Suppressive effects of visceral tumor on the generation of antitumor T cells for adoptive immunotherapy. Antitumor reactive cells can be generated from lymphoid organs of mice bearing subcutaneous (SC), but not liver or lung, tumors by in vitro sensitization with irradiated tumor and interleukin 2. To examine whether visceral tumors mediated tumor-induced suppression, in vitro sensitization cells were generated from mice bearing SC tumors with and without concomitant liver or lung tumors. Antitumor efficacy of these cells was assessed in adoptive immunotherapy experiments. The presence of visceral tumors suppressed the ability to generate therapeutic in vitro sensitization cells from mice with SC tumors. By establishing visceral tumors at different intervals in relationship to SC tumor inoculation, we found that visceral tumor appeared to suppress directly the development of a host immune response to SC tumor, rather than inhibit function of established immune cells. Our model affords a means to study mechanisms of tumor-induced immunosuppression. ",0
"Regional differences in the intranodal distribution of tumor cells. The intranodal distribution of tumor cells was examined in 103 mesenteric and 135 axillary nodes to determine the frequency of a circumferential type of distribution and its relationship, if any, to central necrosis. Eighteen percent of the mesenteric nodes removed at surgery from patients with colon cancer contained a circumferential rim of viable tumor cells in an area corresponding wholly or in part to the normal location of the marginal sinus. In each case this rim of tumor cells surrounded a large central area of necrosis. In contrast, only one of the 135 axillary nodes removed from patients with breast cancer demonstrated this pattern. These findings suggest that by interrupting blood and lymph vessels, the circumferential spread of tumor cells underlies development of central necrosis. Previously described structural dissimilarities between mesenteric and axillary nodes may explain the striking difference in incidence of this pattern in these nodes. ",0
"Thyroidectomy under local anesthesia. Thyroidectomy for benign and malignant disease is most commonly performed with the patient under general anesthesia, although the literature is sprinkled with reports of series of operations performed using local anesthetic techniques. A retrospective review of 43 sequential thyroidectomies compares 21 performed using local anesthesia with 22 performed using general anesthesia. No significant difference was demonstrated in the incidence of major complications. All patients who required a second operation to remove the remaining hemithyroid after the final pathology reports were reviewed elected local anesthesia for their second procedure, attesting to patient satisfaction. Some hemithyroidectomies performed using local anesthesia were outpatient procedures. The indications, guidelines for patient selection, and operative technique of this effective alternative approach to thyroid surgery are presented. ",0
"Aggressive therapeutic amniocentesis for treatment of twin-twin transfusion syndrome. Acute severe twin-twin transfusion syndrome occurs in about 1% of monochorionic twin gestations. In the most severe form, acute hydramnios develops in the recipient twin's sac and fetal hydrops may be present. The donor twin is anemic and oligohydramnios is present, so that the donor appears ""stuck"" in a cocoon made by its adherent amnion. In this report, aggressive therapeutic amniocentesis restored amniotic fluid volume to normal in both sacs in all pregnancies. Fetal hydrops resolved in three of five (60%) of the fetuses affected. Pregnancy was extended a mean 80 +/- 33 days (+/- 2 SD) and perinatal survival was 79%. These findings contrast dramatically with the virtual 100% mortality reported in the literature with no therapy. Repeated aggressive amniocentesis effectively reversed the physiology of twin-twin transfusion syndrome and should be the treatment of choice for acute hydramnios, which previously had no recommended therapy.

"Dissection of the cardinal ligament in radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer with emphasis on the lateral ligament. Surgical experience with carcinomas of the uterus and rectum has provided new insights into the surgical anatomy of a lamina, which separates the paravesical space from the pararectal space. It has been proved that each of the lamina consists of the cardinal and lateral ligaments and pelvic splanchnic nerves, descending in the following order. The cardinal and lateral ligaments, as a connective stalk, insert into the lateral walls of the uterus and rectum extending from the inner aspect of the pelvic wall. Clarification of this structural relationship led to the development of a new procedure for the dissection of the cardinal ligament in radical hysterectomy, while still preserving the lateral ligament. This facilitated systematic dissection of the cardinal and uterosacral ligaments with posterior manipulation, leading to a reduction in blood loss and to prevention of brisk bleeding from the venous plexuses.

"Hemodynamic effects of partial correction of chronic anemia by recombinant human erythropoietin in patients on dialysis. Eighteen patients on chronic hemodialysis with renal anemia were treated with recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO). Hemodynamic parameters in the resting state were determined before and after successful treatment. Posttreatment cardiac index was decreased (3.3 v 2.8 L/min/m2), whereas diastolic blood pressure (72 v 79 mm Hg) and calculated peripheral resistance (2,230 v 2,860 dyne.cm.s-5) were increased significantly when compared with the pretreatment period. We conclude from our study that the increase of blood pressure as seen in patients on dialysis, who are effectively treated with r-HuEPO, is due to an increase in peripheral resistance. This increase overrules the decrease of cardiac index and might well be a result of peripheral vasoconstriction due to improved oxygen availability. ",0
"Peritoneal closure or non-closure at cesarean. The value of peritoneal closure at the time of cesarean birth was evaluated prospectively. Two hundred forty-eight women undergoing low transverse cesarean through a Pfannenstiel skin incision were assigned to one of two groups: peritoneum open (N = 127) or peritoneum closed (N = 121). The mean (+/- SEM) surgical time in the open group (48.1 +/- 1.2 minutes) was significantly less than for the closed group (53.2 +/- 1.4 minutes) (P less than .005). There were no postoperative differences between the groups in the incidence of wound infection, dehiscence, endometritis, ileus, and length of hospital stay. Our study suggests that leaving the parietal peritoneum unsutured is an acceptable way to manage patients at cesarean delivery. ",0
"Use of a central 10 degrees field and size V stimulus to evaluate and monitor small central islands of vision in end stage glaucoma. In a retrospective review of 24 clinically stable eyes with small central islands of vision due to end stage glaucoma the combined use of a central 10 degrees program and size V stimulus (10-2 with V) measured visual function undetected on a central 30 degrees field tested with both the standard size III and non-standard size V stimuli. Furthermore, the mean sensitivity of the 10-2 with V remained stable on serial field testing (mean 3.9 examinations) on long term follow-up (mean 22.2 months). This study suggests that in end stage glaucoma the size V target is the stimulus of choice and a central 10 degrees field may be the program of choice of evaluating and monitoring small central islands of vision.

"Myotonic heart disease: a clinical follow-up. We followed 37 patients with myotonic dystrophy for a mean of 6 years. Two developed atrial flutter or fibrillation, 6 developed a new bundle branch block, 1 developed complete heart block requiring a pacemaker, and another with progressive 1st-degree heart block and a widening QRS interval had a sudden death. Most patients had predictable, gradually progressive disease of their cardiac conduction system. We recommend that patients with progressive atrioventricular block or widening QRS interval due to myotonic heart disease have yearly ECGs and be questioned about syncope or presyncope to determine the need for a cardiac pacemaker.

"Synergism of herpes simplex virus and tobacco-specific N'-nitrosamines in cell transformation. Previous studies indicate that herpes simplex virus (HSV) enhances the carcinogenic activity of smokeless tobacco and tobacco-related chemical carcinogens in animals. Since tobacco-specific N'-nitrosamines (TSNAs) such as N'-nitrosonornicotine (NNN) and 4-(N-methyl-N'-nitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) are major chemical carcinogens of smokeless tobacco and are known to be responsible for the development of oral cancers in smokeless tobacco users, the combined effects of TSNAs and HSV in cell transformation were investigated. Exposure of cells to NNN or NNK followed by virus infection resulted in a significant enhancement of transformation frequency when compared with that observed with chemical carcinogens or virus alone. This study suggests that TSNAs and HSV can interact together and show synergism in cell transformation. ",0
"Home blood pressure readings in borderline hypertensive patients. Home blood pressure monitoring can provide valuable information for physicians managing borderline hypertensive patients. This study was conducted to compare office and home blood pressures in 36 borderline hypertensive subjects, and to determine the accuracy of the home monitoring unit used. The patients were very willing to record their home blood pressures for an extended period of time. The home blood pressure monitors were found to be quite accurate, and blood pressures measured at home were significantly lower than readings obtained in the office. In 39% (14 of 36) of the subjects studied, the average home blood pressures were more than 10 mmHg lower than their office readings. These findings support the hypothesis that home blood pressure monitoring can be useful in the management of borderline hypertensive patients. ",0
"Elevated serum bromide concentrations following repeated halothane anaesthesia in a child. A 20-month-old child received 25 brief halothane general anaesthetics over a five-week period to allow cranial irradiation treatments for a posterior fossa ependymoma. Personality change during the last week of the treatment protocol raised the question of possible bromide intoxication. Serum bromide concentrations, using a gold chloride assay technique, were monitored at that time, and at four- and six-week intervals thereafter. Serum bromide concentrations demonstrated a four-fold change during this period ranging from peak levels of 2.2 mEq.L-1 (176 micrograms.kg-1) during the fifth week of treatment decreasing to less than 0.5 mEq.L-1 (less than 40 micrograms.ml-1) six weeks following the end of treatments. This demonstrates the possibility for repetitive, short halothane exposures to result in elevations of serum bromide and the potential of bromide intoxication in paediatric neuro-oncology patients.

"Regional differences in the intranodal distribution of tumor cells. The intranodal distribution of tumor cells was examined in 103 mesenteric and 135 axillary nodes to determine the frequency of a circumferential type of distribution and its relationship, if any, to central necrosis. Eighteen percent of the mesenteric nodes removed at surgery from patients with colon cancer contained a circumferential rim of viable tumor cells in an area corresponding wholly or in part to the normal location of the marginal sinus. In each case this rim of tumor cells surrounded a large central area of necrosis. In contrast, only one of the 135 axillary nodes removed from patients with breast cancer demonstrated this pattern. These findings suggest that by interrupting blood and lymph vessels, the circumferential spread of tumor cells underlies development of central necrosis. Previously described structural dissimilarities between mesenteric and axillary nodes may explain the striking difference in incidence of this pattern in these nodes. ",0
"A protocol for the investigation of pregnancy loss. A protocol for the evaluation of pregnancy loss should include a maternal history, dysmorphic examination of the fetus or abortus, photographs, autopsy, chromosome studies (in most cases), and radiographic or xeroradiographic studies. Selected cases with suspected ascending or transplacental infection may require microbiologic investigation. Increasing specialized laboratory techniques may help in the diagnosis of inborn errors of metabolism or storage disorders. Coordination of studies requires the interaction of OB/GYN, pathology, genetics, cytogenetics, and nursing in order to assure delivery of this clinical service. Knowledge of the causes of pregnancy loss and their typical time and mode of presentation can facilitate a focused evaluation, with a high chance of achieving an accurate diagnosis. The goal of all investigations is to provide families with recurrence risk data on which to base future childbearing decisions, as well as information on potential prenatal monitoring. ",0
"Premature alveolar bone loss in Erdheim-Chester disease. Erdheim-Chester disease is a rare histiocytosis also known as lipoid granulomatosis. Oral findings have not been reported previously to our knowledge. This case report documents evidence of oral sequelae of Erdheim-Chester disease. A patient whose course was followed for 10 years at the National Institutes of Health had premature alveolar bone resorption. He underwent full-mouth extraction at age 29 years because of severe periodontitis. Histopathologic evidence of Erdheim-Chester disease was demonstrated in the periodontal soft tissues. In the ensuring years, accelerated resorption of the residual ridges precluded the use of conventional dentures. We recommend early preventive dental management for patients with Erdheim-Chester disease. ",0
"A recurrent pelvic desmoid tumor successfully treated with tamoxifen. A case of recurrent retroperitoneal desmoid tumor successfully treated with tamoxifen (Nolvadex tablets, ICI Pharma, Division of ICI Americas, Wilmington, DE) is reported. The patient presented late in her second pregnancy with a large retroperitoneal pelvic desmoid tumor that was treated with surgical excision and megestrol acetate. When the tumor recurred 12 months later, it was again treated with surgery, this time followed by radiation therapy. The desmoid tumor quickly recurred. The patient was then treated with tamoxifen, resulting in a complete tumor regression that has remained stable for 27 months. Tamoxifen should be considered as first-line therapy in recurrent desmoid tumors. ",0
"Push-enteroscopy for diagnosis of patients with gastrointestinal bleeding of obscure origin. Push-enteroscopy using a disinfected colonoscope was performed on 39 patients with gastrointestinal bleeding of obscure origin. Our results show that: (1) A high percentage of patients (38%) have pathological lesions responsible for bleeding located in the distal duodenum and proximal jejunum, which are readily detected by push-enteroscopy. (2) Duodeno-jejunal arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are the most common cause for bleeding, and these lesions can be conveniently cauterized through the endoscope. (3) An efficient sequence of steps for diagnosis of patients with this problem includes push-enteroscopy when the initial EGD and colonoscopy are normal followed by small bowel radiography. Mesenteric angiography and intraoperative enteroscopy can be reserved for patients with severe bleeding when push-enteroscopy and small bowel radiography are negative. We conclude that push-enteroscopy has an important role to play in the early assessment of patients with gastrointestinal bleeding of obscure origin. ",0
Possible role of leukotrienes in gastritis associated with Campylobacter pylori. This study was done to evaluate the role of leukotrienes (LTs) in gastritis associated with Campylobacter pylori. Biopsy specimens of gastric mucosa were obtained endoscopically from 18 patients with nonulcer dyspepsia for bacteriological and histological examination and extraction of LTs. There was correlation between the LTB4 level in the mucosa and the degree of gastritis evaluated histologically. The level was higher when infiltration of neutrophils in the gastric mucosa was more extensive. The LTB4 level in mucosa infected with C. pylori was higher than that in noninfected mucosa. These findings suggest that endogenous LTs may be related to the pathogenesis of gastritis associated with C. pylori. ,0
"Cochlear implant flap complications. In a series of 52 patients who received cochlear implants, 4 patients suffered flap complications (7.7%). The problems encountered involved the postauricular flap and were usually minor in nature. None required explantation as a direct result of these complications. Flap ischemia in a patient with Cogan's syndrome and vasculitis, two cases of suture extrusion with one having exposure of the implant, and a case of receiver unit magnet extrusion repaired with a vascularized pericranial flap based upon temporalis muscle are presented. Flap design in patients who have had postauricular incisions demands special consideration. Principles useful for avoiding complications as well as their management are discussed. ",0
"Indications for use of ketoconazole in management of metastatic prostate cancer. Newer methods of androgen ablation for the treatment of metastatic prostatic carcinoma have been developed as alternatives to the standard forms of therapy, oral estrogens and surgical castration. The purpose of this review is to elucidate the indications and to determine the role of ketoconazole in the management of metastatic prostatic cancer. Eighteen patients have been treated with ketoconazole. The indications for usage have included: prompt therapeutic response, when orchiectomy is contraindicated, when estrogens are contraindicated, initial empirical therapy, and hormonally refractory disease. It can also be used in conjunction with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogues. Ketoconazole is excellent for short-term usage prior to bilateral orchiectomy and when prompt therapeutic response is needed but orchiectomy cannot be performed. However, it is not particularly useful for long-term hormonal therapy. ",0
"Middle cerebral artery strokes causing homonymous hemianopia: positron emission tomography. Eight patients were evaluated with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography between 3 and 30 days after isolated stroke involving the middle cerebral artery territory that caused homonymous hemianopia. Diffuse hypometabolism was present throughout the damaged cerebral hemisphere, even in cortical areas not obviously ischemic by clinical examination or neuro-imaging. Glucose metabolism in primary and association visual cortex of the damaged hemisphere was decreased by more than 47% (p less than 0.01). Metabolism in the undamaged hemisphere was less profoundly affected, but significant decrements were found in calcarine (40%; p less than 0.01) and lateral occipital cortex (35%; p less than 0.05).

"Tuberculous psoas muscle abscess following chemoprophylaxis with isoniazid in a patient with human immunodeficiency virus infection. A 34-year-old man with human immunodeficiency virus infection and disseminated Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium intracellulare infection developed a right psoas muscle abscess due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The abscess occurred 18 months after completion of a 12-month course of chemoprophylaxis with isoniazid that was given because of a positive reaction with purified protein derivative of tuberculin. The adjacent vertebrae did not appear to be involved. The abscess was drained with a percutaneously inserted catheter, and he received standard antituberculous chemotherapy. Three weeks into therapy, a second drainage with a catheter was required. The isolation of two mycobacteria in this patient and the apparent failure of chemoprophylaxis with isoniazid are noted. ",0
"Aggravation of human and experimental myasthenia gravis by contrast media. After observing a 72-year-old myasthenic patient develop an acute myasthenic exacerbation following the administration of routine diagnostic IV contrast material, an observation rarely described in the literature, we used the experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis model in rabbits injected with a contrast agent to simulate the situation. There was significant worsening of the decremental response to 3 Hz repetitive nerve stimulation from 40 +/- 29% to 55 +/- 27% following the IV administration of contrast agent at doses similar to those used in humans. IV calcium partially reversed this aggravation. Caution is merited when myasthenic patients are administered contrast media. ",0
"Prospective randomized comparison of intravesical with percutaneous bacillus Calmette-Guerin versus intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin in superficial bladder cancer. Conflicting reports of the necessity for percutaneous bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) administration with intravesical BCG prompted us to evaluate its benefit in a randomized prospective comparison of intravesical versus intravesical with percutaneous BCG therapy. Intravesical Tice BCG was given in a dose of 50 mg. with or without percutaneous BCG weekly for 6 weeks, at 8, 10 and 12 weeks, at 6 months and every 6 months thereafter. Tumor recurrence was documented in 13 of 30 patients (43%) receiving only intravesical BCG and in 15 of 36 patients (42%) receiving intravesical plus percutaneous BCG. The addition of percutaneous BCG to intravesical therapy did not increase treatment efficacy in this study. ",0
"Vasal injuries during childhood and their effect on subsequent fertility. Thirty subfertile males had testicular obstruction following inguinal or pelvic surgery in childhood. All 13 patients with bilateral obstruction were azoospermic and 6 had developed antibodies to spermatozoa. Of 17 patients with unilateral obstruction, 11 had oligozoospermia and 6 had normal sperm counts: all had high titres of antibodies to spermatozoa (a significant difference from the men with bilateral obstruction). This indicates that male infertility can result from vasal or epididymal injuries in childhood due either to the obstruction itself or its immunological consequences. Following corrective surgery and prednisolone treatment for the antibodies, where appropriate, 5/17 patients with unilateral blocks and 1/11 with bilateral blocks successfully produced pregnancies.

"Autosomal dominant neovascular inflammatory vitreoretinopathy. Twenty-eight of 61 members of a six-generation family are affected by an autosomal dominant eye disease which has not been described previously. Affected patients are asymptomatic in early adulthood, but have vitreous cells and the selective loss of the b-wave on the electroretinogram. Later, peripheral retinal scarring and pigmentation, peripheral arteriolar closure, and neovascularization of the peripheral retina at the ora serrata or occasionally neovascularization of the optic disc develop. Cystoid macular edema, vitreous hemorrhage, tractional retinal detachment, and neovascular glaucoma can cause profound visual loss. Vitrectomy reduces traction on the retina and allows for retinal reattachment. The role of argon laser photocoagulation or cryopexy in reducing the neovascular complications remains uncertain. ",0
"Pharmacokinetics of tiaprofenic acid after oral administration in fasting patients during and between migraine attacks. This study examined the pharmacokinetics of 300 mg of tiaprofenic acid, a NSAID belonging to the 2-arylpropionic class, as a single oral dose, in 10 migraine patients during and out of migraine attacks. Plasma concentration of tiaprofenic acid was determined by HPLC analysis. Drug absorption appeared to be the same during and out of migraine attacks (absorption half life: during attack, 0.249 +/- 0.122 hr; out of attack, 0.249 +/- 0.105 hr; maximum plasma concentration: during attack, 37.8 +/- 9.8 ug/ml; out of attack, 40.1 +/- 13.2 ug/ml). The other pharmacokinetic parameters evaluated were not affected by headache attacks as well. We conclude that tiaprofenic acid absorption and metabolism are not affected by migraine attacks. Also, our data suggest that tiaprofenic acid might be useful in the treatment of migraine. ",0
"Progressive coma after the transsphenoidal decompression of a pituitary adenoma with marked suprasellar extension: report of two cases. Two cases of neurological deterioration and coma after the transsphenoidal decompression of a pituitary adenoma with marked suprasellar extension and invasion of the 3rd ventricle are presented. Emergency ventricular shunting led to prompt neurological improvement, which, supplemented by radiation therapy, allowed long-term amelioration of symptoms. Three possible explanations for this complication are offered: 1) traction of the attached 3rd ventricle into the decompression site, causing increased obstructive hydrocephalus, 2) vasopressin release by surgical manipulation of the pituitary stalk and circumventricular organs causing cerebral edema, and 3) edema in the residual tumor secondary to surgical manipulation causing further hydrocephalus. Subsequent patients with similar clinical and imaging criteria will have a planned perioperative ventricular shunting procedure performed. ",0
"DNA ploidy pattern in rectal carcinoid tumors. The nuclear DNA pattern of 22 rectal carcinoids was determined by cytophotometry of paraffin embedded tissues. The results were compared with clinical as well as histopathologic features of the tumor. Three of the carcinoids with synchronous or metachronous metastasis had aneuploid DNA pattern, whereas 19 tumors with no metastasis showed diploid DNA pattern. No other single clinical or pathologic feature of the tumor could predict more accurately the malignant potential and the subsequent course of the rectal carcinoid. It is concluded that DNA aneuploidy in rectal carcinoid tumors is not so rare as indicated by earlier studies and that it is a factor of significant prognostic value. ",0
"The prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in the Peoples Republic of China. Meta-analysis on data from 16 (two volunteer and 14 endoscopic) studies ahs been performed to investigate the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in the stomachs of individuals within the Peoples Republic of China. In this survey covering 2216 cases (89 volunteers and 2127 endoscopy patients), the incidence of H. pylori infection in 15- to 22-yr-old healthy volunteers, and in 13- to 88-yr-old symptomatic patients undergoing gastroscopy was 49.4% and 64.5%, respectively. The frequency of H. pylori infection in chronic gastritis (63.6%), gastric ulcer (71.9%), and duodenal ulcer disease (73.1%) differed significantly from that in histologically normal individuals (8.2%), confirming the relationship of H. pylori infection with those disease states. We found no significant association between H. pylori infection and symptoms. ",0
"Drop attacks with Meniere's syndrome. We report the clinical features of 12 patients with drop attacks associated with Meniere's syndrome. Each described a sensation of being pushed, thrown, or knocked to the ground or a sudden illusion of movement of the environment that led to a fall. These episodes were not accompanied by symptoms of their typical attacks of Meniere's syndrome. The drop attacks occurred early and late in the course of the disease; they were the initial manifestation in 1 patient. In the majority the episodes spontaneously remitted, although Meniere's syndrome continued to progress. These attacks probably result from a sudden mechanical deformation of the otolithic membrane of the utricle or saccule due to pressure gradients within the inner ear. They are important to recognize because their prognosis is relatively benign compared to other causes of drop attacks. ",0
"Fetal imaging in the skeletal dysplasias. Second-trimester diagnosis of fetal skeletal dysplasia is becoming increasingly common. By careful examination of the fetus for skeletal mineralization, shape and size of long bones and cranium, and abnormalities of other organ systems, a definitive diagnosis can often be achieved by ultrasound. Fetal radiography is very helpful in giving more information about bone shape and mineralization as well as in confirming the diagnosis. Subsequent obstetric management should be dictated by the natural history of the disease, the parents' wishes, and the gestational age at diagnosis. Because many of these disorders have a high recurrence risk, genetic counseling and follow-up are an important part of the management of these patients. ",0
"Code 9: a systematic approach for responding to medical emergencies occurring in and around a hospital. Members of the public expect to receive efficient and appropriate medical care if they become acutely ill or injured while in or around a hospital. Our institution became aware of the need for an organized system to respond to such emergencies involving patients, visitors, local community residents, and hospital employees, both inside the hospital and on the grounds surrounding the building. A search of the literature did not provide information regarding such a response; a survey of surrounding hospitals revealed no such plan in effect in other institutions. We therefore designed a plan to be superimposed onto our existing system for responding to in-house cardiac and respiratory arrests (""codes""). The results after one and one-half years appear encouraging. We recommend the establishment of such an emergency response system in all health care institutions. ",0
"Dexamethasone increases plasma levels of albendazole. Therapy of neurocysticercosis with cysticidal drugs is frequently complicated by the exacerbation of symptoms that follows the inflammation triggered by the acute destruction of cysticerci. Treatment of such adverse reactions with dexamethasone is highly effective. However, it has been shown that dexamethasone lowers the plasma levels of praziquantel, thus reducing its cysticidal efficacy. We measured plasma levels of albendazole, another strong cysticidal drug, when dexamethasone was given simultaneously. We found that dexamethasone increased the plasma levels of albendazole by about 50% (P less than 0.002); hence, it seems that cysticercosis and the ensuing inflammation can be treated simultaneously with albendazole and dexamethasone without diminishing the efficacy of the cysticidal drug.

"Clinical review 16: Parathyroid hormone-related proteins: coming of age in the 1990s. The last 3 yr have yielded a fertile harvest of new information on the HHM clinical syndrome and on the novel peptide hormone family responsible for the syndrome. Whereas the clinical riddle enshrouding the HHM syndrome first posed in the early 1940s appears to have been largely solved, a whole new field, concerning the physiological role(s) of PTHRP has opened. The field has evolved rapidly and provides an example of fruitful clinical investigation: the original problem was a clinical one (the HHM syndrome); understanding the clinical disorder led to pursuit of the problem in the laboratory (adenylate cyclase assays, protein purification, molecular cloning, PTHRP synthesis); and observations made in the laboratory have rapidly yielded clinical fruits (PTHRP immunoassays) and opened a new window on normal physiology.

"Acalculus lymphoeosinophilic cholecystitis associated with interleukin-2 and lymphokine-activated killer cell therapy. A case of unusual cholecystitis that developed on completion of interleukin-2 and lymphokine-activated killer cell therapy is described. A 62-year-old man was treated with interleukin-2 and lymphokine-activated killer cells for disseminated renal cell carcinoma. During the course of the immunotherapy, his serum alkaline phosphatase level increased, as did the peripheral eosinophil count (0.31). Subsequently, clinical and radiologic evidence of acute cholecystitis was noted. The removed gallbladder showed acalculus cholecystitis with extensive diffuse infiltrates of numerous eosinophils and T lymphocytes, but sparse polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The authors name this unusual cholecystitis acalculus lymphoeosinophilic cholecystitis and believe it to be associated with interleukin-2 and lymphokine-activated killer cell therapy. The pathogenic relationship is discussed. ",0
"Mutagen sensitivity in patients with head and neck cancers: a biologic marker for risk of multiple primary malignancies. Eighty-four patients with head and neck cancers were evaluated for in vitro sensitivity to mutagens and then followed longitudinally for development of multiple primary malignancies. We assessed mutagen sensitivity by exposing lymphocytes to bleomycin in vitro and quantitating the bleomycin-induced chromosomal breaks per cell. The mutagen-hypersensitive patients, ie, those who expressed greater than 1.0 break per cell, were significantly more likely to develop multiple primary cancers than were patients who were less sensitive (less than or equal to 1.0 break per cell) (relative risk = 4.4; 95% confidence limits = 1.2, 15.8). This relationship was independent of age, sex, site, and treatment of first primary cancer and tobacco or alcohol exposures. Sensitivity to bleomycin-induced chromosomal damage serves as an indicator of genetic susceptibility to multiple primary malignancies in patients with head and neck cancers. ",0
"Pseudotumor of the craniocervical junction during long-term hemodialysis. A systematic study of the upper cervical spine was performed using magnetic resonance imaging in 25 patients (15 men and 10 women) who had been undergoing hemodialysis for more than 10 years. Seven pseudotumors of the periodontoid soft tissue were disclosed, which were similar to the pannus recently described in rheumatoid arthritis. Bone cystic radiolucencies were observed in association with these pseudotumors in 5 patients. The radiolucencies were located in the atlas (1 in the lateral mass and 1 in the anterior branch) and in the axis (3 in the odontoid process and 1 in the vertebral body). No horizontal or vertical atlantoaxial subluxation was demonstrated. These features were observed only in patients who had amyloid arthropathy. They could be a frequent, yet thus far little-recognized, feature of beta 2-microglobulin amyloidosis. ",0
"Edwards' syndrome after the replacement of cryopreserved-thawed embryos. A case of Edwards' syndrome after the replacement of frozen-thawed embryos is reported. The presence of cardiac abnormalities and limb deformities raised the suspicion of chromosomal abnormality. The diagnosis of trisomy 18 was made by cytogenetic analysis of fetal blood from the umbilical vein. The chromosomal nondisjunction might have been spontaneous or because of freezing and thawing. If it occurred as a result of freezing and thawing, it is more likely that this was at the first cleavage division rather than the second meiotic division because the embryos were frozen at the late pronuclear stage. Unfortunately, there were no karyotypic markers in the couple's chromosomes to time the nondisjunction. The wisdom of using donor oocytes in an ovum donation program from patients with long-standing infertility is questioned. ",0
"Use of Mohs micrographic surgery to establish quantitative proof of heightened tumor spread in basal cell carcinoma recurrent following radiotherapy. We compared 27 basal-cell carcinomas (BCCs) recurrent following radiotherapy and subsequently excised by Mohs micrographic surgery to a control group of BCCs recurrent following other treatment modalities and similarly excised. Mohs technique permitted precise, quantitative tumor assessment, obtained via a novel method utilizing three parameters: the number of surgical stages required for complete excision, the percentage increase between clinical preoperative tumor area and final postoperative defect area, and the presence of deep subcutaneous tissue invasion. Figures for the postradiation group were larger in all three categories, with the latter two revealing statistically significant differences versus the nonradiation group. This study gives strong, direct quantitative support to the clinical impression that BCC recurrent following radiotherapy is a uniquely aggressive, invasive subset of recurrent BCC. ",0
"Critical review of gangliosides and thyrotropin-releasing hormone in peripheral neuromuscular diseases. The lack of effective therapy for many of the chronic neuromuscular diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, hereditary motor sensory neuropathy (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease), spinocerebellar degenerations and idiopathic polyneuropathy has led to a search for substances that may stimulate peripheral nerve regeneration. Two such agents that have been proposed are gangliosides (mixed purified bovine brain gangliosides, Cronassial) and thyrotropin releasing factor (TRH). Studies on both of these agents were initially reported with enthusiasm to be successful, but later double-blind controlled studies have failed to confirm these findings. This review provides critical analysis of the designs of studies of potentially effective agents in chronic neuromuscular diseases, and emphasizes the power of the placebo response, and the importance of designing placebos which are indistinguishable from the trial medication other than in the active effect.

"Sensitivity for detecting fibrillation potentials: a comparison between concentric and monopolar needle electrodes. The sensitivity of monopolar and concentric electrodes for detecting fibrillation potentials (FP) has never been formally compared. We studied 35 muscles with FP, sampling 20 sites each with concentric and monopolar needles. The concentric needle identified 0.88 +/- 3.44 (mean +/- standard deviation) more sites with spontaneous activity. Although statistically significant (Wilcoxon signed rank test P less than .03), this difference in sensitivity did not appreciably affect diagnostic interpretation. Subjects described the concentric needles as more painful. Needle insertions in 25 other muscles demonstrated that needle movement generated the majority of FP. We suggest that the increased tissue injury caused by concentric needles may account for both their increased sensitivity and discomfort. ",0
"Scrotal inflammatory disease: color Doppler US findings. A study of 45 patients with 51 cases of hemiscrotal inflammatory disease was done to determine the color Doppler ultrasonographic appearance of scrotal inflammatory disorders. The diagnosis was ultimately established by means of appropriate response to antibiotic treatment (47 cases) or surgery (four cases). In all cases, there was evidence of hyperemia: an increased number and concentration of detectable vessels in the affected portion of the scrotum. In 17 cases, the gray scale images were normal, and the only evidence of inflammation was the presence of hypervascularity. Abnormally decreased epididymal vascular resistance was detected in 14 cases of epididymitis; abnormally decreased testicular vascular resistance was detected in six cases of orchitis. Spontaneous venous flow was present in 18 patients. The authors conclude that color Doppler can demonstrate the hyperemic response to scrotal inflammatory disease and that, in the proper clinical setting, it can supplement the gray scale findings and increase diagnostic confidence.

"Multiple cranial nerve deficits after ethylene glycol poisoning. We report the cases of two patients who developed cranial nerve palsies after drinking ethylene glycol. A 33-year-old man developed multiple cranial nerve deficits nine days after the ingestion of ethylene glycol in a suicide attempt. Clinical findings included profound bilateral cranial nerve VII palsies and severe dysfunction of cranial nerves IX and X. The neuropathy occurred despite treatment with hemodialysis. The dysphagia completely cleared within two weeks, but at six months a severe bilateral cranial nerve VII dysfunction persisted. A 22-year-old man undergoing hemodialysis for ethylene glycol-induced renal failure developed bilateral cranial nerve VII dysfunction 14 days after ingestion. At a three-month follow-up, the patient demonstrated only moderate functional recovery. The etiology of the cranial nerve deficits is unknown but may be related to oxalate crystal deposition of ethylene glycol-induced pyridoxine dysfunction. ",0
"Manometric evaluation of jejunal limb after total gastrectomy and Roux-Orr anastomosis for gastric cancer. Total gastrectomy with Roux-Orr anastomosis is frequently performed for gastric cancer. Since intestinal motility of the Roux limb has never been evaluated after this operation, pressure activity was investigated in the Roux limb of ten patients (aged 51-77 years) who had undergone total gastrectomy and Roux-Orr reconstruction. Investigations were carried out during a 6-h fast and 3 h after a 605 kcal mixed meal. During fasting only two patients had activity fronts and these were abnormal. All ten patients displayed non-propagating bursts of contractions and three had discrete clustered contractions and high amplitude jejunal contractions. The fed state was characterized by a severely reduced motor activity pattern and other abnormalities. Total gastrectomy with Roux-Orr anastomoses provokes a relatively severe disturbance in intestinal activity. ",0
"Death by smothering and its investigation. This case report provides details from an extensive death investigation, the results of which led to the certification of suicidal manner of death by means of smothering in a pillow, without additional assistance from other persons or mechanical devices. This was the death of a chronically mentally ill person who was under currently approved professional treatment. Major investigative aspects of this case were the death-scene observations of the body, elimination of the possibility of homicide, and the study and analysis of the subject's psychiatric illness. Reasons for the uncommonness of reported deaths in this category are discussed. ",0
"Infertility and eating disorders. Sixty-six consecutive infertility clinic patients were prospectively screened with the 26-item Eating Attitudes Test and a study questionnaire. Women identified as being at high risk for an eating disorder were then interviewed to confirm or refute the diagnosis. A total of 7.6% of infertility clinic women were found to suffer from anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. If eating disorders not otherwise specified were included, a total of 16.7% of infertility patients were found to suffer from an eating disorder. Among infertile women with amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea 58% had eating disorders. Because women often fail to disclose eating disorders to their gynecologists and may appear to be of normal weight, it is recommended that a nutritional and eating disorder history be taken in infertility patients, particularly those with menstrual abnormalities. It has previously been shown that disorder eating and nutrition can affect menstruation, fertility, maternal weight gain, and fetal well-being. ",0
"Intrahepatic lymphatics opacified during hepatic arteriography in a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma. Extrahepatic lymph node metastases are not uncommon in advanced cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This is the account of a HCC case in which intrahepatic lymphatics running toward the hepatic hilus were clearly opacified during hepatic arteriography. The patient was treated by hepatic artery embolization followed by selective embolization of the portal branches, but lymph node metastases at the hepatic hilus were later found during follow-up. The clinical course of this case suggests that the communication between the tumor and the lymphatics was responsible for the lymph node metastasis. ",0
"Catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy in multiple endocrine neoplasia. A histologic, ultrastructural, and biochemical study. A catecholamine-induced dilated cardiomyopathy is reported in a patient with multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 3. A histologic and ultrastructural study has been undertaken in cardiac biopsy samples, together with determination of myocardial Ca++ and cellular membrane fatty acids. Contraction band necrosis of cardiocytes with supercontraction of sarcomeres progressing to myofibrolysis and increased levels of myocardial Ca++ have been found as morphologic and biochemical abnormalities, respectively. No lipoperoxidation of cellular membranes or an alpha-adrenergic mediated reduction of coronary supply could be recognized in the study. We indicate a receptor-mediated intracellular Ca++ overload as the main abnormality responsible for myocardial impairment. ",0
"Chronic rupture of the Achilles tendon: a new technique of repair. A new operative technique is described for the treatment of patients who have a rupture of the Achilles tendon. The large gap between the proximal and distal stumps of the Achilles tendon in seven patients was bridged by use of the tendon of the flexor digitorum longus as the graft. At the most recent follow-up examination (average follow-up, thirty-nine months; range, two to six years), the result was excellent or good in six patients and fair in one. Postoperatively, two patients needed an adjuvant procedure: one, a local rotation flap and the other, a split-thickness skin graft. Both patients had excellent restoration of function. The patient who had a fair result had a persistent limp and residual discomfort. There were no re-ruptures. ",0
"Clinical judgments in pain management. From research reports published over the last 20 years, it appears that moderate to severe uncontrolled pain may be the norm for hospitalized patients despite recent advances in the management of pain. Research on the extent of under-management of pain and the factors associated with it is examined and summarized in this paper. Methodological imperfections of the research are identified. Several explanations for pain under-management have been proposed and these are reported. A clinical decision making model is also reviewed and it is suggested that this model could be applied to pain management problems. Further, it is suggested that this model may be very useful in developing educational interventions to improve health practitioners' clinical skills in pain management. ",0
"Incarceration of colonoscope in an inguinal hernia. ""Pulley"" technique of removal. Because of its relative safety, colonoscopy has become an accepted diagnostic and therapeutic procedure in the evaluation of patients with colorectal disorders. Many unusual complications of colonoscopy have been described, but only anecdotal reports of hernial incarceration have been published. We present a case of a right-sided hernial incarceration of the colonoscope that would not permit reduction of the hernia nor removal of the instrument by conventional means. The mechanism of incarceration, which dictates the size of hernia at risk for incarceration, is explained. The ""pulley"" technique, which was used to remove the instrument without surgical intervention, is described. ",0
"Doppler ultrasonography of malignant melanomas of the uvea. Doppler shifts were detected using duplex and color Doppler scanning in 41 of 42 patients with malignant melanomas of the uvea. Mean maximum tumor systolic velocity was 18.8 +/- 7.6 cm/s. Time-averaged maximum velocity in the tumor vessels was 12.3 +/- 5.3 cm/s. Maximum tumor velocity increased in four of eight tumors and was unchanged or had diminished in the other four 2 to 3 days after ruthenium plaque irradiation. Doppler shifts were undetectable in three tumors, markedly reduced in three tumors, and unchanged in one tumor 1 to 4 months after treatment. We detected minimal non-pulse-synchronized Doppler shifts in one of three tumors, and no shifts in the remaining two tumors 1 1/2 to 4 years after therapy. Color duplex scanning allowed a rapid overview of tumor vasculature and facilitated study of individual vessels. ",0
"Primary intramedullary nailing of open femoral shaft fractures. The cases of 60 patients with 63 open femoral fractures treated by primary reamed intramedullary nailing were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-two were classified as Type I open fractures, 26 as Type II and 15 as Type III open fractures by Gustilo's classification. All fractures were treated by wound debridement followed by immediate reamed intramedullary nailing. There were five early soft-tissue infections and three late deep infections. Of the late infections, only one was osteomyelitis (1.6%). There were three nonunions and seven malunions. All of the complications were dealt with effectively by standard methods. We concluded that primary reamed intramedullary nailing is an effective alternative for the treatment of Type I and II open femur fractures and for Type III open femur fractures associated with multiple trauma.

"Clinical results of axillobifemoral bypass using externally supported polytetrafluoroethylene Seventy-six axillobifemoral grafts with externally supported polytetrafluoroethylene prostheses were performed since 1983. The indications for operation were absolute (aortic sepsis) in 20 (26%) patients and relative (excessive operative risk or technical difficulty) in 56 (74%) patients. The life-table primary patency for these operations at 4 years follow-up (mean follow-up, 2 years, 4 months) was 85%. We conclude that the patency results achieved in this patient series are sufficiently satisfactory to warrant use of axillobifemoral grafts in an expanded number of patients with high operative risk and need for bypass of aortoiliac occlusive disease.

"Hypertension and acculturation in elderly Mexican Americans: results from 1982-84 Hispanic HANES. The purpose of our study was to describe the relationship between acculturation and hypertension in elderly Mexican Americans. Two age groups, 55-64 and 65-74, were examined from data provided in the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES). The prevalence of hypertension among subgroups of different acculturation was ascertained based on the modified Cuellar Acculturation Scale. Each age group was also stratified using the HHANES poverty index, with those above the index compared to those below. A stepwise logistic regression was performed among the variables of poverty, gender, age, and acculturation in relation to hypertension. The results indicate that acculturation and age are stronger predictors of hypertension than poverty in elderly Mexican Americans, with acculturation being a stronger predictor among those age 55-64. Factors related to acculturation may have a stronger influence on the prevalence of hypertension in older Mexican Americans than differences related to socioeconomic status. ",0
"Role of oxygen free radicals in ischemic and reperfused myocardium. In recent years there has been considerable interest concerning the role of oxygen radicals in myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury. The sequential univalent reduction of oxygen gives rise to very reactive intermediate products. Normally, the tissue concentration of these intermediate products of oxygen is limited and the aerobic myocardium survives because of the existence of a delicate balance between the generation of the various oxidants and the maintenance of the antioxidant defense mechanism. Several possible sources have been identified for the production of active oxygen species after ischemia and reperfusion and these sources may be mutually interactive. The ability of scavengers of oxygen free radicals, including vitamin E, to improve mechanical, mitochondrial, and sarcoplasmic reticulum function in animal models of ischemic-reperfusion injury also suggests that oxygen free radicals are partly responsible for myocardial damage in these models, although caution in the interpretation of these data is necessary.

"The human costs of cancer and the response of the National Cancer Program. The three foundations of the National Cancer Program are basic research, clinical trials (in prevention and treatment), and cancer centers. These foundations have supported a great deal of progress against cancer over the past 20 years. Nevertheless, a number of challenges remain, and continued progress will depend on the speed with which research advances can be translated into practical realities. Poverty is a risk factor for cancer incidence and mortality. Thus, a lack of access to the technologies generated by the National Cancer Program can be a force for bringing about differential burdens of cancer in underserved populations. ",0
"Femur fracture with limb shortening causing occlusion of a polytetrafluoroethylene femoral popliteal graft. Traumatic occlusion of lower extremity polytetrafluoroethylene arterial grafts is exceedingly rare. We report a patient who suffered a supracondylar femur fracture resulting in shortening of her right lower extremity with kinking and thrombosis of her above-knee polytetrafluoroethylene arterial graft. This is the first report in the English language of prosthetic graft occlusion as a result of traumatic limb shortening. The graft thrombus was successfully lysed by use of intraarterial urokinase, and the kink was repaired by graft resection and reanastomosis. The mechanism of injury and treatment are discussed. ",0
"Cardiac pathology in 470 consecutive forensic autopsies. Cardiovascular disease continues to be the single most common generic cause of sudden and unexpected deaths. Atherosclerotic coronary heart disease and acute myocardial infarction are the most prevalent forms of fatal cardiac disease observed at autopsy. Other cardiac lesions are frequently listed as causes of death, but the prevalence of such lesions as incidental findings in the general population is unknown. In this study, 470 consecutive forensic autopsies were evaluated for minor and major anomalies. The most frequently observed major congenital finding was floppy mitral valve (5%). Tunneled coronary arteries, considered minor congenital findings, were seen in 29%. Atherosclerotic coronary heart disease was the most common major acquired finding, observed in 16% of cases. Of the 470 hearts, only 8% were considered normal. ",0
"Natural death as viewed by the medical examiner: a review of 1000 consecutive autopsies of individuals dying of natural disease. A study of 1000 consecutive autopsies of individuals dying of natural disease was conducted. Cardiovascular disease was responsible for 60.9% of all deaths with coronary artery disease--not only the main cause of cardiovascular death but also the main cause of all natural deaths--accounting for 45.1% of such cases. Diseases of the central nervous and respiratory systems accounted for 8.7 and 8.6%, respectively, of the natural deaths. Seizure disorders and pneumonia were the main causes of death in these organ systems. There were 124 deaths of children less than one year in age, 91 of which were due to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). All of the SIDS deaths were in children less than 10 months old. ",0
"Malignant melanoma of the biliary tract: a case report. A 58-year-old man was seen with obstructive jaundice and discomfort in the upper abdomen. Computed tomographic and ultrasound examinations revealed a soft-tissue mass in the gallbladder. Cholecystectomy and choledochotomy revealed a soft black mass in the gallbladder and a second one in the intrapancreatic portion of the common bile duct. Each was diagnosed as malignant melanoma. Subsequently, a Whipple resection of the pancreas, duodenum, and distal bile duct revealed a melanoma circumferentially invading and obstructing the distal common duct. No lymph node or distant metastasis was identified. Repetitive searches for another primary site have been negative. The tumor apparently originated in the biliary tract. The patient remains almost well 2 years after diagnosis. ",0
"Bladder function in the mentally retarded. A group of 21 mentally retarded patients with severe, long-standing urinary symptoms underwent urodynamical investigation. The most common abnormalities were detrusor areflexia and detrusor hyper-reflexia. Of 11 patients treated surgically, 10 derived marked benefit. Drugs were successful in reducing micturition problems in 3/6 patients. Severely retarded patients with spastic quadriplegia are difficult to investigate and if this is associated with detrusor hyper-reflexia it is impossible to treat them in any way. Severely retarded patients with detrusor areflexia and infrequent voiding can benefit from bladder outlet surgery. Patients with moderate (especially mild) retardation can be investigated and treated in the same way as non-retarded people. ",0
"Immunophenotyping in the management of gastric lymphoma. Primary gastric lymphoma is a rare tumor in which surgical resection plays a major role in improving the response rate and reducing the incidence of bleeding and perforation after chemotherapy. In 17 consecutive patients, the diagnosis of gastric lymphoma was made by immunophenotyping snap-frozen endoscopic biopsy specimens. All neoplasms were B-cell lymphomas. Pan B surface marker antigens were present in all patients. Levels of Ki-67, a nuclear marker of tumor proliferation, were greater than 45% in two of the four patients who died after progression of their lymphoma. All patients alive had Ki-67 levels of less than 30%. A lower proliferation index, as measured by Ki-67, appears to be associated with better prognosis. Ten of 11 patients treated by resection prior to chemotherapy had no complications. Immunophenotyping is the key in the differential diagnosis when considering malignant lymphoma with gastric carcinoma and benign conditions such as pseudolymphoma. ",0
"Dapsone is an effective therapy for the skin lesions of subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus and urticarial vasculitis in a patient with C2 deficiency. The deficiency of second component of complement (C2d) is the most common hereditary complement deficiency. Patients with C2 deficiency are frequently associated with an auto-immune disease process, in particular, systemic lupus erythematosus (LE)-like syndrome and/or vasculitic syndrome or bacterial infections. C2d has been associated with the LE subset of subacute cutaneous LE (SCLE), the presence of anti-Ro (SSA) antibodies, and the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types A10, B18, DR2. We describe the clinical, serologic and immunogenetic data in a patient with manifestations of Sjogren's syndrome who developed urticarial vasculitis and photosensitive annular SCLE which were effectively treated with oral dapsone. Our case illustrates the dynamic nature of LE. ",0
"Gastric lesions secondary to long-distance running. Gastrointestinal disorders have been reported during long-distance running. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of prolonged exercise on the upper digestive tract. Seven subjects were submitted to a standard endoscopic examination of the upper digestive tract before and after long-distance running (range 18-50 km). Mucosal biopsy specimens were taken during all endoscopies. After running, all runners had histologically pathological features in the stomach. Vascular lesions were present in the chorion in six subjects after running, with the intensity of the lesions ranging from congestion to hemorrhage. Postexercise histological examination also showed a decrease in mucosal secretion. These lesions secondary to prolonged exercise indicate the presence of hemodynamic perturbations in the upper digestive tract. ",0
"Neuroendocrine carcinoid tumours of the breast: a variant of carcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation. Carcinoid tumours most frequently develop in the gastrointestinal tract but have been described in many organs of the body. In 1977 the first cases were reported in the mamma, followed by descriptions of argyrophilic carcinoid-like, neuroendocrine mammary tumours by many investigators who performed immunohistochemical and ultrastructural examinations. The existence of true carcinoids in the mamma is still a controversial issue. Eight mammary neoplasms with monomorphous cytonuclear features, five of the small cell carcinoid-like variety and three composed of larger cells, were examined by immunohistochemical and ultrastructural examination. We believe this kind of tumours are ductal or lobular carcinomas with focal or more extensive neuroendocrine features and are the result of a dual differentiation of neoplastic precursor stem cells along epithelial and endocrine lines. Consequently, we consider that treatment of such cases should not be different from that of the ordinary type of mammary carcinomas. ",0
"The risk of large bowel cancer after partial gastrectomy for benign ulcer disease. The relative risk (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] for colorectal cancer after partial gastrectomy for ulcer disease was examined in a population-based cohort comprising 6459 patients operated during 1950 to 1958. Follow-up through 1983 revealed 131 cases of colorectal cancer versus 150.3 expected cases (SIR = 0.87; 95% confidence limits 0.73, 1.03). The relative risk was decreased during the first 19 years of follow-up (SIR = 0.75; 0.58, 0.96) and close to equal thereafter (SIR = 1.02; 0.79, 1.29). Sex, age at operation, type of operation, and diagnosis at operation (stomach or duodenal ulcer) did not affect the relative risk significantly. Confounding by socioeconomic status is one conceivable explanation for the decreased relative risk during the first years of follow-up, whereas the increasing risk with longer duration of follow-up might be a consequence of the surgical procedure itself.

"Cardiac arrest during hip arthroplasty with a cemented long-stem component. A report of seven cases. Seven patients had a cardiac arrest during hip arthroplasty with a cemented long-stem femoral component. Four patients died in the operating room, and three patients were successfully resuscitated. When the three survivors were eventually discharged from the hospital, they had no known permanent cardiac, pulmonary, or neurological sequelae. Factors that were common to all of the patients were advanced age, osteoporotic bone, a previously undisturbed intramedullary canal, and use of a long-stem femoral component and several batches of methylmethacrylate. Hip arthroplasty with a long-stem femoral component is associated with substantial risk in these patients. Excessive pressurization of cement should be avoided, and invasive hemodynamic monitoring should be used when the described conditions are present. ",0
"Early magnetic resonance imaging in acute traumatic internuclear ophthalmoplegia. Adduction deficiency following acute head trauma may result not only from orbital damage but also from internuclear ophthalmoplegia, and in most instances this resolves over weeks to months. To date, noninvasive imaging studies during the acute phase following injury have not been definitive in localizing the pathology. Three cases of adduction deficiency following head trauma that were caused by internuclear ophthalmoplegia are reported. A lesion in the brain stem was found in all three cases by magnetic resonance imaging in the subacute post-traumatic period. These lesions were not visible on routine x-ray computed tomography obtained at the time of injury. ",0
"A study of the comparative efficacy of four common analgesics in the control of postsurgical dental pain. Four common oral analgesics were tested in a single-blind trial to determine their relative efficacy in the management of postsurgical pain in 103 patients who had their impacted third molars surgically removed under general anesthesia. The analgesics tested were acetylsalicylic acid (26 patients), ibuprofen (26 patients), a paracetamol/codeine/caffeine combination (Solpadeine) (25 patients), and dihydrocodeine (26 patients). The paracetamol/codeine/caffeine combination, ibuprofen, and acetylsalicylic acid preparations produced equally effective analgesia. Dihydrocodeine was found to be a poor analgesic in this pain model. There were no adverse reactions to any of the preparations. ",0
"Partial duplication of the face: case report and review. Complete or partial facial duplication is a rare congenital malformation. A spectrum of structural abnormalities varying in degrees of severity has been described in affected individuals. We present discordance for facial duplication between monozygotic twins in which maxillary and mandibular duplication was present in one. The involved twin showed the following findings: ocular hypertelorism, bifidity of the nose, duplication of the maxilla, macrostomia, cleft of the lower lip, hamartoma of the vomer, supernumerary teeth, duplication of the mandibular teeth, bifidity of the tongue, and hamartoma of the floor of the mouth. Surgical management of the facial anomalies is discussed. A review of the literature and discussion of this rare malformation are presented. ",0
"Tryptophan-induced eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome Eight patients who became ill while taking tryptophan had myalgia, fatigue, rash, fever, edema, alopecia, arthralgias, diminished joint motion, skin tightening, muscle cramping, and distal paresthesias. Three had shortness of breath, and one had pulmonary hypertension. Laboratory abnormalities included peripheral eosinophilia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and elevated serum levels of aldolase, lactate dehydrogenase, and liver enzymes. Of 4 chest radiographs, 3 were abnormal. Of 5 skin and muscle biopsies, 4 showed sclerosis or mixed inflammatory cell infiltration of the dermis, subcutis, and fascia. Eosinophils were often present, but vasculitis was absent. Muscle inflammation was minimal. We conclude that the ""eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome"" is related to the ingestion of tryptophan and that abnormalities in the secretion of lymphokines may be important in its pathogenesis. ",0
"Amiloride blocks the onset of ACTH-induced hypertension in the sheep. This study investigated the ability of two diuretics, amiloride and frusemide, to prevent the development of ACTH induced hypertension in conscious sheep. Infusion of amiloride (20 mg/day) or frusemide (50 mg/day) for three days into normotensive sheep did not have any significant effects on blood pressure. Amiloride blocked ACTH-induced hypertension and the sodium retention and hypokalemia which is usually associated with ACTH administration. Frusemide failed to completely block the hypertension and potassium loss, however it blocked the transient initial urinary sodium retention associated with ACTH-induced hypertension. As frusemide failed to completely block the hypertension it is unlikely that the amiloride effect is due primarily to effects on urinary Na excretion. It is possible that amiloride is exerting its antihypertensive effects by blocking sodium channels. ",0
"Imaging the fetal brain in the second and third trimesters using transvaginal sonography. High-frequency transvaginal probes were used at 20-40 weeks' gestation to develop a systematic examination of the fetal brain. Modeling the procedure after the standard neonatal neurosonographic examination, we attempted to obtain three coronal sections (anterior, midline, posterior) and two sagittal sections (midsagittal, right or left parasagittal). In 70 normal patients, all planes were imaged with a similar frequency (74-76%) except for the posterior coronal plane, which was imaged 59% of the time. Among the first 35 cases, 17% had a complete study, compared with 71% of the second 35 cases. Transvaginal sonography established or changed the diagnosis in five of the 13 cases with central nervous system or other abnormalities. We recommend that a complete fetal neurosonographic examination include transvaginal sonography to complement and enhance the transabdominal examination, especially for cases in which a fetal abnormality is suspected.

"Tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesions of the head and neck. The term 'tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesion' has been used to describe a fibrosclerosing disorder which has a locally destructive nature but is characterized by a benign histological appearance. We report five patients, over a five year period, with such a lesion. The clinical behaviour and surgical findings suggest the lesion to be an invasive malignancy. However, the histological appearance of an admixture of chronic inflammatory cells and fibrosis is consistent with a benign condition. We recommend surgical excision of the lesion as the mainstay of treatment; other studies report the use of steroids and radiotherapy. ",0
"Isolated lung transplantation for pulmonary fibrosis. The peri-operative anaesthetic management of 11 patients with pulmonary fibrosis undergoing single-lung transplantation is presented. Intra-operative problems, the early postoperative phase of recovery and intensive care, and other incidents in which general anaesthesia was required for the management of complications, are featured. Results, both short- and long-term, are mentioned. Major intra-operative events that cause concern appear to be related to the severity of the presenting illness and the development of respiratory failure. Others have reported the development of intra-operative cardiac failure. All cases were successfully managed operatively using conventional one-lung anaesthesia, although resort to partial cardiopulmonary bypass may have been indicated in some. The indications and attitudes to utilising cardiopulmonary bypass in the evolution of techniques for facilitating single-lung transplantation are reviewed. ",0
"Empiric treatment of fungal infections in the neutropenic host. Review of the literature and guidelines for use. Persistent fever that is refractory to broad-spectrum antibacterials is common in neutropenic patients undergoing induction chemotherapy of acute leukemia. Clinical experience suggests that many of these patients are infected with fungi. Until recently, data supporting the role of empiric antifungal therapy in this setting were limited to small groups of patients or postmortem reports. Evolving evidence in larger patient populations supports data from smaller series: febrile neutropenic patients who have failed to respond to a 4- to 7-day course of broad-spectrum antibacterials may benefit from the early initiation of antifungal therapy. Patients with fungal colonization or pulmonary infiltrates and adult patients who have not received previous fungal prophylaxis may especially benefit from the early use of antifungal drugs. Amphotericin B has been the ""gold standard"" for empiric antifungal therapy, although the newer azoles may be useful in certain situations. ",0
"Association of Treacher Collins syndrome and translocation 6p21.31/16p13.11: exclusion of the locus from these candidate regions. Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS) is an autosomal dominant defect of craniofacial development which has not been chromosomally localized. We have identified a mother and two children who have TCS and also a balanced translocation t(6;16)(p21.31;p13.11), which suggested the possibility that the TCS locus might be located at one of the translocation breakpoints. These were defined by in-situ hybridization as 6p21.31 (by using loci in the HLA complex defined by the probes p45.1DP beta 003/HLA-DPB2 and pRS5.10/HLA class I chain) and 16p13.11 (by using probes pACHF1.3.2/D16S8 and VK45/D16S131). Pairwise and multipoint linkage analysis using localized chromosome 6 probes and chromosome 16 probes in 12 unrelated TCS families with multiple affected siblings excluded the TCS locus from proximity to both translocation breakpoints. These data were confirmed when a third affected child, who did not exhibit the translocation, was born to the mother. ",0
"The role of antihistamine therapy in vascular headaches. Migraine (vascular) headache is a complex syndrome that involves vascular hyperreactivity. The functions of systemic mediators in migraine are not fully understood. It is unclear which mediators provoke this probably atopic disorder and which represent an attempt to correct an imbalance. However, it has been demonstrated fairly conclusively that increased histamine levels correlate with migraine attacks in susceptible persons. Recent studies showing that histamine seems to have many different receptors and to adopt different conformations for different receptors may serve as a useful guide to future scientific investigation. Further impetus may come from ongoing studies of H3 histamine receptors, which indicate that H3 agonists offer promise as prophylactic agents for people who suffer from vascular headaches. ",0
"The value of push-type jejunal endoscopy in familial adenomatosis coli/Gardner's syndrome. Push-type jejunal endoscopy using a long forward-viewing duodenofiberscope was performed in 10 patients with familial adenomatosis coli/Gardner's syndrome. Jejunal polypoid lesions were detected in nine of the 10 patients (90%). The lesions appeared sessile, whitish, and measured 3 mm or less in diameter. Histologic findings of the biopsy specimens from these polypoid lesions revealed tubular adenoma in all nine patients. In addition, this method led to the detection of duodenal adenomas in one patient, in whom duodenofiberscopy with the side-viewing instrument revealed no polypoid lesions in the bulb and second portion of the duodenum. In view of these results, we recommend that push-type jejunal endoscopy, as well as side-viewing duodenofiberscopy, should be added to the usual preoperative examinations done in patients with this disease.

"Uniparental paternal disomy in Angelman's syndrome. Angelman's syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome are both causes of mental retardation with recognisable, but quite different, clinical phenotypes. Both are associated with deletions of chromosome 15q11-13, of maternal origin in Angelman's and paternal in Prader-Willi. Prader-Willi can arise by inheritance of two chromosomes 15 from the mother and none from the father (uniparental maternal disomy). In 2 patients with Angelman's syndrome we found evidence of uniparental paternal disomy. The phenotypic effects of maternal and paternal disomy of chromosome 15 are very different and inheritance of two normal 15s from one parent does not lead to normal development--strong evidence in man for genomic imprinting, in which the same gene has different effects dependent upon its parental origin.

"Primary orchiectomy versus estrogen therapy in advanced prostatic cancer--a randomized study: results after 7 to 10 years of followup. Of 163 new consecutively diagnosed cases of advanced (T3-4 M0 or T04M1) prostatic cancer 13 had contraindications for estrogen treatment, and the remainder were randomized to orchiectomy (76) or to estrogen treatment (74), consisting of 150 micrograms ethinyl estradiol daily and 80 mg. polyestradiol monthly. During the followup period of 7 to 10 years disease progression was noted in 27 patients (36%) treated with estrogen and 39 (51%) orchiectomized patients. The free of progression survival rate was significantly better (less than 0.05) among the estrogen treated patients but the over-all survival rates after orchiectomy and estrogen treatment were almost identical. A significantly higher frequency of cardiovascular side effects was noted in the estrogen group (23 cases) compared to the orchiectomy group (4 cases). Therefore, estrogen treatment in this form cannot be recommended for the palliative treatment of prostate cancer. ",0
"CD34 antigen expression in children with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. One characteristic of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph')-positive acute leukemia is the occasional presence of both lymphoid and myeloid features in the same leukemia. This phenomenon supports the theory that this subtype of acute leukemia arises from lymphoid-myeloid stem cell, pluripotent progenitors. Very few reports, however, describe the immunophenotype, especially CD34 antigen, of Ph'-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). It has been shown that CD34, the human progenitor cell antigen, is found on 1% or less of normal human bone marrow cells, approximately 30% of acute leukemias, and multipotent progenitor cells; CD34 is not found on normal peripheral blood cells. A high frequency of CD34 expression was found in children with Ph'-positive ALL: CD34 was positive for all six patients tested, and one had an acute mixed-lineage leukemia. These findings suggest the involvement of a pluripotent stem cell in Ph'-positive ALL. ",0
"Transient entrapment neuropathy of the posterior interosseous nerve in violin players. Eleven white male right handed violin players complained of transient muscular deficit of the extensor compartment of the left forearm during and after prolonged playing. This was associated with paraesthesiae and pain. Relief was achieved keeping the wrist and the elbow flexed, with the supinated forearm held by the contralateral hand. An anatomical study showed changes of the relationship of the posterior interosseous nerve with its surrounding structures with pronation and supination of the forearm. On the basis of the clinical features, the anatomical studies and the response to a simple physiotherapeutic regime, it is suggested that prolonged pronation of the forearm may cause transient entrapment of the nerve.

"Ondansetron: a new entity in emesis control. Nausea and vomiting are serious problems for patients receiving cancer chemotherapy. Dopamine receptor and cholinergic receptor antagonism have been the target mechanism for agents used to combat drug-induced nausea and vomiting; more recently, blockade of serotonin receptors has been used for this indication. Current therapies are limited by extrapyramidal adverse effects, as well as drowsiness, sedation, respiratory depression, and cardiac effects. Ondansetron is an investigational serotonin antagonist that has documented effectiveness for cancer chemotherapy-induced emesis. Ondansetron appears to be well tolerated, with the possible exception of headaches and transient increases in liver enzymes. No extrapyramidal toxicities have been reported with this agent. While ondansetron looks promising, further studies are needed to fully define its role as an antiemetic. ",0
"Protective role of vitamin E in biological systems. Vitamin E is well accepted as nature's most effective lipid-soluble, chain-breaking antioxidant, protecting cell membranes from peroxidative damage. Free-radical-mediated pathology has been implicated in the development over time of degenerative diseases and conditions. This paper reviews the current research on the protective role and requirements for vitamin E and the other antioxidants in preventing or minimizing free-radical damage associated with specific diseases and lifestyle patterns and processes, including cancer, aging, circulatory conditions, arthritis, cataract, pollution, and strenuous exercise. While awaiting results of further human studies, research evidence suggests that an adequate intake of vitamin E and the other antioxidants can provide protection from the increasingly high free-radical concentrations caused by air pollutants and current lifestyle patterns.

"Intravenous immunoglobulin treatment in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. Clinical and laboratory characteristics associated with improvement. Of 52 patients fulfilling the criteria of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, 20 (38%) did not improve after intravenous immunoglobulin treatment, two (4%) had a short-lasting improvement and subsequent infusions had no effect, nine (17%) reached a spontaneously or therapeutically induced complete remission, and 21 patients (40%) needed intermittent infusions to maintain improvement. All patients who improved initially had symptoms that significantly interfered with life-style. After treatment, 90% of these patients were independent in their daily activities. Significantly associated with improvement were disease duration of less than 1 year, progression of weakness until treatment, absence of discrepancy in weakness between arms and legs, areflexia of the arms, and slowed nerve conduction velocity of the motor median nerve. The probability of improvement if all these features are present in 93%. ",0
"Interventional radiologic alternatives to cholecystectomy. It has been estimated that 20 million people in the United States have gallstone disease. The choice of the optimal management strategy for a patient with symptomatic gallstones in the 1990s will take into account the clinical status of the patient, the characteristics of the gallstones, and the patient's preference. Only patients whose doctors understand the advantages and disadvantages of the newer methods can make properly informed choices. When interventional radiologic alternatives to cholecystectomy are being contemplated, one approach is to first consider the patient's clinical presentation (acute or nonacute) and then their risk of death after cholecystectomy (low or high). Figure 5 shows an algorithmic approach to the management of gallbladder stones based on this concept. This algorithm also can be used as a framework for discussion of treatment options with any individual patient. ",0
"Short-term memory and sentence comprehension. An investigation of a patient with crossed aphasia. The relationship between short-term memory impairment and sentence comprehension is explored in a right-handed patient with a focal temporoparietal lesion of the right hemisphere. The general clinical profile, as well as characteristics of the patient's immediate memory for word lists, suggests the occurrence of a 'mirror image' crossed aphasia. Detailed analysis of the patient's ability to repeat and to comprehend sentences, however, indicates some important differences between this case and previously reported patients with short-term memory impairment. It is suggested that these differences, which may be related to an unusual pattern of neuroanatomical organization of cognitive functions, involve symptom dissociations with implications for models of normal language/memory interactions.

"Primary osteosarcoma of the lung. Report of two cases and review of the literature. Two cases of primary osteosarcoma of the lung are presented. In one case, the radiologic, clinical, and cytologic findings led to a preoperative diagnosis of undifferentiated carcinoma of the lung. In the second case, a lung nodule was discovered during postchemotherapy follow-up in a patient with lymphoma. Fine needle aspiration in the second case showed lymphoma, and further chemotherapy was instituted; however, persistent growth of the nodule prompted a resection. Microscopic examination of the resected tumors in both cases revealed histologic features of high-grade osteosarcoma. Flow cytometric analyses of the primary tumors showed abnormal hyperdiploid deoxyribonucleic acid populations in accordance with those seen in high-grade malignant neoplasms. Immunohistochemical studies supported a mesenchymal origin for these tumors. These tumors shared clinical features with other reported cases of primary osteosarcoma of the lung such as large size at diagnosis, occurrence in older individuals, and aggressive behavior. ",0
"Diphenylhydantoin-induced hypogammaglobulinemia in a patient infected with human immunodeficiency virus. A case is reported of reversible panhypogammaglobulinemia in a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patient. Onset and resolution were temporally correlated with initiation and termination, respectively, of diphenylhydantoin therapy for a possible seizure. A rapid alteration in peripheral T-cell subpopulations was also noted in association with diphenylhydantoin administration. This case is compared with previous reports of diphenylhydantoin-associated hypogammaglobulinemia in non-HIV-infected patients. In addition, the case is discussed with regard to possible deleterious effects associated with the use of diphenylhydantoin as therapy for HIV-associated seizures or as an antiretroviral agent in HIV disease.

"Pelvic pain: lessons from anatomy and physiology. Pelvic pain is often a difficult differential diagnosis in the emergency department. For physiologic reasons, pain in the pelvis is difficult to localize to a specific organ, and pelvic peritonitis is hard to recognize. On the other hand, differences in types of pain can be very useful in arriving at a correct diagnosis. The clinician must learn to recognize superficial and deep somatic pain, and differentiate between various types of visceral pain which originate from inflammation, ischemia, or colic. A review of the anatomy and physiology of pelvic pain helps identify some of the problems as well as potential aids in approaching the patient with pelvic pain. ",0
"Dietary management of acute childhood diarrhea: optimal timing of feeding and appropriate use of milks and mixed diets. Several recent clinical trials have examined the optimal timing of feeding and the appropriate foods for use in the dietary management of acute childhood diarrhea. Important methodologic issues relevant to these trials, such as the composition and masking of study diets, measurement of outcome variables, and assessment of nutritional status, are discussed. Available data suggest that feeding should be continued during diarrhea, although a small subgroup of patients receiving nonhuman milk exclusively may have an excess rate of complications. These children should be closely supervised or provided with alternative diets. By contrast, children receiving human milk, nonmilk formulas, and mixed diets are generally able to tolerate these foods and to benefit nutritionally from continued feeding. ",0
Small bowel phytobezoar mimicking presentation of Crohn's disease. A case of small bowel phytobezoar formed from unusual ingested vegetation is described. The patient presented with recurrent subacute obstruction and a right iliac fossa mass mimicking the presentation of Crohn's disease. None of the usual gastrointestinal disorders that predispose to bezoar formation were present. The phytobezoar passed spontaneously following small bowel enema and colonoscopy. It is possible that relaxation of the gut secondary to the antispasmodics administered at investigation or the physical disturbance during these procedures enabled migration through the ileocecal valve. Antispasmodics may be of use in the conservative management of bezoars obstructing otherwise normal bowel. ,0
"Child care practices with respect to acute respiratory tract infection in a poor, urban community in Nigeria. A longitudinal study conducted over a 3-year period in a poor, urban community in Nigeria, a developing country, found that acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) was common, in particular among infants and boys. Between 81% and 95% of the children treated for ARI over the 3-year period were brought to the clinic by their mothers. About 32% of these children had been treated with cough medicines, 42% with antipyretics, 5% with antibiotics, and 10% with hematinics before they were brought to the clinic. The source of such medications included medicines left over from previous prescriptions and those bought from chemists' shops and street vendors. Up to 64% of the children treated for ARI had been force-fed local herbal teas by their mothers; herbal teas were used for both preventive and curative purposes. ",0
"Pathogenesis of antigen-induced arthritis in mice deficient in neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G. The contribution of neutrophil-derived elastase and cathepsin G to joint pathology has been examined in immune arthritis in the mouse. Neutrophils from beige mice are genetically deficient in lysosomal elastase and cathepsin G, but have normal levels of the acid hydrolases, beta-glucuronidase, and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase. The development of antigen-induced arthritis in normal mice has been compared with that in beige mice. The pattern of synovitis (both leukocyte accumulation and plasma leakage) were indistinguishable in normal and beige mice. Cartilage proteoglycan depletion was quantified by measuring the decrease in safranin O staining intensity, and this, too, was unaltered in mice lacking elastase and cathepsin G. These results suggest that neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G do not contribute to these aspects of joint pathology in antigen-induced arthritis in the mouse. ",0
"Prospective payment system and impairment at discharge. The 'quicker-and-sicker' story revisited Since the introduction of the prospective payment system (PPS), anecdotal evidence has accumulated that patients are leaving the hospital ""quicker and sicker."" We developed valid measures of discharge impairment and measured these levels in a nationally representative sample of patients with one of five conditions prior to and following the PPS implementation. Instability at discharge (important clinical problems usually first occurring prior to discharge) predicted the likelihood of postdischarge deaths. At 90 days postdischarge, 16% of patients discharged unstable were dead vs 10% of patients discharged stable. After the PPS introduction, instability increased primarily among patients discharged home. Prior to the PPS, 10% of patients discharged home were unstable; after the PPS was implemented, 15% were discharged unstable, a 43% relative change. Efforts to monitor the effect of this increase in discharge instability on health should be implemented. ",0
"Flow cytometric DNA content of adenoid cystic carcinoma of submandibular gland. Correlation of histologic features and prognosis. Flow cytometric analysis of nuclear DNA content was performed in 26 adenoid cystic carcinomas of the submandibular gland using archived, paraffin-embedded tissues. The DNA content was compared with multiple histologic parameters and clinical course. Ten carcinomas (38%) were aneuploid and 16 (62%) diploid. Aneuploid carcinomas demonstrated a higher frequency of solid cytoarchitecture, lymph node metastases, and advanced clinical stage, as compared with diploid carcinomas. Other histologic features predicting aggressive clinical behavior also correlated with abnormal DNA content and included invasion of nerves larger than 0.25 mm and intravascular extension. Our data suggest that DNA content analysis can be an effective objective parameter in the clinicopathologic assessment of adenoid cystic carcinoma. ",0
"Compressive neuropathy of spinal nerve roots. A mechanical or biological problem? Pathophysiologically, nerve root pain production is a complex issue. For many years, mechanical compression has been regarded as the sole cause for such pain. There are indications, however, that other factors, such as intraneural inflammation, may be of importance in this context. In this article, four cases are presented in which nerve root related pain gradually resolved without any proven change in the mechanical deformation of the involved nerve root. The data presented here suggest that mechanical compression, per se, may not always be the sole cause of radicular pain and dysfunction. These findings suggest that improvement is needed in our understanding of the pathophysiology of nerve root compression and inflammation. ",0
"Prognostic significance of proteinuria one year after onset of diarrhea-associated hemolytic-uremic syndrome. We examined the prognostic value of changes in the amount of proteinuria, measured as protein/creatinine ratios in early-morning urine samples, in 40 children who had had diarrhea-associated hemolytic-uremic syndrome. One year after diagnosis, 87% of those who seemed to have fully recovered had normal urinary protein/creatinine ratios, compared with none of those with poor outcomes (p less than 0.001). None of those with poor outcomes achieved normal protein/creatinine ratios during follow-up to a maximum of 5 1/2 years, but 93% of those who made a full clinical recovery no longer had proteinuria. Measurement of the protein/creatinine ratio in an early-morning sample of urine is a simple, cost-effective, and noninvasive means of monitoring the progress of patients with diarrhea-associated hemolytic-uremic syndrome, provided that a technique sensitive at low protein concentrations is employed.

"Vaginal epithelial abnormalities in patients with CIN: clinical and pathological features and management. Of 4147 women who had CIN treated by laser at the Regional Gynaecological Oncology Centre, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Gateshead, 103 (2.5%) had co-existing vaginal epithelial abnormalities. CIN 3 was the histological diagnosis most often associated with vaginal lesions. The upper vagina was almost always involved. In 67% the lesion in the cervix appeared to be confluent with that in the vagina. Even when the lesions were confluent, biopsies form the cervical and vaginal components did not always show the same grade of intraepithelial neoplasia and in some biopsies they showed different lesions. Laser treatment appears to be effective for the vaginal lesions and is therefore recommended although, in selected patients, careful follow up alone may suffice. ",0
"Effect of exposure of miners to aluminium powder. 'McIntyre Powder' (finely ground aluminium and aluminium oxide) was used as a prophylactic agent against silicotic lung disease between 1944 and 1979 in mines in northern Ontario. To find out whether the practice produced neurotoxic effects a morbidity prevalence study was conducted between 1988 and 1989. There were no significant differences between exposed and non-exposed miners in reported diagnoses of neurological disorder; however, exposed miners performed less well than did unexposed workers on cognitive state examinations; also, the proportion of men with scores in the impaired range was greater in the exposed than non-exposed group. Likelihood of scores in the impaired range increased with duration of exposure. The findings are consistent with putative neurotoxicity of chronic aluminium exposure. ",0
"Analysis of alterations in the retinoblastoma gene and tumor grade in bone and soft-tissue sarcomas. The retinoblastoma (RB) gene plays a crucial role in the regulation of cell cycle progression, and its alterations have been implicated in the development and progression of various cancers. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between RB gene alterations and tumor grade in bone and soft-tissue sarcomas. Tumor samples from patients with bone and soft-tissue sarcomas were analyzed for RB gene alterations using various molecular techniques. The tumor grade was determined according to standard histopathological criteria. Our results showed a significant association between RB gene alterations and tumor grade in both bone and soft-tissue sarcomas. Specifically, a higher frequency of RB gene alterations was observed in high-grade tumors compared to low-grade tumors. Furthermore, the type and location of RB gene alterations varied between bone and soft-tissue sarcomas. These findings provide valuable insights into the molecular pathogenesis of bone and soft-tissue sarcomas and highlight the potential prognostic and therapeutic implications of RB gene alterations in these tumors.",1
"Bilateral sudden deafness and acute acquired toxoplasmosis. We present a case report of a 42-year-old female who presented with bilateral sudden deafness and was subsequently diagnosed with acute acquired toxoplasmosis. The patient experienced a sudden onset of complete hearing loss in both ears without any prior symptoms. Serological testing confirmed the presence of Toxoplasma gondii IgM antibodies, indicating an acute infection. Treatment with a combination of antiparasitic medication and corticosteroids resulted in partial recovery of hearing. This case highlights the importance of considering toxoplasmosis as a potential cause of sudden deafness, particularly in individuals with risk factors such as exposure to contaminated soil or uncooked meat. Early diagnosis and prompt initiation of appropriate treatment can improve the prognosis for hearing recovery in these patients.",1
"Mesial temporal sclerosis: pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management. Mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) is a common cause of epilepsy, characterized by selective neuronal loss and gliosis in the mesial temporal structures, particularly the hippocampus. The pathogenesis of MTS is multifactorial, involving genetic predisposition, early-life insults, and prolonged febrile seizures. Diagnosis of MTS relies on clinical history, neuroimaging findings, and electroencephalogram abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), especially high-resolution sequences, plays a crucial role in identifying hippocampal sclerosis and ruling out other causes of temporal lobe epilepsy. The management of MTS mainly focuses on controlling seizures through antiepileptic drugs. However, for drug-resistant cases, surgical options such as anterior temporal lobectomy or selective amygdalohippocampectomy can be considered. The long-term outcome of surgery in MTS patients is favorable, offering the possibility of seizure freedom and improved quality of life. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of MTS pathogenesis, accurate diagnosis, and appropriate treatment selection are essential for optimizing patient outcomes.",1
"Ischaemic heart disease among men in Norway during the period 1966-1985: two counties with different mortality time trends.  We have examined regional differences in mortality from ischaemic heart disease, including sudden, unexpected death (IHD/SUD), among Norwegian men aged 30-69 years, during the period 1966-1985. This study aims to investigate regional variations in mortality rates from ischaemic heart disease (IHD) among men in Norway from 1966 to 1985. Two counties with contrasting mortality time trends were examined. The study focused on men aged 30 to 69 years. IHD includes sudden and unexpected deaths (SUD). The results revealed noticeable differences in mortality rates between the two counties. County A experienced a steady decrease in IHD mortality, while County B experienced a fluctuating trend with periods of both increase and decrease. These regional disparities in mortality rates may be attributed to various factors, such as differences in risk factors, healthcare systems, lifestyle choices, and socio-economic circumstances. Further research is warranted to identify the underlying reasons for these variations and to develop targeted interventions for reducing IHD mortality.",1
"Small cell carcinoma of the pancreas and biliary tract. Small cell carcinoma (SCC) is a rare and aggressive subtype of pancreatic and biliary tract cancer. We report on four cases of SCC involving the pancreas (n=3) and biliary tract (n=1) diagnosed at our institution over a 2-year period. These cases, diagnosed based on histological and immunohistochemical characteristics, demonstrated typical small, round, and closely packed cells with high mitotic activity. Neuroendocrine markers, such as chromogranin and synaptophysin, were positive in all cases, confirming the neuroendocrine origin of the tumor. Despite aggressive multi-modal treatment including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, all patients experienced rapid disease progression and succumbed to the disease within months. Due to its rarity and aggressive nature, SCC of the pancreas and biliary tract poses unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms and develop effective treatment strategies for this aggressive malignancy.",1
"Central odontogenic fibroma: clinicopathologic features of 19 cases and review of the literature.  The odontogenic fibroma is a benign neoplasm infrequently reported in the literature (20 cases). We present a study of 19 cases of central odontogenic fibroma (COF) along with a comprehensive review of the literature, which currently comprises 20 reported cases. COF is a rare benign neoplasm of odontogenic origin that primarily affects the mandible and maxilla. The mean age of the patients in our series was 42 years, with a slight female predilection. The most common clinical manifestation was painless swelling, often associated with tooth displacement or mobility. Radiographically, most cases exhibited a well-defined radiolucent lesion with varying degrees of calcifications. Microscopically, the tumors exhibited a fibroblastic cell population embedded in a collagenous stroma, with islands or strands of odontogenic epithelium scattered throughout. The treatment of choice for COF is conservative surgical enucleation or curettage, with low recurrence rates reported. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of this rare entity and highlight the importance of accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.",1
"Prevention of renal disease and conservation of renal function. Renal disease is a significant health burden, and its prevention and preservation of renal function are crucial. Various strategies can be employed to achieve these goals. Firstly, controlling modifiable risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity is paramount. Additionally, regular screening for renal disease and early detection of renal dysfunction allow for timely intervention and management. In patients with chronic kidney disease, optimizing blood pressure control, glycemic control, and proteinuria reduction can slow disease progression. Implementing lifestyle modifications, including a healthy diet, regular exercise, and smoking cessation, also contribute to preventing renal disease. Furthermore, medications such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors have shown favorable outcomes in preserving renal function. Overall, a comprehensive approach addressing risk factors, regular monitoring, and appropriate interventions can effectively prevent renal disease and conserve renal function.",1
"Testicular calcifications and neoplasia in patient treated for subfertility. We report a case of testicular calcifications and neoplasia in a 40-year-old male who was previously treated for subfertility. The patient presented with testicular pain and a palpable lump. Ultrasound examination revealed multiple calcifications within the testicles and a solid mass. Testicular biopsy confirmed the presence of a seminoma. The patient underwent orchiectomy and further histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of stage I seminoma. The presence of testicular calcifications is an uncommon finding, and their association with neoplasia is rare. This case emphasizes the importance of considering testicular calcifications as a potential marker for malignancy, especially in individuals with a history of reproductive issues. Further research is needed to fully understand the pathophysiology and implications of testicular calcifications in relation to neoplasia.",1
"Inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms.  In a series of 517 operations for abdominal aortic aneurysm from 1971 to 1988 there were 45 cases (8. In this study, we present the findings of 45 cases of inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms (IAAA) out of a total of 517 operations for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) performed between 1971 and 1988. IAAA is a rare and distinct subtype of AAA characterized by the presence of an inflammatory infiltrate within the aneurysm wall. The clinical presentation and outcomes of IAAA differ from those of non-inflammatory AAA. Our results indicate that IAAA is more common in men than in women, with a mean age of 67 years at presentation. Patients with IAAA often have comorbidities such as hypertension and smoking history. Surgical repair is the primary treatment option, with perioperative mortality rates comparable to non-inflammatory AAA repair. However, long-term outcomes of IAAA repair show higher rates of late mortality and postoperative complications, emphasizing the need for careful follow-up and management of these patients. Further research is warranted to understand the underlying mechanisms and optimal management strategies for IAAA.",1
"Lugol stain for intraoperative determination of the proximal surgical margin of the esophagus. In this study, the effect of auxiliary heterotopic liver transplantation on portal hypertension and hypersplenism was evaluated in eight patients with chronic liver disease. The patients had functional grafts for a minimum of 6 months. The results showed that the transplantation led to normalization of platelet and leukocyte counts, a 20% reduction in splenomegaly (P < 0.02), disappearance of ascites, and a decrease in esophageal varices in all patients. During the operation, there was a 54% reduction in the mean portacaval pressure gradient after graft recirculation (P < 0.05). These findings indicate that a functioning auxiliary heterotopic liver graft can effectively decompress portal hypertension and reverse hypersplenism. Additionally, the use of Lugol stain for intraoperative determination of the proximal surgical margin of the esophagus was described.",1
"Clinical judgments in pain management. Pain management is a critical aspect of patient care, requiring accurate assessment and appropriate intervention. However, clinical judgments regarding pain management can vary among healthcare providers, leading to inconsistent treatment approaches. This study aimed to investigate the factors influencing clinical judgments in pain management and explore potential strategies to enhance decision-making processes. A systematic review of relevant literature was conducted, and 30 studies were included for analysis. The findings revealed that healthcare providers' clinical judgments were influenced by various factors, including personal beliefs, experience, knowledge, patient characteristics, and contextual factors. Moreover, decision aids, education and training programs, and interdisciplinary collaboration were identified as potential strategies to improve clinical judgments in pain management. These findings highlight the importance of considering multiple factors and implementing evidence-based approaches to ensure effective and consistent pain management practices. Further research is warranted to develop comprehensive guidelines and interventions to support healthcare providers in making informed clinical judgments in pain management.",1
"Germfree animals and technics in surgical research. The use of germfree animals in surgical research has been of great value in understanding the role of microorganisms in various surgical procedures.

This allows for the assessment of the impact of specific microorganisms on surgical outcomes. Various surgical techniques have also been developed to maintain the integrity of a germfree environment during procedures. These techniques include laminar flow operating rooms, sterile surgical attire, and specialized sterilization protocols for equipment and instruments. Germfree animals have been particularly useful in studying the effects of infections, wound healing, and the immune response to surgical interventions. Furthermore, they have provided insights into the pathogenesis of surgical site infections and the development of new strategies for infection prevention and control. Overall, the use of germfree animals and associated technics in surgical research has significantly contributed to improving patient outcomes and advancing surgical practices.",1
"Adverse treatment effects in the trial of the European Working Party on High Blood Pressure in the Elderly. The European Working Party on High Blood Pressure in the Elderly conducted a trial to evaluate the effects of antihypertensive treatment in older individuals. Adverse treatment effects were analyzed in a subset of participants from this trial. Among the 335 patients included in the analysis, 183 experienced adverse effects attributed to the antihypertensive medication. The most common adverse effects were orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, and fatigue. Adverse effects were more frequent in women and in those with higher systolic blood pressure at baseline. Importantly, these adverse effects did not result in higher rates of discontinuation of the antihypertensive treatment. These findings highlight the importance of monitoring for adverse effects and tailoring antihypertensive treatment to individual patient characteristics in the elderly population.",1
"Corpus callosotomy for intractable seizures in the pediatric age group. Corpus callosotomy is a surgical procedure commonly performed in the pediatric age group to manage intractable seizures. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the long-term outcomes of corpus callosotomy in this patient population. 

The study included a total of 78 patients who underwent corpus callosotomy for intractable seizures. The mean age at the time of surgery was 9.7 years, with a range of 3 to 17 years. Follow-up ranged from 5 to 10 years in all patients.

At the last follow-up, approximately 85.9% of patients experienced a reduction in seizure frequency, with 62.8% achieving complete seizure control. The remaining 14.1% of patients had no significant improvement or experienced worsened seizures.

Notably, 5.1% of patients experienced complications related to the surgery, including infection and cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Additionally, 3.8% of patients required repeat surgery due to persistent or recurring seizures.

In conclusion, corpus callosotomy appears to be an effective treatment option for intractable seizures in the pediatric age group, with a relatively low rate of complications. However, further studies are needed to better understand the long-term outcomes and potential risk factors associated with this procedure.",1
"Modified technique of Pringle's maneuver in resection of the liver. Pringle's maneuver, a technique used to control bleeding during liver resection, involves clamping the hepatic artery and portal vein. However, this technique can sometimes be challenging due to limitations in visualization and maneuverability. In a modified technique of Pringle's maneuver, a silicone tourniquet is placed around the hepatic artery and portal vein, allowing for continuous clamping without the need for manual compression. This modified technique was evaluated in a retrospective study of patients undergoing liver resection, and results showed that it was effective in controlling bleeding with minimal complications. The modified Pringle's maneuver offers a simpler and more effective option for achieving hemostasis during liver resection procedures.",1
"Prognostic factors in primary retroperitoneal soft-tissue sarcomas. Primary retroperitoneal soft-tissue sarcomas (PRTS) are rare tumors with a poor prognosis. This study aimed to identify prognostic factors associated with PRTS. A retrospective analysis of 96 patients with PRTS was conducted. The mean age of the patients was 53 years, and there was a slight female predominance. The most common histological subtype was liposarcoma (52.1%), followed by leiomyosarcoma (32.3%). The median tumor size was 15 cm. The 5-year overall survival rate was 42.1%. On multivariate analysis, tumor size (>10 cm), incomplete resection, high grade, and distant metastasis were identified as independent prognostic factors for poor overall survival. The presence of lymph node metastasis was not found to significantly affect survival. These findings suggest that tumor size, grade, completeness of resection, and presence of distant metastasis are important prognostic factors for patients with PRTS. Individualized treatment strategies, including aggressive surgical resection and systemic therapy, should be considered based on these factors to improve patient outcomes.",1

This study highlights the significant morbidity and mortality associated with TAAA surgery, emphasizing the need for careful patient selection and surgical techniques to optimize outcomes.",1
"Intracatheter streptokinase for recurrent peritonitis in CAPD. Peritonitis is a common complication in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Although conventional treatment with antibiotics has been successful in most cases, recurrent peritonitis remains a clinical challenge. The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intracatheter streptokinase (ISK) in the management of recurrent peritonitis in CAPD patients.

A retrospective analysis was conducted on CAPD patients who experienced at least two episodes of peritonitis within a six-month period. Patients were divided into two groups: the ISK group (n=20) received intracatheter streptokinase instillation, whereas the control group (n=20) received standard antibiotic treatment alone.

The primary outcome measure was the time to the next episode of peritonitis. Secondary outcome measures included the rate of peritonitis recurrence, hospitalization days, dialysis adequacy, and adverse events.

The ISK group showed a significantly longer interval to the next peritonitis episode compared to the control group (p<0.001). The recurrence rate of peritonitis was lower in the ISK group (30%) compared to the control group (70%). Hospitalization days were also significantly reduced in the ISK group (p<0.05).

No serious adverse events related to ISK instillation were observed.

Intracatheter streptokinase appears to be a safe and effective adjunctive therapy for the management of recurrent peritonitis in CAPD patients. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm these findings and optimize the dosage and duration of ISK administration.",1
"The value of indium 111 leukocyte scanning in the evaluation of painful or infected total knee arthroplasties.

The overall sensitivity of indium 111 leukocyte scanning in detecting infection in total knee arthroplasties was found to be 87.5%, with a specificity of 76.9%. These findings suggest that indium 111 leukocyte scanning is a valuable tool in the evaluation of painful or infected total knee arthroplasties.",1
"Ultrasound and ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy of supraclavicular lymph nodes in patients with esophageal carcinoma. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound (US) imaging and ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of supraclavicular lymph nodes (LN) in patients with esophageal carcinoma. A total of 50 patients with esophageal carcinoma and suspected supraclavicular LN involvement were included. All patients underwent US imaging and subsequent ultrasound-guided FNAB for cytological examination of the LN. The results were compared with the histopathological findings obtained from supraclavicular LN dissection during surgery. US imaging exhibited a sensitivity of 86.7%, specificity of 91.7%, positive predictive value of 92.9%, negative predictive value of 85.7%, and accuracy of 88% for the detection of metastatic LN involvement in patients with esophageal carcinoma. The ultrasound-guided FNAB showed a sensitivity of 89.5%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value of 100%, negative predictive value of 90.9%, and accuracy of 94% for cytological diagnosis of metastatic LN involvement. Therefore, US imaging and ultrasound-guided FNAB can be considered as valuable tools for preoperative evaluation of supraclavicular LN involvement in patients with esophageal carcinoma, allowing for appropriate treatment planning and management decisions.",1
"A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of oral antibiotic therapy following intravenous antibiotic therapy for postpartum endometritis. Postpartum endometritis is a common complication of childbirth, requiring intravenous antibiotic therapy. However, the optimal duration and route of antibiotic therapy remains uncertain. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of oral antibiotic therapy following intravenous antibiotic therapy in 250 women with postpartum endometritis. Women were randomly assigned to receive either oral antibiotics or placebo for an additional 7 days after completing intravenous therapy. The primary outcome measured was clinical cure rate at 14 days. Secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay, adverse events, and recurrence rate. Preliminary results indicate a similar clinical cure rate between the two groups, suggesting that oral antibiotic therapy following intravenous therapy may not provide additional benefit in the treatment of postpartum endometritis.",1
"Slowly progressive aphasia: three cases with language, memory, CT and PET data. We present three cases of slowly progressive aphasia characterized by a gradual decline in language abilities over a period of several years. Language assessments revealed a prominent impairment in word finding and sentence construction, along with a relative preservation of comprehension and reading skills. All patients exhibited memory deficits, with the severity varying across cases. Neuroimaging findings showed focal atrophy in different language-related regions, including the left temporal cortex and left frontal cortex. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans revealed hypometabolism in these same areas, consistent with the clinical presentation. These findings provide further evidence for the involvement of specific brain regions in the pathogenesis of slowly progressive aphasia. Early recognition and diagnosis of this condition are crucial, as it allows for appropriate management and counseling for patients and their families.",1
"Visual evoked potential monitoring of optic nerve function during surgery. Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) have been widely used for monitoring optic nerve function during surgery. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility and reliability of VEP monitoring in a cohort of 50 patients undergoing various types of surgery. VEP responses were recorded using scalp electrodes and analyzed for latency and amplitude changes. The results showed that VEP monitoring was feasible in all patients, with clear and stable waveforms obtained in 96% of cases. Changes in latency and amplitude were observed in 12% of patients, indicating potential optic nerve compromise. These changes were reversible in all cases, highlighting the importance of VEP monitoring in preventing permanent visual deficits. Overall, VEP monitoring proved to be a valuable tool for assessing optic nerve function during surgery and should be considered as a routine monitoring modality.",1
"Protein phosphorylation during ischemia.  Many investigations have shown that calcium and adenosine triphosphate are crucial to central nervous system functions. Protein phosphorylation is a crucial cellular process involved in the regulation of various physiological functions. This study aimed to investigate the role of protein phosphorylation during ischemia, a condition characterized by insufficient blood flow to tissues. Using animal models, the researchers examined the changes in protein phosphorylation patterns in the central nervous system during ischemia. Results demonstrated that ischemia significantly altered protein phosphorylation levels, particularly in key signaling pathways involved in neuronal survival and cell death. Furthermore, the study identified calcium and adenosine triphosphate as essential molecules regulating protein phosphorylation during ischemia. These findings highlight the importance of protein phosphorylation in neuronal function and suggest that targeting specific phosphorylation events may have therapeutic potential in the management of ischemic conditions. Further research is warranted to elucidate the precise mechanisms underlying protein phosphorylation during ischemia and explore potential interventions to mitigate its detrimental effects.",1

This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of surgical therapy for eyelid correction in patients with facial paralysis suffering from lagophthalmos and paralytic ectropion. A total of 45 patients were included in the analysis. Surgical interventions included tarsorrhaphy, lateral tarsal strip, and full-thickness blepharotomy. Postoperative outcomes were assessed in terms of improvement in eyelid position, reduction in corneal exposure, and patient satisfaction. Results showed that surgical correction led to significant improvement in eyelid position and reduction in corneal exposure in the majority of patients. Patient satisfaction rates were high, with 82% reporting improvement in their symptoms. Complications were minimal and manageable. In conclusion, surgical therapy for eyelid correction in patients with facial paralysis is an effective and safe approach, offering significant improvement in both functional and cosmetic outcomes.",1
"Clinical outcome of emergency repeat coronary artery bypass surgery. Emergency repeat coronary artery bypass surgery is a high-risk procedure with limited data on clinical outcomes. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the clinical outcome of patients undergoing emergency repeat coronary artery bypass surgery. A total of 75 patients who underwent emergency repeat coronary artery bypass surgery were included. The primary outcome measure was in-hospital mortality, and secondary outcome measures included postoperative complications, length of stay, and need for reoperation. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 9.3%, with the majority of deaths occurring within 30 days post-surgery. Patients who required emergency repeat coronary artery bypass surgery due to graft failure or graft infection had higher mortality rates compared to those with other indications. Postoperative complications included bleeding, infection, and respiratory complications. The length of stay was significantly longer for patients with postoperative complications. These findings suggest that emergency repeat coronary artery bypass surgery carries significant risk and careful patient selection and management is crucial for optimal outcomes.",1

"Asymptomatic rhabdomyolysis of unknown etiology. Rhabdomyolysis is a syndrome characterized by the breakdown of skeletal muscle fibers, leading to the release of myoglobin and other intracellular contents into the bloodstream. While commonly associated with trauma or exercise-induced muscle injury, it can also occur in the absence of obvious precipitating factors. This case presents an unusual scenario of asymptomatic rhabdomyolysis in a patient without any identifiable etiology. The patient, a 45-year-old male, presented with elevated creatine kinase levels and myoglobinuria but had no history of trauma, recent strenuous exercise, or use of potentially myotoxic medications. Laboratory investigations did not reveal any underlying metabolic, infectious, or inflammatory abnormalities. This case highlights the importance of considering atypical causes of rhabdomyolysis and conducting further investigations to identify potential underlying etiologies. Further research is warranted to determine the mechanisms and appropriate management strategies in cases of asymptomatic rhabdomyolysis.",1

This study provides valuable evidence supporting the use of intravenous nicardipine hydrochloride for the management of postoperative hypertension.",1
"Stroke recurrence within 2 years after ischemic infarction.  We prospectively studied stroke recurrence in 1,273 patients with ischemic stroke who were entered into the Stroke Data Bank. We prospectively studied 1,273 patients with ischemic stroke who were entered into the Stroke Data Bank to determine the rate of stroke recurrence within 2 years following the initial infarction. Patients were followed up at regular intervals and data on recurrence were collected. At the end of the 2-year follow-up period, we found that 12.7% of patients had experienced another stroke. The majority of recurrent strokes occurred within the first year after the initial event, with a smaller proportion occurring in the second year. Age was found to be a significant predictor of stroke recurrence, with older patients being at higher risk. Other factors such as sex, history of hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and previous stroke did not significantly affect the recurrence rate. These findings suggest the need for close monitoring and early intervention strategies in older patients following an ischemic stroke to prevent recurrence.",1
"Reconstruction of mandibular defects in irradiated patients.  In this prospective study, mandibular reconstruction using titanium plates was evaluated in 31 patients treated between July 1988 and January 1990. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and outcomes of mandibular reconstruction using titanium plates in irradiated patients. A total of 31 patients who underwent mandibular reconstruction between July 1988 and January 1990 were included in this prospective study. The patients were assessed for complications, functional outcomes, and aesthetic results. The results showed that mandibular reconstruction using titanium plates in irradiated patients was successful in restoring mandibular function and providing satisfactory aesthetic outcomes. Complications such as infection and hardware exposure were observed in a small number of cases, but overall, the procedure was well-tolerated by the patients.

"Angina, ischemia, and effort tolerance with vasodilating beta-blockers. Many patients with angina and ischemia are prescribed beta-blockers to improve their symptoms and reduce the risk of adverse cardiac events. However, some patients may experience a reduction in exercise tolerance when taking vasodilating beta-blockers. This study aimed to investigate the effects of vasodilating beta-blockers on effort tolerance in patients with angina and ischemia.

A total of 100 patients with stable angina and evidence of myocardial ischemia on exercise cardiac stress testing were included in the study. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either a vasodilating beta-blocker (group A) or a non-vasodilating beta-blocker (group B). Effort tolerance was assessed using a symptom-limited exercise tolerance test at baseline and after 6 months of treatment.

The results showed that patients in group A had a significant reduction in exercise tolerance compared to baseline after 6 months of treatment (p<0.05). In contrast, patients in group B had no significant change in exercise tolerance (p>0.05). These findings suggest that vasodilating beta-blockers may be associated with a reduction in effort tolerance in patients with angina and ischemia.

In conclusion, the use of vasodilating beta-blockers in patients with angina and ischemia may lead to a decrease in exercise tolerance. Clinicians should consider this potential side effect when selecting beta-blockers for these patients and closely monitor their symptoms and exercise capacity. Further research is needed to explore the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon and identify strategies to mitigate its impact on patient care.",1

"Matched group study of surgical resection versus cobalt-60 plaque radiotherapy for primary choroidal or ciliary body melanoma.  We report the results of a nonrandomized, matched-group, survival and visual preservation study of patients with a choroidal or ciliary body melanoma managed by microsurgical resection of the tumor versus cobalt-60 episcleral plaque radiotherapy. Forty-two patients with primary choroidal or ciliary body melanoma were included in this study. Eighteen patients underwent microsurgical resection of the tumor, while 24 patients received cobalt-60 episcleral plaque radiotherapy. The two groups were matched based on tumor size, location, and patient demographics. Survival rates and visual preservation were assessed at specific time intervals post-treatment. The results showed that patients who underwent microsurgical resection had higher rates of disease-free survival compared to those who received radiotherapy. However, there was no significant difference in overall survival rates between the two groups. Regarding visual preservation, patients in the resection group demonstrated better visual outcomes compared to the radiotherapy group. These findings suggest that microsurgical resection may be a more favorable treatment option for primary choroidal or ciliary body melanoma in terms of disease control and visual preservation.",1

"Wrist flexion as an adjunct to the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome. Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common condition characterized by compression of the median nerve in the wrist. The diagnosis of CTS traditionally relies on clinical findings, electrodiagnostic studies, and imaging. This study aimed to evaluate the use of wrist flexion as an adjunctive diagnostic tool for CTS. A total of 50 patients with suspected CTS underwent wrist flexion testing, in which the patient's wrist was flexed for 60 seconds and any resulting symptoms were recorded. The results showed that wrist flexion induced symptoms in 44 patients, with a sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 76% for CTS diagnosis. This suggests that wrist flexion testing can be a useful adjunctive tool in the diagnostic evaluation of CTS. Further studies are warranted to validate these findings and explore the potential clinical implications.",1
"Critical review of gangliosides and thyrotropin-releasing hormone in peripheral neuromuscular diseases. Gangliosides and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) have been extensively studied in the context of peripheral neuromuscular diseases. This critical review aims to evaluate the existing evidence surrounding the use of these agents in the diagnosis and treatment of these conditions. 

Numerous studies have investigated the role of gangliosides in peripheral neuropathies and muscular dystrophies. These complex glycosphingolipids have been found to participate in cell signaling, nerve regeneration, and immunomodulation. However, the clinical efficacy of gangliosides in treating these diseases remains controversial, with inconsistent results reported across different trials.

Similarly, TRH, a neuropeptide, has been proposed as a potential therapeutic agent in peripheral neuromuscular diseases. Preliminary studies suggest that TRH can improve muscle strength and function, possibly by enhancing neuromuscular transmission and promoting muscle regeneration. Nonetheless, further research is needed to establish the optimal dosage, duration, and safety profile of TRH therapy in these conditions.

In summary, while gangliosides and TRH show promise as adjunctive therapies in peripheral neuromuscular diseases, their efficacy and safety profiles require further investigation. Future well-designed clinical trials are warranted to elucidate their potential benefits and limitations in this patient population.",1

"Development of language in six hemispherectomized patients. Hemispherectomy is a surgical procedure that involves the removal or disconnection of one cerebral hemisphere to treat severe refractory epilepsy. This study aims to investigate the development of language in six patients who underwent hemispherectomy. The patients' ages ranged from 3 to 12 years (mean, 7 years). Language assessment was conducted using standardized tests and qualitative analysis of spontaneous speech. Results showed that all patients demonstrated language acquisition capabilities post-surgery, although at varying levels. Two patients achieved age-appropriate language skills, while the remaining four patients showed significant language delays. Qualitative analysis revealed that the patients relied more on non-verbal communication strategies, such as gestures and facial expressions, to compensate for their language deficits. These findings suggest that although language development can occur following hemispherectomy, there may be ongoing challenges related to expressive language skills. Further research is needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms and optimize language interventions in this population.",1

"Effects of anticonvulsant treatment and low levels of folate and thiamine on amine metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of anticonvulsant treatment and low levels of folate and thiamine on amine metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF samples were obtained from patients with epilepsy who were undergoing anticonvulsant treatment and had low levels of folate and thiamine. The levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and their respective metabolites were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. The results showed that anticonvulsant treatment and low folate and thiamine levels were associated with alterations in the levels of amine metabolites in CSF. Specifically, there was a significant decrease in the levels of dopamine and serotonin metabolites, while the levels of norepinephrine metabolites showed a non-significant trend towards decrease. These findings suggest that anticonvulsant treatment and low levels of folate and thiamine may contribute to alterations in amine neurotransmitter systems in the central nervous system, which could have implications for the management of epilepsy and related neurological disorders. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these observations and to explore potential therapeutic interventions targeting the amine neurotransmitter pathways.",1
"Management of mycotic rupture of the ascending aorta after heart-lung transplantation.  A 19-year-old woman underwent heart-lung transplantation for obstructive bronchiolitis.

"Hashimoto's encephalopathy: a steroid-responsive disorder associated with high anti-thyroid antibody titers--report of 5 cases. Hashimoto's encephalopathy (HE) is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by neuropsychiatric symptoms and high anti-thyroid antibody titers. We present a case series of five patients with HE, all of whom had elevated anti-thyroglobulin and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies. The patients were predominantly middle-aged women with a history of autoimmune thyroid disease. Neurological symptoms included cognitive impairment, seizures, myoclonus, and psychosis. Three patients had abnormal electroencephalogram findings consistent with encephalopathy. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was normal in all cases. Treatment with corticosteroids led to a rapid improvement in symptoms and a decline in antibody titers. Maintenance therapy with low-dose prednisone was required in all cases to prevent relapse. This case series highlights the importance of recognizing HE as a potential cause of encephalopathy in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease. Clinicians should consider HE in patients with unexplained neurological symptoms and high anti-thyroid antibody titers, as prompt diagnosis and treatment with corticosteroids can lead to a favorable outcome.",1
"The gonadotropin-releasing hormone associated peptide reduces calcium entry in prolactin-secreting cells. The effects of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone associated peptide (GAP) on calcium entry in prolactin-secreting cells were investigated. Prolactin-secreting cells were isolated from female rats and exposed to various concentrations of GAP. Calcium entry was measured using a fluorescent calcium indicator. It was found that GAP significantly reduced calcium entry in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect of GAP was reversible upon removal of the peptide, suggesting that it acts through a transient mechanism. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of GAP was specific to prolactin-secreting cells, as it did not affect calcium entry in other cell types. These findings highlight the potential role of GAP as a modulator of prolactin secretion and provide important insights into the regulation of hormone release.",1
"The role of endoscopic injection sclerotherapy in the management of bleeding peristomal varices. Peristomal varices are a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of portal hypertension in patients with end-stage liver disease. These varices can cause significant bleeding, leading to substantial morbidity and mortality. The management of peristomal variceal bleeding remains challenging, with limited options available. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) in the treatment of bleeding peristomal varices.

A retrospective analysis of patients with bleeding peristomal varices who underwent EIS between 2010 and 2020 was conducted. The primary outcome measure was the control of bleeding, assessed by cessation of active bleeding at endoscopy and absence of re-bleeding within 72 hours. Secondary endpoints included complications related to the procedure, need for repeat intervention, and overall survival.

A total of 25 patients were included in the study. EIS was successful in achieving hemostasis in 92% of cases, with no immediate re-bleeding observed within 72 hours. Complications related to EIS were rare, with only two cases of minor bleeding at the injection site. The median overall survival of patients was 14 months.

In conclusion, EIS appears to be an effective and safe treatment option for bleeding peristomal varices. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm these findings and determine long-term outcomes.",1
"Multiple-pulse stimulation and dantrolene in malignant hyperthermia. Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a potentially fatal disorder triggered by exposure to certain anesthetic agents. Prompt recognition and management are crucial to prevent morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of multiple-pulse stimulation (MPS) and dantrolene in managing MH. 

A retrospective analysis was conducted on 30 patients diagnosed with MH who received treatment at our institution between January 2010 and December 2020. All patients received standard therapy, including prompt discontinuation of triggering agents, initiation of supportive measures, and administration of dantrolene. In addition, MPS was employed in 15 patients as an adjunctive treatment.

The results demonstrated that patients who received MPS had a significantly lower maximum temperature (p<0.001) and shorter duration of hyperthermia (p=0.002) compared to those who didn't receive MPS. Moreover, the MPS group had a significantly lower incidence of complications, such as rhabdomyolysis and renal failure (p=0.03).

In conclusion, the adjunctive use of MPS in the management of MH appears to be associated with improved outcomes, including lower maximum temperatures and shorter duration of hyperthermia. Further prospective studies are warranted to validate these findings and establish the optimal strategies for managing MH.",1

These findings contribute to the understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying meningioma development and may lead to the development of targeted therapies for this disease. Further studies are warranted to validate these findings and explore their clinical implications.",1
"A double-blind study of deflazacort and prednisone in patients with chronic inflammatory disorders. This abstract discusses a double-blind study comparing the efficacy and safety of deflazacort and prednisone in patients with chronic inflammatory disorders. Chronic inflammatory disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and asthma, often require long-term corticosteroid treatment. However, the use of corticosteroids is associated with various side effects. Therefore, alternative treatment options with improved safety profiles are needed. 

The study aimed to evaluate whether deflazacort, a corticosteroid with fewer side effects than prednisone, could provide similar therapeutic benefits in patients with chronic inflammatory disorders. A total of 100 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either deflazacort or prednisone for a duration of 12 weeks. Outcome measures included disease activity scores, adverse events, and laboratory parameters.

Preliminary results showed that both deflazacort and prednisone effectively reduced disease activity scores. However, deflazacort was associated with a significantly lower incidence of side effects compared to prednisone. Further analysis of the data, including long-term follow-up, is warranted to confirm these findings and establish deflazacort as a viable alternative to prednisone in the treatment of chronic inflammatory disorders.",1
"Angiography, angioscopy, and ultrasound imaging before and after percutaneous balloon angioplasty. This study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of angiography, angioscopy, and ultrasound imaging in the assessment of peripheral artery disease (PAD) before and after percutaneous balloon angioplasty (PBA). A total of 50 patients with PAD underwent these imaging modalities before and after PBA. Angiography provided accurate information about the extent and severity of arterial stenosis, allowing for appropriate treatment planning. Angioscopy, although limited by its invasiveness, provided valuable visual confirmation of the presence and characteristics of atherosclerotic plaques. Ultrasound imaging allowed for the assessment of arterial wall thickness, plaque morphology, and blood flow dynamics. Following PBA, repeat angiography showed successful restoration of blood flow in the treated vessels. Angioscopy revealed improved plaque morphology and reduced thrombus burden. Ultrasound imaging demonstrated decreased arterial wall thickness and improved blood flow velocities. These findings suggest that a combination of angiography, angioscopy, and ultrasound imaging can provide comprehensive information for the evaluation and follow-up of patients with PAD undergoing PBA.",1
A successful treatment of an intrarenal arteriovenous fistula by percutaneous embolization. This case report describes a successful percutaneous embolization procedure for the treatment of an intrarenal arteriovenous fistula (AVF). The patient was a 56-year-old male presenting with hematuria and flank pain. Imaging studies revealed the presence of an intrarenal AVF within the left kidney. The patient underwent a percutaneous embolization procedure in which a catheter was advanced into the feeding artery of the AVF and embolic material was injected to occlude the abnormal connection between the arterial and venous systems. Follow-up imaging studies demonstrated complete obliteration of the AVF and resolution of the patient's symptoms. No complications were observed during or after the procedure. Percutaneous embolization is a safe and effective treatment option for intrarenal AVF and should be considered in patients presenting with similar symptoms.,1
"The influence of calcium alginate haemostatic swabs upon operative blood loss in adenotonsillectomy.  Although adenotonsillectomy is regarded as a minor procedure, it has been shown that 18% of patients may experience an operative blood loss of 10-20% of the total blood volume. To evaluate the influence of calcium alginate haemostatic swabs on operative blood loss in adenotonsillectomy, a prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted on 100 patients undergoing this procedure. The patients were divided into two groups, with one group receiving standard surgical techniques and the other group receiving the additional use of calcium alginate haemostatic swabs. Operative blood loss was measured by calculating the difference between the preoperative and postoperative hemoglobin levels. 

The study found that the use of calcium alginate haemostatic swabs significantly reduced operative blood loss in adenotonsillectomy. The mean blood loss in the group that received the swabs was 8.2% of the total blood volume, while the mean blood loss in the control group was 14.6%. These results indicate that the use of calcium alginate haemostatic swabs can effectively reduce operative blood loss in adenotonsillectomy and may have implications for improving patient outcomes and reducing the need for blood transfusions.",1
"Reversal of chronic hepatic encephalopathy by colonic exclusion: poor correlation with blood GABA levels. Chronic hepatic encephalopathy, a neuropsychiatric syndrome associated with liver dysfunction, can be reversed by colonic exclusion, a surgical procedure that diverts portal blood away from the colon. We investigated the correlation between reversal of hepatic encephalopathy and blood gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in 15 patients who underwent colonic exclusion. Improvement in neuropsychiatric symptoms was observed in 12 out of 15 patients, while blood GABA levels decreased in only 7 patients. There was no significant correlation between the reversal of hepatic encephalopathy and blood GABA levels. These findings suggest that factors other than GABA might play a role in the pathophysiology of hepatic encephalopathy.

"Reversal of chronic hepatic encephalopathy by colonic exclusion: poor correlation with blood GABA levels. Chronic hepatic encephalopathy (CHE) is a debilitating condition associated with liver cirrhosis. Colonic exclusion has been proposed as a potential treatment option to reverse CHE. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of colonic exclusion and its correlation with blood gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels. A total of 30 patients with CHE underwent colonic exclusion surgery and were followed up for a period of 12 months. Clinical improvement of CHE symptoms was observed in 20 out of 30 patients (66.7%). However, there was no significant correlation between the improvement in CHE symptoms and the levels of blood GABA. Thus, while colonic exclusion may lead to reversal of CHE, its mechanism of action appears to be independent of blood GABA levels. Further research is needed to investigate alternative pathways involved in the resolution of CHE.",1
"Serial neurobehavioral assessments in preterm infants. Serial neurobehavioral assessments play a vital role in monitoring the neurodevelopmental progress of preterm infants. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of such assessments in predicting long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes in this vulnerable population. A systematic review was conducted, including studies published between 2000 and 2020. The search yielded 15 eligible studies that met the inclusion criteria. Results indicated a significant association between early neurobehavioral scores and later cognitive, motor, and behavioral outcomes. Infants who exhibited poorer neurobehavioral performance during their initial assessments were more likely to have developmental delays and cognitive impairments during follow-up evaluations. Additionally, longitudinal assessments provided valuable insights into the developmental trajectory of preterm infants, enabling early intervention strategies to be implemented. Given their prognostic value, serial neurobehavioral assessments should be routinely incorporated into the care of preterm infants to optimize neurodevelopmental outcomes.

"Endothelial cell adhesiveness for human T lymphocytes is inhibited by transforming growth factor-beta 1. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-尾1) has been shown to play a crucial role in modulating immune responses and regulating cell adhesion. In this study, the researchers investigate the effect of TGF-尾1 on the endothelial cell adhesiveness for human T lymphocytes. By using an in vitro adhesion assay, they demonstrate that the presence of TGF-尾1 significantly reduces the adhesion of T lymphocytes to endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of TGF-尾1 on T lymphocyte adhesion is mediated through its downregulation of adhesion molecules, particularly vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). These findings suggest that TGF-尾1 can suppress T lymphocyte recruitment to inflamed tissues by inhibiting endothelial cell adhesiveness. This study provides insight into the potential therapeutic applications of TGF-尾1 in diseases characterized by excessive T lymphocyte infiltration and inflammation.",1
"Discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs in children who have outgrown epilepsy: effects on cognitive function. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are commonly used to control seizures in children with epilepsy. However, the long-term effects of AEDs on cognitive function in children who have outgrown their epilepsy and are considered seizure-free remain unclear. In this study, we examined the cognitive function of 50 children who had discontinued AEDs after achieving seizure freedom. We found that discontinuation of AEDs did not have a significant impact on overall cognitive function or the majority of specific cognitive domains assessed, including attention, memory, and executive function. However, a small subset of children showed a decline in cognitive function following AED discontinuation. This suggests that while most children can safely discontinue AEDs without significant cognitive consequences, a careful evaluation of individual cases is necessary to identify those at risk for cognitive decline.",1

"Is sick sinus syndrome an adenosine-mediated disease? Effects of intravenous aminophylline on sick sinus node function after pharmacologic autonomic blockade. Sick sinus syndrome (SSS) is a clinical condition characterized by abnormal sinus node function leading to bradycardia or pauses in cardiac rhythm. The underlying pathophysiology of SSS is not fully understood, but there is evidence to suggest an involvement of adenosine-mediated mechanisms. This study aimed to investigate the effects of intravenous aminophylline, a non-selective adenosine receptor antagonist, on sick sinus node function after pharmacologic autonomic blockade. 

A total of 50 patients with documented SSS were enrolled in the study. All patients underwent pharmacologic autonomic blockade with atropine and propranolol to eliminate any autonomic influences on sinus node function. Measurements of sinus node recovery time (SNRT) and corrected sinus node recovery time (CSNRT) were obtained before and after intravenous administration of aminophylline. 

The results demonstrated a significant improvement in SNRT and CSNRT following aminophylline administration. The mean SNRT decreased from 1.2 卤 0.4 to 0.8 卤 0.3 seconds (p < 0.001), and the mean CSNRT decreased from 1.4 卤 0.5 to 1.0 卤 0.3 seconds (p < 0.001). These findings suggest that sick sinus syndrome may involve adenosine-mediated mechanisms, and that intravenous aminophylline could be a potential therapeutic option for improving sinus node function in these patients.",1

Overall, internalised ureteric stents are a valuable tool in the management of renal transplant recipients.",1
"Doppler echocardiographic evaluation of streptokinase lysis of thrombosed right-sided St.  Jude Medical valves in patients with congenital heart defects. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of streptokinase lysis in thrombosed right-sided St. Jude Medical valves in patients with congenital heart defects using Doppler echocardiography. Ten patients with congenital heart defects who underwent streptokinase lysis for thrombosed right-sided St. Jude Medical valves were included in the study. Doppler echocardiography was performed before and after lysis to assess valve function and thrombus resolution. The results showed significant improvement in valve function post-lysis, with a decrease in mean transvalvular pressure gradient and an increase in effective orifice area. Thrombus resolution was observed in all patients, with complete thrombus dissolution in six patients. No major complications were observed during the procedure. These findings suggest that streptokinase lysis is effective in treating thrombosed right-sided St. Jude Medical valves in patients with congenital heart defects and can be monitored using Doppler echocardiography.",1
"Immunoprofile of mucoepidermoid carcinomas of minor salivary glands. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) is the most common malignancy of minor salivary glands (MSGs). However, limited information is available regarding the immunoprofile of MECs specifically arising from MSGs. In this study, we analyzed the expression of commonly used immunohistochemical markers in a cohort of MECs originating from MSGs. A total of 30 cases were included, and immunohistochemical staining was performed using markers for epidermal differentiation (cytokeratin 14), mucin production (MUC1 and MUC4), and proliferation (Ki-67). Additionally, markers related to neuroendocrine differentiation (chromogranin A and synaptophysin) were assessed. Our findings revealed heterogeneous expression patterns among MECs arising from MSGs, suggesting potential variations in tumor behavior and therapeutic response. Further investigations are warranted to validate these findings and explore their clinical implications.",1
"Study of preneoplastic changes of liver cells by immunohistochemical and molecular hybridization techniques. Preneoplastic changes in the liver are important markers for the early detection of liver cancer. Immunohistochemical and molecular hybridization techniques have been widely used to study these changes. This study aimed to investigate the preneoplastic changes of liver cells using these techniques. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to detect the expression of specific biomarkers associated with liver carcinogenesis. Additionally, molecular hybridization techniques, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), were employed to examine chromosomal abnormalities and gene amplifications in the preneoplastic liver cells.

These findings contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying liver carcinogenesis and provide potential targets for early diagnosis and intervention.",1
"Effects of tracheal irritation and hypercapnia on tracheal smooth muscle in humans. Tracheal irritation and hypercapnia are two common challenges that the respiratory system faces. However, their effects on tracheal smooth muscle in humans remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the impact of tracheal irritation and hypercapnia on tracheal smooth muscle function.

Using isolated human tracheal rings obtained from cadaveric donors, we exposed the tissue to varying concentrations of irritants and increased levels of carbon dioxide to mimic hypercapnic conditions. We observed that tracheal irritation resulted in a dose-dependent increase in tracheal smooth muscle contraction, accompanied by enhanced responsiveness to contractile agents. Interestingly, hypercapnia alone did not significantly affect tracheal smooth muscle function, but it potentiated the contractile response to irritants, indicating a synergistic effect between these two stimuli.

Further investigation revealed that the underlying mechanisms involve the activation of specific signaling pathways, including the RhoA/ROCK pathway, which plays a crucial role in mediating tracheal smooth muscle contraction.

These findings provide valuable insights into the pathophysiology of tracheal smooth muscle dysfunction in conditions associated with airway irritation and hypercapnia, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and respiratory infections. Targeting the RhoA/ROCK pathway may offer potential therapeutic strategies for managing tracheal smooth muscle hyperresponsiveness in these conditions.",1
"Orthostatic hypotension in human immunodeficiency virus infection may be the result of generalized autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Orthostatic hypotension, a common complication in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, has been proposed to be associated with generalized dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). In order to investigate this relationship, a study was conducted on a group of HIV-infected individuals. Autonomic function tests, including heart rate variability and sympathetic skin response, were performed to assess ANS function. The results showed significantly decreased heart rate variability and abnormal sympathetic skin response in patients with orthostatic hypotension compared to those without. These findings suggest that dysfunction of the ANS may contribute to the development of orthostatic hypotension in individuals with HIV infection.",1
"Overt hepatic encephalopathy precipitated by zinc deficiency. Zinc deficiency is a well-known cause of hepatic encephalopathy, a neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by abnormalities in cognition and behavior in patients with liver disease. This case report presents a 53-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who developed overt hepatic encephalopathy after a period of malnutrition and zinc deficiency. The patient presented with altered mental status, confusion, and worsening liver function tests. Laboratory workup revealed significantly decreased serum zinc levels. Upon initiation of zinc supplementation, the patient's mental status improved and liver function tests normalized. This case highlights the importance of considering zinc deficiency as a potential precipitating factor for hepatic encephalopathy in patients with liver disease. Early recognition and prompt treatment of zinc deficiency may prevent the development or progression of hepatic encephalopathy in susceptible individuals. Further studies are needed to explore the mechanisms underlying the relationship between zinc deficiency and hepatic encephalopathy.",1
"A randomized trial of the effect of three non-steroid anti-inflammatory agents in ameliorating cancer-induced fever.  Paraneoplastic fever is well known, and is not an uncommon problem in daily practice. Paraneoplastic fever is a common problem encountered in clinical practice. This randomized trial aimed to assess the efficacy of three non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in alleviating cancer-induced fever. A total of 60 patients with confirmed paraneoplastic fever were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: group A received ibuprofen, group B received naproxen, and group C received meloxicam. The primary outcome measure was the reduction in body temperature after 48 hours of treatment.

The results showed that all three NSAIDs effectively reduced fever in the study population. However, there were significant differences in the magnitude of temperature reduction among the three groups. Group C, which received meloxicam, exhibited the greatest reduction in body temperature compared to groups A and B (p<0.05). Furthermore, no significant adverse effects were observed in any of the treatment groups.

In conclusion, this randomized trial demonstrates the efficacy of NSAIDs in ameliorating cancer-induced fever. Meloxicam appears to be the most effective NSAID in reducing body temperature in patients with paraneoplastic fever. Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and optimize the use of NSAIDs in the management of cancer-induced fever.",1

This case highlights a rare and challenging complication of HES, as well as the importance of early recognition and aggressive management of eosinophilic disorders. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms linking HES to lymphomagenesis and develop targeted therapies for these patients.",1
"A new method for mapping hepatic subsegment: counterstaining identification technique. The liver is a complex organ consisting of multiple subsegments that play crucial roles in various physiological processes. Proper mapping of hepatic subsegments is important for surgical planning and guiding intraoperative procedures. However, traditional methods for subsegment identification are often challenging and time-consuming. 

This study presents a new counterstaining identification technique for mapping hepatic subsegments. The technique involves the use of a specific counterstain, such as indocyanine green or iodine contrast, which selectively stains the target subsegment area. This allows for clear demarcation and visualization of the subsegment boundaries during surgical exploration or imaging procedures. 

Preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the counterstaining identification technique in accurately identifying hepatic subsegments. The technique provides a practical and reliable approach for surgeons and radiologists to precisely locate and delineate hepatic subsegments, facilitating more accurate surgical planning and improving patient outcomes. Further studies are warranted to assess the technique's long-term efficacy and benefits in clinical practice.",1
"Crohn disease in the pediatric patient: CT evaluation. Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory condition that primarily affects the gastrointestinal tract and can occur in pediatric patients. Computed tomography (CT) is a commonly used imaging modality to evaluate the extent and severity of the disease. This study aimed to evaluate the role of CT in assessing pediatric patients with Crohn's disease. Sixty pediatric patients diagnosed with Crohn's disease underwent CT scans, and the findings were analyzed. The CT scans revealed typical features of Crohn's disease, such as bowel wall thickening, mural stratification, and mesenteric lymphadenopathy. Additionally, CT provided valuable information regarding the presence of complications, such as abscesses, fistulas, and strictures. CT findings correlated well with clinical and endoscopic findings, aiding in the diagnosis and management of pediatric Crohn's disease. However, the use of CT in pediatric patients must be balanced with the potential risks of ionizing radiation. Therefore, careful consideration should be given to the necessity and optimization of CT imaging in this patient population.",1
"The surprising kidney-fluid mechanism for pressure control--its infinite gain! In this short paper, I have tried to explain the elation that we felt when we first realized that the kidney-fluid mechanism for controlling the arterial pressure has an infinite feedback gain property. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which the kidney-fluid system controls arterial pressure and discovered a surprising property - an infinite feedback gain. We conducted experiments using a mathematical model to simulate the interaction between the kidney and arterial pressure. Our findings revealed that the kidney-fluid mechanism has the ability to continuously adjust arterial pressure by self-regulating the volume of fluid excreted. This infinite feedback gain property allows for rapid and precise control of arterial pressure even in the presence of external disturbances. Understanding this mechanism provides valuable insights into the complex regulation of arterial pressure and may have implications for the development of new therapeutic approaches for hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases.",1
"Preoperative piroxicam for postoperative analgesia in dental surgery.  Fifty patients were allocated randomly to receive placebo or piroxicam 40 mg, 2. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of preoperative piroxicam for postoperative analgesia in dental surgery. Fifty patients were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or piroxicam 40 mg, 2 hours before the surgery. Postoperative pain intensity was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) at specific time intervals. The results showed that patients in the piroxicam group had significantly lower pain scores compared to the placebo group at all time points. Furthermore, the piroxicam group required fewer rescue analgesics compared to the placebo group. These findings suggest that preoperative piroxicam administration effectively reduces postoperative pain in dental surgery patients.",1

"Experimental retinal branch vein occlusion in miniature pigs induces local tissue hypoxia and vasoproliferative microangiopathy. Retinal branch vein occlusion (BRVO) is a common retinal vascular disorder that can lead to severe visual impairment. Animal models are essential for understanding the pathophysiology and developing new treatments for this condition. In this study, we induced experimental BRVO in miniature pigs to investigate the development of local tissue hypoxia and vasoproliferative microangiopathy. The BRVO was created by laser photocoagulation of the retinal vein, resulting in occlusion and subsequent tissue ischemia. Histological examination of the occluded retinal veins revealed marked hypoxic changes and the presence of vasoproliferative microangiopathy. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated increased expression of angiogenic and pro-inflammatory factors in the affected retinal tissue. This experimental animal model accurately recapitulates key pathological features observed in human BRVO, making it a valuable tool for further research and therapeutic interventions in this debilitating retinal disorder.",1
"A seromuscular stripping method to create a nipple valve without metal stapling for continent urinary reservoir. Continent urinary reservoirs are commonly used in patients who have undergone cystectomy for urinary tract reconstruction. One of the most popular techniques for creating a continent reservoir is the use of a nipple valve, which allows for the controlled release of urine. However, traditional nipple valve creations involve the use of metal stapling, which can be associated with complications such as stapler malfunction and corrosion. 

In this study, we present a novel technique for creating a nipple valve without the use of metal stapling. The seromuscular stripping method involves the removal of the mucosa and submucosa from a segment of bowel and then folding and suturing the seromuscular layer to create a valve-like structure. This technique was successfully utilized in 15 patients undergoing cystectomy and continent reservoir creation. 

Postoperative follow-up revealed excellent patient satisfaction and continence rates. Furthermore, none of the patients experienced complications related to the nipple valve creation. The seromuscular stripping method offers a safe and effective alternative to traditional nipple valve creations in continent urinary reservoir surgery.",1
"Standards for evaluating results of interventional therapy for peripheral vascular disease. Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) is a common condition characterized by narrowing or blockage of blood vessels outside of the heart and brain. Interventional therapy is frequently employed to treat this condition and includes procedures such as angioplasty, stenting, and bypass surgery. However, there is a lack of standardized criteria to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions. 

This study aimed to establish standards for evaluating the results of interventional therapy in PVD. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to identify outcome measures commonly used in previous studies. Based on the review, a set of criteria was developed that encompassed both objective measures, such as improvement in blood flow and reduction in symptoms, as well as subjective measures, such as quality of life and patient satisfaction. 

These standards were then applied to a cohort of PVD patients who underwent interventional therapy. Results showed that the majority of patients experienced improved blood flow, reduced symptoms, and increased quality of life following the intervention. Patient satisfaction was high, with a significant proportion reporting a positive overall experience. 

In conclusion, the establishment of standardized criteria for evaluating the results of interventional therapy in PVD provides clinicians and researchers with a comprehensive framework to assess the effectiveness of these interventions. This will ultimately improve patient care by facilitating informed decision-making and optimizing treatment outcomes.",1
"Hemodynamic effects of H2-receptor antagonists. H2-receptor antagonists are commonly used in the treatment of gastric acid-related disorders such as peptic ulcers and gastroesophageal reflux disease. In addition to their well-known acid-suppressing effects, these medications have been reported to have hemodynamic effects. Specifically, H2-receptor antagonists have been shown to decrease systemic vascular resistance and increase cardiac output. These effects are thought to be mediated by histamine receptors present in vascular smooth muscle and cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, H2-receptor antagonists have been associated with alterations in blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac contractility. However, the clinical significance of these hemodynamic changes and their impact on patient outcomes remain to be fully elucidated. Further research is needed to better understand the hemodynamic effects of H2-receptor antagonists and their clinical implications.",1
"Acute water intoxication as a complication of urine drug testing in the workplace Urine drug testing is now mandatory in many industries. The use of urine drug testing in the workplace is becoming increasingly prevalent in numerous industries. However, this screening method can lead to unexpected complications such as acute water intoxication. We present a case of a 32-year-old male who suffered from acute water intoxication following a urine drug test. The individual had ingested an excessive amount of water in an attempt to dilute any potential drugs in his system. This resulted in hyponatremia and subsequent neurological symptoms including confusion and seizures. The patient was promptly treated with intravenous hypertonic saline and showed significant improvement. This case highlights the importance of educating individuals about the risks associated with tampering or adulterating urine samples, as well as the need for careful monitoring and appropriate protocols to mitigate the occurrence of acute water intoxication during urine drug testing.",1
"Assessing the severity of dementia.  Patient and caregiver. Assessing the severity of dementia is crucial for determining appropriate interventions and predicting disease progression. While standardized cognitive tests are commonly used to measure cognitive decline, they may not fully capture the impact of dementia on patient functioning and the caregiver's burden. This study aimed to evaluate the correlation between patient and caregiver ratings of dementia severity and identify factors that influence their perceptions.

Participants included 100 patients diagnosed with dementia and their primary caregivers. Dementia severity was assessed using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale, as well as structured interviews with patients and caregivers. Measures of functional ability, behavioral symptoms, and caregiver burden were also collected.

Results indicated a significant correlation between patient and caregiver ratings of dementia severity, suggesting that both groups have a similar understanding of the disease's impact. However, caregiver ratings tended to be higher, emphasizing the potential influence of caregiver burden on perception. Patient functional ability and behavioral symptoms were found to be significant predictors of dementia severity, highlighting the importance of considering these factors in assessments.

These findings support the inclusion of caregiver perspectives in dementia severity assessments and emphasize the need for comprehensive evaluation tools that capture both cognitive and functional aspects of the disease. Such an approach can enhance the understanding of disease progression and facilitate personalized care planning for patients and their caregivers.",1
"Evaluation of the fine needle aspiration biopsy in the preoperative selection of cold thyroid nodules. Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is widely used in the evaluation of thyroid nodules. However, its accuracy in distinguishing benign from malignant nodules, particularly in cold nodules, remains unclear. This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic value of FNAB in the preoperative selection of cold thyroid nodules. A total of 200 patients with cold thyroid nodules who underwent FNAB were included in this retrospective study. The results of FNAB were compared with the final pathological diagnosis obtained from surgical resection specimens.

Among the 200 patients, 40 were diagnosed with malignant nodules and 160 with benign nodules. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of FNAB were 82.5%, 90.6%, 61.5%, 96.3%, and 88.5%, respectively. Overall, FNAB showed high specificity and accuracy in the preoperative selection of cold thyroid nodules. However, its sensitivity and PPV were relatively lower. Further studies are needed to improve the accuracy of FNAB in diagnosing malignancy in cold thyroid nodules.",1
"Suppressive effects of visceral tumor on the generation of antitumor T cells for adoptive immunotherapy. Visceral tumors have been shown to possess suppressive effects on the generation of antitumor T cells, which can limit the efficacy of adoptive immunotherapy. In this study, the authors investigated the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon using a mouse model of colorectal cancer. They found that the presence of a visceral tumor led to a significant decrease in the generation of antitumor T cells in the tumor microenvironment. This was associated with an increased expression of immune checkpoint molecules, such as PD-1 and CTLA-4, on T cells, as well as an upregulation of immunosuppressive factors, including TGF-尾 and IL-10, in the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, the authors demonstrated that the suppressive effects of the tumor could be reversed by blocking immune checkpoint molecules or by inhibiting the immunosuppressive factors. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the suppressive effects of visceral tumors on antitumor T cell generation and suggest potential strategies for improving the efficacy of adoptive immunotherapy in patients with visceral tumors.",1
"Regional differences in the intranodal distribution of tumor cells. The intranodal distribution of tumor cells has been shown to vary regionally within lymph nodes. This study aimed to investigate the regional differences in the intranodal distribution of tumor cells in colorectal cancer patients. Lymph nodes from 25 patients who underwent surgical resection for colorectal cancer were included in the analysis. Immunohistochemistry was performed to identify tumor cells within the lymph nodes. The lymph nodes were divided into four regions: central, perihilar, pericapsular, and peripheral. The number of tumor cells was quantified in each region. Significant regional differences were observed in the distribution of tumor cells within the lymph nodes. The central region had the highest number of tumor cells, followed by the perihilar and pericapsular regions. The peripheral region had the lowest number of tumor cells. These findings suggest that the intranodal distribution of tumor cells is not uniform and may have implications for the staging, prognosis, and treatment of colorectal cancer. Further studies are warranted to explore the underlying mechanisms driving these regional differences.",1
"Thyroidectomy under local anesthesia. Thyroidectomy is a common procedure performed under general anesthesia. However, there is growing evidence supporting the use of local anesthesia as an alternative approach. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of thyroidectomy under local anesthesia in a cohort of 50 patients. The surgical technique involved infiltration of local anesthetic into the surgical site and the use of sedation to ensure patient comfort. The outcomes assessed included operative time, postoperative pain scores, complications, patient satisfaction, and vocal cord function. The results showed that thyroidectomy under local anesthesia was feasible and well-tolerated by the patients. The mean operative time was comparable to that of procedures performed under general anesthesia. Postoperative pain scores were generally low, and there were no major complications reported. Patient satisfaction was high, and vocal cord function was preserved in all cases. These findings support the use of local anesthesia for thyroidectomy, providing an option for patients who are unable to tolerate general anesthesia or prefer a less invasive approach.",1
"Aggressive therapeutic amniocentesis for treatment of twin-twin transfusion syndrome.  Acute severe twin-twin transfusion syndrome occurs in about 1% of monochorionic twin gestations. Twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) is a serious complication in monochorionic twin pregnancies, affecting approximately 1% of cases. Aggressive therapeutic amniocentesis has been proposed as a treatment option for acute severe TTTS. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of this intervention. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 50 cases of acute severe TTTS treated with aggressive therapeutic amniocentesis between 2010 and 2015. The overall survival rate of at least one twin was 80% after the procedure. Short-term complications, including preterm premature rupture of membranes and chorioamnionitis, occurred in 15% of cases. Long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years of age were favorable, with 75% of survivors having normal developmental milestones. Aggressive therapeutic amniocentesis appears to be a viable treatment option for acute severe TTTS, achieving high survival rates and favorable neurodevelopmental outcomes in the surviving twins. Further studies are warranted to optimize the technique and assess long-term outcomes.",1
"Dissection of the cardinal ligament in radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer with emphasis on the lateral ligament. Radical hysterectomy is a surgical procedure commonly used for the treatment of cervical cancer. The cardinal ligament plays a crucial role in this procedure as it provides structural support and contains the uterine vessels. However, the dissection of the cardinal ligament can be challenging due to its anatomical complexity. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dissecting the lateral ligament of the cardinal ligament during radical hysterectomy.

A total of 235 patients with cervical cancer underwent radical hysterectomy with lateral ligament dissection.

A 20-month-old child received 25 brief halothane general anaesthetics over a five-week period to allow cranial irradiation treatments for a posterior fossa ependymoma. We report a case of elevated serum bromide concentrations following repeated halothane anesthesia in a 20-month-old child. The child received a total of 25 brief halothane general anesthetics over a five-week period as part of cranial irradiation treatments for a posterior fossa ependymoma. Serum bromide concentrations were measured before each anesthesia and showed a consistently increasing trend throughout the treatment course. The highest recorded serum bromide concentration was 18.6 mmol/L, which is significantly above the normal range of 0.2-1.2 mmol/L. The child exhibited symptoms of bromide toxicity, including lethargy, ataxia, and decreased deep tendon reflexes. Sodium chloride infusions were administered to augment renal excretion of bromide and resulted in a gradual decline in serum bromide levels. This case highlights the importance of monitoring serum bromide concentrations in patients undergoing repeated halothane anesthesia, particularly in children.",1
"Regional differences in the intranodal distribution of tumor cells. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate regional differences in the intranodal distribution of tumor cells in patients with metastatic cancer.

Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 50 patients with confirmed metastatic cancer who underwent lymph node dissection. The lymph nodes were divided into four regions: central, peripheral, inferior, and superior. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides were examined to determine the presence and location of tumor cells within each lymph node region. The density of tumor cells was quantified using digital image analysis.

Results: Intranodal distribution of tumor cells varied among regions. The central region had the highest density of tumor cells, followed by the peripheral region. The inferior and superior regions had significantly lower densities of tumor cells compared to the central and peripheral regions (p < 0.05). Additionally, there were variations in the localization of tumor cells within individual lymph nodes, with some nodes showing a preferential distribution in the central or peripheral regions.

Conclusion: Our findings suggest that there are regional differences in the intranodal distribution of tumor cells in patients with metastatic cancer. Understanding these regional variations may have implications for disease staging and treatment planning. Further research is required to elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving these regional differences.",1
"A protocol for the investigation of pregnancy loss. Pregnancy loss is a devastating experience for many women, and the search for answers as to the cause can be of great importance. This abstract outlines a protocol for the investigation of pregnancy loss, aiming to provide guidance for healthcare providers in this area.

The protocol begins with a thorough medical history and physical examination of the patient, focusing on any previous pregnancy losses, medical conditions, and potential risk factors. Laboratory tests, including a complete blood count, blood typing, and tests for thyroid function and autoimmune diseases, should be performed to identify any underlying factors that may contribute to pregnancy loss.

Further diagnostic tests such as genetic testing, imaging studies, and endometrial evaluation may be considered based on the individual patient's history and findings. Additionally, evaluating the male partner's fertility status through semen analysis is recommended.

For patients with recurrent pregnancy loss, an in-depth evaluation of possible causes is imperative. This may include chromosomal analysis, evaluation of uterine anomalies, and assessment for thrombophilic disorders.

By following this protocol, healthcare providers can systematically investigate the causes of pregnancy loss, thus providing patients with answers and potentially enabling the implementation of appropriate interventions and management strategies.",1
"Premature alveolar bone loss in Erdheim-Chester disease.  Erdheim-Chester disease is a rare histiocytosis also known as lipoid granulomatosis.

"Hypertension and acculturation in elderly Mexican Americans: results from 1982-84 Hispanic HANES. This study aimed to assess the relationship between hypertension and acculturation among elderly Mexican Americans using data from the 1982-84 Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HANES). A total of 4,501 Mexican American individuals aged 65 years or older were included in the analysis. Acculturation was measured using language preference and duration of residency in the United States. Hypertension was defined as having systolic blood pressure 鈮140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure 鈮90 mmHg, or taking antihypertensive medications. The results showed that 65% of the participants were hypertensive, with higher prevalence among those with a longer duration of residency and lower use of the Spanish language. After adjusting for potential confounders, individuals with a longer duration of residency had a significantly higher odds of hypertension compared to recent immigrants. Those who primarily spoke English had higher odds of hypertension compared to Spanish speakers. These findings suggest that acculturation may play a role in the development of hypertension in elderly Mexican Americans. Further research is needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms and develop culturally appropriate interventions.",1
"Role of oxygen free radicals in ischemic and reperfused myocardium. This review article focuses on the role of oxygen free radicals in ischemic and reperfused myocardium. Ischemic heart disease, caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle, is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Reperfusion therapy, aimed at restoring blood flow to the ischemic tissue, can paradoxically exacerbate tissue damage by generating oxygen free radicals. Oxygen free radicals are highly reactive molecules that can cause oxidative damage to cellular components, including lipids, proteins, and DNA. This leads to cellular dysfunction, inflammation, and cell death. Various sources of oxygen free radicals, such as mitochondria, leukocytes, and xanthine oxidase, are discussed in this article. The mechanisms by which oxygen free radicals contribute to myocardial injury, including lipid peroxidation, activation of apoptotic pathways, and activation of inflammatory cascades, are also explored. Furthermore, strategies to minimize oxygen free radical-mediated damage, such as the use of antioxidants, are highlighted. Understanding the role of oxygen free radicals in ischemic and reperfused myocardium is crucial for the development of therapeutic interventions to reduce myocardial injury in patients with ischemic heart disease.",1

"Gastric lesions secondary to long-distance running.  Gastrointestinal disorders have been reported during long-distance running. Gastric lesions secondary to long-distance running have been observed in a number of cases. This study reports on two cases of gastric lesions in long-distance runners, including a 45-year-old male and a 37-year-old female. Both patients presented with symptoms such as epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting, occurring during or immediately after long-distance running sessions. Diagnosis was confirmed through upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, which revealed multiple gastric erosions and superficial ulcers. The lesions were localized in the antrum and gastric body. The patients were managed conservatively with a combination of proton pump inhibitors, dietary modifications, and rest. Follow-up endoscopy after four weeks showed complete healing of the lesions. The potential etiology of these lesions includes mechanical trauma to the gastric mucosa due to repetitive and excessive exercise-induced movements, as well as impaired gastric blood flow during intense physical activity.",1
"Neuroendocrine carcinoid tumours of the breast: a variant of carcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation. Neuroendocrine carcinoid tumors of the breast, although rare, have been recognized as a distinct variant of breast carcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation. These tumors exhibit morphological and immunophenotypic features reminiscent of carcinoid tumors found in other locations. Neuroendocrine features include the presence of neuroendocrine granules, expression of neuroendocrine markers such as chromogranin, synaptophysin, and CD56, and the absence of estrogen and progesterone receptors. They tend to occur in older women and are commonly associated with a favorable prognosis. However, there are limited data on the clinicopathologic features and outcomes of these tumors in larger patient cohorts. Further studies are needed to better define the clinical behavior, optimal management strategies, and long-term outcomes of neuroendocrine carcinoid tumors of the breast.

"The risk of large bowel cancer after partial gastrectomy for benign ulcer disease.  The relative risk (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] for colorectal cancer after partial gastrectomy for ulcer disease was examined in a population-based cohort comprising 6459 patients operated during 1950 to 1958.  Follow-up through 1983 revealed 131 cases of colorectal cancer versus 150. expected cases (SIR = 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.73 to 1.02).  The risk of colorectal cancer was not significantly increased after partial gastrectomy for ulcer disease compared to the general population.  However, a modestly increased risk was observed in the subgroup of patients who underwent partial gastrectomy combined with vagotomy (SIR = 1.27; 95% confidence interval, 0.97 to 1.59).  The risk was particularly elevated for cancer of the ascending colon (SIR = 1.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.97 to 2.69).  These findings suggest a potential association between partial gastrectomy combined with vagotomy and an increased risk of colorectal cancer, specifically in the ascending colon.  Further research is needed to confirm these findings and explore potential underlying mechanisms.",1
"Cardiac arrest during hip arthroplasty with a cemented long-stem component. Cardiac arrest during hip arthroplasty is a rare but potentially life-threatening event. We report a case in which a patient suffered a cardiac arrest following the insertion of a cemented long-stem prosthesis during hip arthroplasty. The patient, a 65-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, experienced sudden cardiac arrest just after the cementation of the prosthesis. Immediate resuscitation efforts were initiated, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation. After successful resuscitation, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for further management. Extensive investigations revealed no evidence of myocardial infarction or embolism as the cause of the cardiac arrest. The most likely etiology was thought to be a cement-induced embolism or a transient hemodynamic instability resulting from the insertion of the long-stem component. This case highlights the importance of vigilance and prompt intervention in managing cardiac arrest associated with orthopedic procedures.",1
"Early magnetic resonance imaging in acute traumatic internuclear ophthalmoplegia. This study evaluates the utility of early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis and management of acute traumatic internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO). INO is a specific neurological deficit characterized by impaired horizontal eye movement due to damage to the medial longitudinal fasciculus. We present a case series of three patients with acute traumatic INO who underwent early MRI within 48 hours of injury. MRI findings demonstrated demyelinating lesions in the medial longitudinal fasciculus in all cases. Early MRI allowed for prompt diagnosis and appropriate management of INO, leading to favorable outcomes for all patients. We propose that early MRI should be considered in the diagnostic workup of acute traumatic INO to guide appropriate treatment decisions and optimize patient outcomes.",1

"Amiloride blocks the onset of ACTH-induced hypertension in the sheep. Amiloride, a diuretic and potassium-sparing agent, has been shown to have antihypertensive effects in various animal models. However, its role in the prevention of ACTH-induced hypertension in sheep has not been well studied. In this experimental study, we investigated the effect of amiloride on the onset of ACTH-induced hypertension in sheep. Eighteen sheep were divided into three groups: control, ACTH-treated, and ACTH-treated with amiloride. Blood pressure was monitored continuously, and serum cortisol levels were measured at regular intervals. The results showed that sheep treated with ACTH alone developed hypertension, characterized by a significant increase in mean arterial pressure compared to the control group. However, sheep treated with both ACTH and amiloride showed a delayed onset of hypertension and a significantly lower mean arterial pressure compared to the ACTH-treated group. These findings suggest that amiloride may have a protective effect against ACTH-induced hypertension in sheep. Further studies are warranted to determine the underlying mechanisms and potential clinical applications of amiloride in hypertension management.",1

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of TVS in visualizing and assessing the fetal brain during these gestational periods. A total of 150 pregnant women were included in the study, and TVS examinations were performed using a high-frequency transvaginal probe. The fetal brains were successfully visualized in all cases, and a detailed assessment of brain structures and abnormalities was possible. The results showed that TVS provided high-resolution images and accurate measurements of key fetal brain structures, including the ventricles, corpus callosum, cerebellum, and cortical surface. Additionally, TVS was able to identify and evaluate various brain abnormalities, such as ventriculomegaly and agenesis of the corpus callosum. Overall, TVS was found to be a reliable and valuable tool for assessing the fetal brain in the second and third trimesters, offering potential benefits for the detection and management of fetal brain abnormalities.",1
"Tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesions of the head and neck. Tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesions are rare, non-neoplastic, benign lesions that can occur in the head and neck region. These lesions are characterized by a proliferation of fibrous tissue along with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate. They present as painless, slowly growing masses that can mimic neoplastic lesions. Diagnosis is typically based on histopathological features, which show a fibrotic, storiform pattern with mixed inflammatory cells. Differentiation from neoplastic lesions is important to avoid unnecessary aggressive therapies. Treatment involves surgical excision or conservative management depending on the size, location, and symptoms of the lesion. In this review, we discuss the clinical, histopathological, and management aspects of tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesions in the head and neck region.",1
Isolated lung transplantation for pulmonary fibrosis. Isolated lung transplantation has emerged as a viable treatment option for patients with end-stage pulmonary fibrosis. We present a case report of a 57-year-old male with rapidly progressive idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis who underwent isolated lung transplantation. Pre-operative evaluation revealed severe restrictive lung disease with significant impairment of pulmonary function. The surgical procedure involved single-lung transplantation with the left lung being replaced by a donor lung. Post-operative care included intensive immunosuppressive therapy and close monitoring for any signs of rejection or infection. The patient experienced a successful recovery with improved lung function and resolution of symptoms. Isolated lung transplantation represents a promising treatment modality for patients with pulmonary fibrosis who have exhausted all other therapeutic options.

"Empiric treatment of fungal infections in the neutropenic host. Neutropenic patients are at increased risk for invasive fungal infections due to their compromised immune system. Empiric treatment strategies are essential in preventing morbidity and mortality associated with these infections. In this review, we aim to evaluate the current evidence and guidelines for empiric antifungal therapy in the neutropenic host. 

Various antifungal agents, including azoles, echinocandins, and polyenes, have shown efficacy in the treatment of fungal infections. However, the choice of agent should be guided by factors such as local epidemiology, individual patient risk factors, and the presence of specific pathogens. 

The initiation of empiric antifungal therapy should be considered in neutropenic patients with persistent fever despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, as this is indicative of possible fungal infection. Liposomal amphotericin B or an echinocandin is recommended as the initial choice for high-risk patients. 

The duration of empiric therapy should be individualized based on the resolution of clinical signs and symptoms, normalization of neutrophil counts, and negative fungal cultures. Close monitoring for drug toxicities and the emergence of resistant pathogens is crucial. 

In conclusion, empiric antifungal therapy plays a vital role in the management of fungal infections in neutropenic patients. A tailored approach, considering local factors and patient characteristics, is essential for optimizing treatment outcomes.",1
"Association of Treacher Collins syndrome and translocation 6p21. 31/16p13. 11: exclusion of the locus from these candidate regions. Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by craniofacial abnormalities, including malformation of the ears, eyes, cheekbones, and jaw. Although the genetic basis of TCS has been partially elucidated, the exact causative genes and mechanisms remain largely unknown. Recently, a translocation between the 6p21.31 and 16p13.11 regions has been proposed as a potential genetic alteration associated with TCS. However, the present study aimed to exclude this translocation as a candidate region for TCS.

A cohort of 35 patients with TCS was analyzed for the presence of the translocation using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) techniques. None of the patients showed any evidence of the proposed translocation in either of the candidate regions. This finding suggests that the translocation between 6p21.31 and 16p13.11 is not a causative genetic alteration in TCS.

Further research is warranted to identify the true causative genes and mechanisms underlying TCS, which may provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets for this rare disorder.",1

"Primary orchiectomy versus estrogen therapy in advanced prostatic cancer--a randomized study: results after 7 to 10 years of followup. This study aimed to compare the outcomes of primary orchiectomy versus estrogen therapy in patients with advanced prostatic cancer. A randomized controlled trial was conducted, and patients were followed up for a period of 7 to 10 years. The results show that both treatment options provide effective disease control and improve quality of life. Out of the 150 patients enrolled, 75 underwent orchiectomy, while the remaining 75 received estrogen therapy. The overall survival rates were similar between the two groups, with no statistically significant difference observed (p=0.532). However, there were differences in terms of adverse effects. Patients who underwent orchiectomy experienced more surgical complications, including wound infections and urinary incontinence. On the other hand, patients receiving estrogen therapy reported more thromboembolic events and gynecomastia. These findings indicate that both primary orchiectomy and estrogen therapy are viable treatment options for advanced prostatic cancer, but their respective side effect profiles should be considered when making treatment decisions.",1

"Protective role of vitamin E in biological systems. Vitamin E, a fat-soluble antioxidant, plays a crucial role in protecting biological systems against oxidative stress and damage. This abstract explores the protective role of vitamin E in various aspects of human health. Epidemiological studies have shown that individuals with higher dietary intake or blood levels of vitamin E have a lower risk of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disorders, and certain types of cancer. Vitamin E acts as an effective scavenger of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxyl radicals, preventing lipid peroxidation and subsequent cell membrane damage. Additionally, vitamin E plays a vital role in modulating immune function, reducing inflammation, and enhancing endothelial function. Supplementation with vitamin E has shown promising results in improving outcomes in certain clinical conditions. However, further research is needed to elucidate the optimal dosage and duration of vitamin E supplementation for different populations and disease states.",1
"Intravenous immunoglobulin treatment in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by progressive weakness and impaired sensation in the limbs. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been shown to be an effective treatment for CIDP, but the optimal dosing regimen remains uncertain. This retrospective study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of IVIG treatment in patients with CIDP.

A total of 50 patients diagnosed with CIDP were included in the study. All patients received IVIG treatment at a dose of 2 g/kg body weight divided over five consecutive days. The primary outcome measure was the change in the Medical Research Council (MRC) sum score, which evaluates muscle strength in CIDP patients.

After the IVIG treatment, the MRC sum score significantly improved in 80% of the patients. The mean change in the MRC sum score was 3.5 points, indicating a clinically meaningful improvement in muscle strength. Adverse events were reported in 10% of patients, including mild infusion reactions and transient headaches.

"Interventional radiologic alternatives to cholecystectomy. Cholecystectomy, or surgical removal of the gallbladder, is a commonly performed procedure for the treatment of gallbladder disease. However, in certain cases, interventional radiologic alternatives to cholecystectomy may be considered. These alternatives include percutaneous cholecystostomy, percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with sphincterotomy and gallstone extraction. These procedures aim to address gallbladder disease while minimizing the need for surgical intervention and reducing patient morbidity. Percutaneous cholecystostomy involves the percutaneous insertion of a catheter into the gallbladder to drain bile and relieve symptoms. Percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage involves inserting a needle into the gallbladder and placing a drainage catheter to bypass the obstruction. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with sphincterotomy and gallstone extraction allows for stone removal from the bile ducts without the need for surgical intervention. These interventional radiologic alternatives provide viable options for the management of gallbladder disease, particularly in patients who are not surgical candidates or have high surgical risks. Further research and evaluation are warranted to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of these interventions compared to traditional cholecystectomy.",1
"Short-term memory and sentence comprehension. Previous studies have shown that short-term memory plays a crucial role in sentence comprehension. However, the underlying mechanisms and specific processes involved in this relationship remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of short-term memory in sentence comprehension and examine the extent to which different aspects of short-term memory, such as storage capacity and retrieval processes, contribute to sentence processing. We conducted a series of experiments utilizing a combination of behavioral and neuroimaging techniques to explore these questions. Our results suggest that short-term memory capacity is associated with sentence comprehension abilities, with individuals with higher short-term memory capacity exhibiting better sentence processing performance. Furthermore, our neuroimaging findings indicate that specific brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, are involved in both short-term memory and sentence comprehension processes. These findings provide important insights into the cognitive mechanisms underlying sentence comprehension and highlight the integral role of short-term memory in this complex process.",1
"Primary osteosarcoma of the lung.  Report of two cases and review of the literature. Primary osteosarcoma of the lung is an extremely rare malignancy. We present two cases of primary osteosarcoma of the lung and provide a literature review on this topic. 

Case 1 involved a 46-year-old female with no previous history of malignancies, who presented with cough and hemoptysis. Imaging revealed a large mass in the left lower lobe, and pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of osteosarcoma. The patient underwent surgical resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and has been disease-free for 2 years.

Case 2 involved a 34-year-old male with a history of testicular seminoma treated with surgery and chemotherapy. He presented with dyspnea, and imaging showed multiple lung nodules. A biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of metastatic osteosarcoma. Despite undergoing chemotherapy and immunotherapy, the patient's disease progressed rapidly, and he succumbed to the disease within 6 months.

Based on our cases and a review of the literature, primary osteosarcoma of the lung typically presents as a large mass with nonspecific respiratory symptoms. Surgical resection, when feasible, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy appears to be the treatment of choice. Prognosis is generally poor due to the aggressive nature of this malignancy and the tendency for metastasis. Further studies are needed to better understand the pathogenesis, optimal treatment strategies, and prognosis of primary osteosarcoma of the lung.",1
"Diphenylhydantoin-induced hypogammaglobulinemia in a patient infected with human immunodeficiency virus. We report a case of diphenylhydantoin (DPH)-induced hypogammaglobulinemia in a patient infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The patient was being treated with DPH for seizures associated with AIDS-related central nervous system infection. Subsequently, the patient presented with recurrent bacterial infections and a significant decrease in serum immunoglobulin levels. After discontinuation of DPH, the immunoglobulin levels gradually returned to normal. This case highlights the potential immunomodulatory effects of DPH and the importance of considering drug-induced immunodeficiency in patients with HIV infection. Clinicians should be aware of this potential adverse effect and monitor the immunoglobulin levels in patients receiving DPH therapy, particularly in the setting of underlying immunodeficiency.",1
"Pelvic pain: lessons from anatomy and physiology. Pelvic pain is a common complaint among women, and a comprehensive understanding of its underlying causes is essential for effective management. This review aims to explore the anatomical and physiological aspects of pelvic pain in order to provide a basis for improving diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. The complex anatomy of the pelvis involves multiple organs, including the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, bladder, and rectum, which can all contribute to the sensation of pain. Additionally, hormonal fluctuations and the presence of nerve fibers in the pelvic region further contribute to the complex nature of pelvic pain. By gaining a deeper understanding of the anatomical and physiological factors involved, clinicians can develop tailored interventions and treatment strategies to alleviate pelvic pain and improve patients' quality of life.",1
"Dietary management of acute childhood diarrhea: optimal timing of feeding and appropriate use of milks and mixed diets. Acute childhood diarrhea is a common health issue in developing countries, including Kenya. This study aimed to evaluate the dietary management of acute childhood diarrhea, specifically focusing on the optimal timing of feeding and appropriate use of milks and mixed diets. A total of 200 children under 5 years of age with acute diarrhea were involved in a randomized controlled trial. The intervention group received early refeeding within 4 hours of admission, while the control group followed the conventional practice of delayed refeeding. Results showed that early refeeding significantly reduced the duration of diarrhea and hospital stay compared to delayed refeeding. Additionally, the use of milk-based diets and mixed diets was found to be safe and effective in promoting recovery. This study highlights the importance of timely feeding and appropriate dietary choices in managing acute childhood diarrhea, providing valuable insights for healthcare professionals and caregivers in developing countries.",1
"Small bowel phytobezoar mimicking presentation of Crohn's disease. We present the case of a 34-year-old woman with a history of Crohn's disease who presented with symptoms of recurrent bowel obstruction. Abdominal imaging revealed a focal mass in the small bowel, and a diagnosis of Crohn's disease exacerbation was initially suspected. However, during surgical exploration, a phytobezoar was discovered as the cause of the obstruction. The patient had a history of chronic fruit and vegetable consumption, which likely contributed to the formation of the bezoar. This case highlights the importance of considering alternate diagnoses in patients with a known history of Crohn's disease presenting with symptoms suggestive of bowel obstruction. Awareness of phytobezoar as a potential mimicker of Crohn's disease can prevent unnecessary treatment and delay in surgical intervention.",1
"Child care practices with respect to acute respiratory tract infection in a poor, urban community in Nigeria. In this study, we investigated child care practices related to acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in a poor, urban community in Nigeria. A total of 150 caregivers were surveyed regarding their knowledge and practices surrounding ARTIs. The majority of caregivers (82%) were found to have poor knowledge about the cause, prevention, and treatment of ARTIs. Furthermore, only 45% of caregivers reported practicing proper hand hygiene techniques, such as washing hands with soap and water, to prevent the spread of infections. The use of traditional remedies and self-medication were common practices among caregivers. Additionally, overcrowding and lack of ventilation in households were prevalent in the community, increasing the risk of ARTIs. These findings highlight the need for targeted education and interventions to improve child care practices and reduce the burden of ARTIs in this vulnerable community.",1
"Pathogenesis of antigen-induced arthritis in mice deficient in neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G. The pathogenesis of antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) in mice deficient in neutrophil elastase (NE) and cathepsin G (CG) was investigated. AIA is a well-established model for studying the pathophysiology of rheumatoid arthritis. NE and CG are serine proteases involved in inflammatory processes and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of arthritis. The study aimed to determine the role of NE and CG in AIA by comparing the inflammatory responses in wild-type mice and mice deficient in NE and CG. The results showed that NE and CG deficiency led to a significant reduction in joint swelling and histopathologic changes associated with AIA, indicating their importance in the development of arthritis. Furthermore, the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines was significantly decreased in NE and CG deficient mice compared to wild-type mice, suggesting that NE and CG play a critical role in the regulation of immune responses in AIA. In conclusion, the findings provide further evidence for the involvement of NE and CG in the pathogenesis of arthritis and may have implications for the development of therapeutic interventions targeting these proteases.",1
"Prospective payment system and impairment at discharge. This study aimed to examine the relationship between the prospective payment system (PPS) and impairment at discharge in a population of stroke patients. A total of 126 patients with stroke were included, and their records were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into two groups based on whether they were classified under the PPS or not. Impairment was assessed using the Modified Rankin Scale (MRS), with higher scores indicating greater disability. 

The results showed that patients classified under the PPS had significantly higher MRS scores at discharge compared to those not classified under the PPS. Additionally, patients under the PPS were more likely to have severe impairments (MRS score of 4 or 5) compared to those not under the PPS. Subgroup analysis revealed that this association was particularly pronounced in patients with a longer length of stay in the hospital.

These findings suggest that the PPS may be associated with higher levels of impairment at discharge in stroke patients. Further research is needed to explore the underlying factors contributing to this association and to develop strategies for optimizing patient outcomes under the PPS.",1
"Flow cytometric DNA content of adenoid cystic carcinoma of submandibular gland.  Correlation of histologic features and prognosis. Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) of the submandibular gland is a rare malignancy with a variable prognosis. The correlation between histologic features and prognosis in ACC remains unclear. In this study, flow cytometric DNA content analysis was performed on 32 cases of ACC of the submandibular gland to investigate the correlation between DNA ploidy and histologic features, as well as prognosis. Our results demonstrated that ACC with an aneuploid DNA content had a significantly higher rate of perineural invasion and lymph node metastasis compared to ACC with a diploid DNA content. Furthermore, patients with aneuploid ACC had a significantly shorter overall survival compared to patients with diploid ACC. These findings suggest that flow cytometric DNA content analysis can provide valuable information for predicting the behavior and prognosis of ACC of the submandibular gland.",1
"Compressive neuropathy of spinal nerve roots. Compressive neuropathy of spinal nerve roots refers to a condition where the spinal nerve roots are compressed and subsequently injured, leading to neurological symptoms. This can occur due to various etiologies such as herniated discs, spinal stenosis, or tumor growth. The clinical presentation includes radicular pain, weakness, sensory deficits, and sometimes bladder or bowel dysfunction. Diagnostic tools including physical examination, imaging studies, and electrodiagnostic tests help identify the specific nerve roots affected and the underlying cause. Treatment options range from conservative management, such as physical therapy and analgesics, to surgical intervention for decompression or tumor removal. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate management are essential to alleviate symptoms, prevent further nerve damage, and improve patient outcomes. Further research is needed to optimize diagnostic strategies, refine treatment approaches, and enhance patient quality of life.",1
"Prognostic significance of proteinuria one year after onset of diarrhea-associated hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Proteinuria is considered a prominent prognostic factor in patients with diarrhea-associated hemolytic-uremic syndrome (D+HUS). This study aimed to determine the prognostic significance of proteinuria one year after the onset of D+HUS. 
Data from 68 D+HUS patients were analyzed, and proteinuria levels were assessed at onset and one year after the initial presentation. Results showed that 80% of patients had proteinuria at onset, which decreased to 62% one year later. The median proteinuria levels also significantly decreased from 0.9 g/L at onset to 0.3 g/L after one year. 
Furthermore, patients with persistent proteinuria at one year had a higher risk of renal impairment, hypertension, and abnormal renal ultrasounds. This suggests that proteinuria at one year after D+HUS onset could be an indicator of long-term renal prognosis. Therefore, regular monitoring of proteinuria levels one year after D+HUS is essential for identifying patients at higher risk of chronic renal complications.",1
"Vaginal epithelial abnormalities in patients with CIN: clinical and pathological features and management. Vaginal epithelial abnormalities are commonly observed in patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). However, there is limited research addressing the clinical and pathological features of these abnormalities and their optimal management. This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of vaginal epithelial abnormalities in patients with CIN and propose an appropriate management strategy. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 185 patients diagnosed with CIN, and their medical records were reviewed for clinical and pathological data. Vaginal epithelial abnormalities were observed in 55% of the patients, with 30% showing atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and 25% exhibiting low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL). Further analysis revealed that the presence of abnormal vaginal epithelium was significantly associated with higher CIN grades and positive high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) status. Consequently, a comprehensive management approach that includes close follow-up and risk factor modification should be implemented for patients with CIN and concurrent vaginal epithelial abnormalities to ensure early detection and appropriate intervention.",1
"Effect of exposure of miners to aluminium powder. Exposure to aluminum powder in miners has been associated with various health effects, including respiratory problems, neurological disorders, and a potential increase in the risk of developing lung cancer. However, the specific mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of aluminum powder exposure on miners and its potential health implications. A total of 200 miners were recruited from a mining site and were categorized into two groups based on their duration and intensity of exposure to aluminum powder. Various health parameters, including respiratory function, neurological status, and cancer risk, were assessed and compared between the two groups. Preliminary results indicate a significant decline in respiratory function and an increased prevalence of neurological disorders in miners exposed to higher levels of aluminum powder. Additionally, initial data suggest an elevated risk of developing lung cancer in miners with prolonged exposure to aluminum powder. Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms and establish effective preventive measures for aluminum powder-induced health effects in miners.",1
