"Multimodality cisplatin treatment in nonresectable alpha-fetoprotein-positive hepatoma. Twenty-eight patients with alpha-fetoprotein-positive (AFP+) nonresectable hepatoma have been enrolled in a new multimodality Phase I, II program. Induction therapy consisted of 50 mg/m2 intravenous cisplatin followed by 2100 cGy irradiation to the tumor volume in seven fractions over 10 days. Hepatic arterial infusion of 50 mg/m2 cisplatin (IA-CDDP) was then administered at monthly intervals. Twenty-one patients have completed induction and at least two cycles of IA-CDDP. Twelve-month cumulative survival was 52% for all 28 patients and 69% for the 21 patients completing induction and IA-CDDP. Median survival has not yet been reached. Response rate (complete and partial) was 36% overall and 48% among the 21 patients who completed treatment. The improved survival of the present series of patients as well as the minimal hematologic toxicity suggests possible further integration of new modalities for therapy. ",0
"Quantification of leakage pressures after durotomy repairs in the canine. This study was undertaken to investigate the relative strengths of dural repair using standard suture techniques, suture supplemented with tissue adhesive, and tissue adhesive alone. Uniform 2 mm dural defects were created in adult beagles, repaired, and then subjected to pressurization testing. Defects repaired with suture alone initially leaked within the range of physiologic pressurization, while those supplemented with tissue adhesive or repaired with tissue adhesive alone failed at higher pressurization levels. Histologic sections obtained from the dura treated with fibrin adhesive sealant demonstrated minimal inflammatory response not significantly different than those sections examined at sites repaired by suture alone. A new substance, fibrin adhesive sealant, appears to be useful in effecting dural repair due to its ability to withstand pressures greater than those obtained with suture alone. ",0
"Risk of cancer death in first-degree relatives of patients with hereditary non-polyposis cancer syndrome (Lynch type II): a study of 130 kindreds in the United Kingdom. To estimate the relative risks of cancer in first-degree relatives of index patients, 130 pedigrees of dominantly inherited Lynch type II cancer family syndrome have been analysed. The risk of death from all causes was significantly increased in women over 45 years of age and the overall liability to cancer in women was greater than for men. A sevenfold increase in risk of colon cancer was found in both sexes. In female relatives the risk of breast cancer was increased fivefold and lifetime risk of breast cancer was 1 in 3.7. A screening programme based on estimated risks could be offered to first-degree relatives of index patients with Lynch type II cancer family syndrome. ",0
"Obesity and colorectal adenomatous polyps. Obesity has been investigated as a risk factor for various malignancies, including colon cancer. A case-control study was conducted on patients in three colonoscopy practices in New York City to determine possible risk factors for colorectal adenomatous polyps, a known precursor lesion for most cases of colorectal cancer. Among 301 case subjects with incidence adenomatous polyps (174 men and 127 women) and 506 control subjects (223 men and 283 women), an increased risk was observed with increasing body mass index in women (odds ratio 2.1, 95% confidence interval 1.1-4.0; for highest versus lowest quartile, linear trend P = .02). A nonsignificant trend was observed for men. The increased risk seen in women is consistent with prior observations regarding reproductive hormonal and dietary risk factors for colorectal cancer. ",0
"Relatively enhanced S cone function in the Goldmann-Favre syndrome. Using electrophysiologic and psychophysical tests that measure rod, midspectral, and S (blue) cone function, we studied four patients with the Goldmann-Favre syndrome, an autosomal recessive vitreoretinal degeneration. With spectral electroretinography, the predominant signal was from the S cones. With dark-adapted perimetry, all patients had severely reduced rod sensitivities and subnormal midspectral cone sensitivities. With S cone perimetry, the patients had normal or subnormal S cone function. Sensitivity differences between S and midspectral cones were significantly different from normal; there was relatively higher sensitivity to S cones compared to midspectral cones throughout the visual field. This relationship of dysfunctional cone mechanisms in the Goldmann-Favre syndrome is similar to that in the enhanced S cone syndrome, a recently identified retinal degeneration with S cone hypersensitivity. The results suggest that the Goldmann-Favre and the enhanced S cone syndromes are linked by a common pattern of retinal dysfunction. ",0
"Incidence of myocarditis. A 10-year autopsy study from Malmo, Sweden. Although myocarditis has been known for almost two centuries, data in regard to its incidence have varied widely. Autopsy studies have reported an incidence of 3.5% to as high as 10%. The main reason for such diversity of data appears to be the lack of unanimity as to what constitutes myocarditis. Recently, definitions of myocarditis have been proposed and precise criteria for the morphologic recognition of myocarditis have been published. In this study an analysis of 12,747 consecutive autopsies performed from 1975 to 1984 at Malmo (Sweden) General Hospital was carried out. Applying the newly proposed histologic criteria, the diagnosis of myocarditis was made in 136 cases, which constitute 1.06% of the autopsy population studied. This rate of myocarditis incidence at postmortem is lower by far than rates previously published. ",0
"New approaches to the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of cytomegalovirus infection after transplantation. Infection occurring after solid organ transplantation continues to exert a considerable detrimental effect upon patient and allograft survival. While the search for better targeted immunosuppressive regimens continues, we must seek to improve our ability to both diagnose and treat those infections that do occur after transplantation. Viral infections in general, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections in particular, represent an area in which substantial progress is being made. Improvement in diagnostic modalities has allowed more rapid and precise identification of CMV infection and disease, and the use of antiviral agents that possess activity against CMV has allowed both prophylaxis and treatment of this frequently life-threatening disease. The prophylactic use of presently available agents in combination and the development of less toxic, more potent anti-CMV agents should serve to further lessen the impact of CMV disease upon the field of solid organ transplantation.

"Pancreatic ascites presenting in infancy, with review of the literature. We report a 4-month-old boy with massive ascites in whom a diagnosis of pancreatitis was made on a raised ascitic amylase level after two inconclusive laparotomies. He developed a pseudocyst which was managed with repeated percutaneous needle aspirations, nutrition being maintained intravenously. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) demonstrated a congenital intra-pancreatic cyst. He thrived after operation drainage for recurrent pseudocyst, but repeat ERCP shows that the cyst in the head of the pancreas remains. Pancreatic ascites is rare in children and diagnosis is frequently delayed. A third of reported cases in childhood present in the first year of life. A search for the underlying cause should include an ERCP to demonstrate abnormalities of the pancreaticobiliary ducts. ",0
"Epstein-Barr virus associated oesophageal ulcers in AIDS. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) associated ulceration has not previously been included in the differential diagnosis of oesophageal ulcers in AIDS. We report five cases of oesophageal ulceration in homosexual men with advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection in whom this was considered to be the most likely cause. DNA in situ hybridisation studies showed EBV in biopsy material from three of four patients with oesophageal ulcers and in none of three controls. Of other viruses studied, only human papillomavirus was present, and this was found in both patients and control subjects. These findings support the hypothesis that EBV is an aetiological factor in some cases of AIDS-associated oesophageal ulceration. ",0
"Endoscopic ultrasonography in diagnosis of the extent of gallbladder carcinoma. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) was performed preoperatively in 39 patients with gallbladder carcinoma. Diagnosis of the anatomical extent of gallbladder carcinoma was compared with histologic analysis, and staging accuracy was evaluated according to the TNM classification. Carcinoma considered to be at an early stage with no lymph node metastasis was correctly diagnosed in 87.5%. Differential diagnosis between early and advanced staged tumors was possible in 79.5%. Overall accuracy for depth of tumor invasion (T) was 76.9%. Limitations were due to many stones in the gallbladder and microinfiltration of carcinoma. Assessment of regional lymph node metastasis (N) was at a sensitivity of 81.8% and specificity of 92.9%, for an overall accuracy of 89.7%. We believe endoscopic ultrasonography is useful in the clinical staging of gallbladder carcinoma. ",0
"Combined vesicovaginal-ureterovaginal fistulas associated with a vaginal foreign body. A case is presented of vesicovaginal-ureterovaginal fistulas associated with a neglected vaginal foreign body. The patient complained of a foul-smelling vaginal discharge and was found to have a 4-cm hard vaginal mass on examination. Urinary incontinence developed subsequently. Examination under anesthesia was performed, and an aerosol deodorant cap was operatively removed from her posterior vagina/perirectal space. Subsequent work-up demonstrated the presence of both a vesicovaginal fistula and a right ureterovaginal fistula. The patient underwent a combined vaginal repair of the vesicovaginal fistula and abdominal ureteroneocystostomy. The frequency, types, etiology, and treatment of genitourinary fistulas are reviewed with particular attention to those associated with a vaginal foreign body. ",0
"Lipolytic factors associated with murine and human cancer cachexia. We have identified a lipolytic factor in extracts of a cachexia-inducing murine carcinoma (MAC16) that shows characteristics of an acidic peptide and appears to be composed of three fractions of apparent molecular weights corresponding to 3 kd, 1.5 kd, and 0.7 kd, as determined by exclusion chromatography. Material with identical chromatographic and molecular weight characteristics was also present in the serum of patients with clinical cancer cachexia but absent from normal serum, even under conditions of starvation. The MAC16 lipid factor, when injected into animals bearing the non-cachexia-inducing tumor MAC13, was capable of inducing weight loss without a significant reduction in food intake. Similar lipolytic material, although in lower concentration, was also found in the MAC13 tumor extracts. These findings suggest that cachexia may arise from the enhanced expression of a lipolytic factor associated with tumor cells. ",0
"The reliability of palpation in the assessment of tumours. There is now a joint UICC-AJC classification for cervical lymph nodes based mainly on the size of the nodes. There is a recognized error in palpation, not only for detecting the presence of tumour but also its size. This study used an animal tumour model system to compare the ability of 6 independent observers of varying experience to detect and stage superficially transplanted growths. A preclinical medical student was as good as a Consultant ENT Surgeon in predicting the presence of tumour but the ability to stage tumours accurately was related to experience. Whilst the most experienced observers accurately estimated the size of tumours less than 2 cm, they were less accurate for larger (greater than 2 cm) tumours which were constantly understaged. This phenomenon may have important clinical implications particularly related to current nodal staging criteria. ",0
"Tuberculosis of the esophagus. Tuberculosis of the esophagus is rare. More cases of secondary tuberculosis of the esophagus have been reported compared to primary esophageal tuberculosis. An illustrative case of primary tuberculosis of the esophagus is presented and 54 published cases of esophageal involvement in tuberculosis are reviewed. There were eight primary and 46 secondary cases of esophageal tuberculosis. There were more male than female patients (M/F = 2.6:1) with an average age of 39.2 years (range 6 months to 75 years). Diagnosis can be difficult, being based on clinical, radiological, endoscopic, and histological features and on the response to chemotherapy. Most cases can be successfully treated with antituberculous chemotherapy even in the presence of fistulous tracts. Patients with esophageal tuberculosis in the presence of AIDS do not respond as well to antituberculous chemotherapy. ",0
"Enhanced antitumor reactivity of tumor-sensitized T cells by interferon alfa. Tumor-draining lymph node cells from mice bearing the methylcholanthrene-induced MCA 106 tumors can be sensitized in vitro to acquire antitumor reactivity. We examined the effect of interferon alfa on the function of cells that underwent in vitro sensitization in adoptive immunotherapy. Interferon alfa increased the antitumor reactivity of in vitro sensitized cells in the treatment of MCA 106 pulmonary metastases. This effect was evident in irradiated mice, indicating that a host response to the interferon alfa was not required. Interferon alfa treatment increased class I major histocompatibility complex antigen expression on tumor cells and increased their susceptibility to lysis by in vitro sensitized cells. These results suggest that interferon alfa enhancement of adoptive immunotherapy was mediated by its effect on tumor cells. Interferon alfa may be a useful adjunct to the adoptive immunotherapy of human cancer. ",0
"Multiple intracranial mucoceles associated with phaeohyphomycosis of the paranasal sinuses. The purpose of this article is to alert clinicians to a new pathogenic fungus of the paranasal sinuses called Exserohilum rostratum. Exserohilum species are one of the etiologic agents of phaeohyphomycosis, a constellation of entities caused by dematiaceous fungi. This class of fungal sinus infection has emerged only in the past decade; it occurs primarily in immunocompetent individuals and produces a tenacious, progressive pansinusitis. To our knowledge, this study describes the first case of multiple intracranial mucoceles secondary to E rostratum. The diagnostic workup includes computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging followed by direct microscopic examination of tissue biopsy specimens. A craniotomy followed by a bilateral external ethmoidectomy was necessary for complete extirpation of the infected mucoceles. Aggressive surgical management of this mycotic infection is described.

"Rett syndrome: findings suggesting axonopathy and mitochondrial abnormalities. We report the histopathologic findings of 3 sural nerve biopsies and 1 muscle biopsy from 3 patients with Rett syndrome. The 3 sural nerve biopsies demonstrated a few ultrastructural abnormalities, including the presence of many Pi-granules and mitochondrial changes in the cytoplasm of Schwann cells, occasional bands of Bungner and onion-bulb formations, and mitochondrial alterations in myelinated axons. Morphometric analysis disclosed reduction in the number of large myelinated fibers with normal densities in comparison to those of an age-matched normal control. Light microscopic examination of the biopsied muscle from a 6-year-old patient with Rett syndrome revealed the existence of many small, dark, angulated fibers with NADH-TR staining. Ultrastructural investigation of the muscle confirmed the presence of the dumbbell-shaped mitochondria. Peripheral nerve involvement and the possibility of mitochondrial abnormalities in Rett syndrome were suggested by the results. ",0
"Indications and results of relaxing retinotomy. The authors report their results of a consecutive series of 40 eyes undergoing relaxing retinotomy during vitrectomy to achieve retinal reattachment for the following indications: proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), 21 eyes (52%); trauma, 10 eyes (25%); diabetic retinopathy, 6 eyes (15%); and expulsive choroidal hemorrhage, 3 eyes (8%). Thirty eyes (75%) had undergone previous vitreoretinal procedures. Extended tamponade was achieved in all cases with either silicone oil (27 eyes, 68%) or long-acting gas (13 eyes, 32%). Retinotomy size ranged from 45 degrees to 360 degrees. Intraoperative retinal attachment was possible in all eyes with 33 (83%) achieving total or subtotal retinal attachment including the macula for 5 months or more. Twenty-seven eyes (68%) achieved 3/200 visual acuity or better and 10 (37%) achieved 20/400 or better. Thirteen eyes (32%) failed to achieve 3/200 visual acuity secondary to recurrent detachment (18%), corneal decompensation (8%), macular dysfunction (5%), and glaucoma (3%). ",0
"Temporal movement control in patients with Parkinson's disease. Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have been reported to be unable to modify their movement velocity to adapt to changing environmental demands. For example, when movement amplitude is varied, PD patients usually exhibit a nearly constant peak velocity, whereas elderly subjects show an increase of their peak velocity with increased amplitude. The experiment examined the ability of PD patients to vary the duration of their movement (four different percentages of their maximum) under conditions where temporal, but not spatial, control was emphasised. PD patients had longer movement times than control subjects, but were able to vary the duration of their movement with comparable temporal accuracy to that of elderly subjects. For both groups, the agonist EMG activity increased with decreased movement duration. For the PD patients, the number of agonist bursts increased with increased movement duration. ",0
"Risk factors for white matter changes detected by magnetic resonance imaging in the elderly. We found increased age (p = 0.001) and history or evidence of stroke (p = 0.016) to be significant independent multivariate predictors of the presence and severity of leukoencephalopathy on magnetic resonance imaging brain scans in a mixed population of 35 elderly psychiatric patients and 25 neurologically healthy elderly volunteers. These results suggest that subcortical ischemia, as well as age-related changes that may not be vascular in origin, contribute to the emergence of periventricular and other deep white matter hyperintensities that are commonly seen on the magnetic resonance imaging brain scans of older adults.

"Inflammatory breast cancer. Historically, the prognosis of inflammatory breast cancer has been poor. We conducted a retrospective review to evaluate the recent Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center experience, to evaluate the role of combination chemotherapy, and to compare the effect of surgery and radiation on local/regional failure. Fifty-six patients with local/regional inflammatory breast cancer diagnosed between 1975 and 1984 were identified. All were treated with combination chemotherapy. Overall 5-year survival was 45% with a 5-year disease-free survival rate of 37%. Twenty-one patients were treated with induction chemotherapy followed by mastectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy. Survival and disease-free survival rates were similar to those achieved in patients treated with mastectomy followed by chemotherapy. Residual cancer was found in all 21 patients treated with induction chemotherapy, with extensive disease present in 18, including six of seven complete responders. The local/regional failure rate was 34%. ",0
"The effect of enoximone and dobutamine on hemodynamic performance after open heart surgery. A clinical comparison. In a prospective, randomized study the phosphodiesterase inhibitor enoximone was compared to dobutamine after open heart surgery. In either group 25 patients were treated with enoximone and dobutamine, respectively, beginning immediately after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass until 4 hours postoperatively. The drug was administered as a continuous infusion of 5 micrograms/min/kg body weight. Under enoximone a significant increase of cardiac output [enoximone (E): + 100%; dobutamine (D): + 38%] and a significant decrease of pulmonary vascular resistance (E: -34%, D: +65%) and of total systemic vascular resistance (E: -59%, D: -7%) was achieved. Systemic blood pressure and heart rate were not different. Side effects were not observed. Enoximone proved to be safe and superior to dobutamine in low cardiac output states after open heart surgery. ",0
"Cytologic criteria to distinguish hepatocellular carcinoma from nonneoplastic liver. The authors reviewed a series of fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) specimens of the liver to identify useful cytologic criteria to distinguish hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from nonneoplastic liver. Ten cytologic features were examined in this study: high cellularity, acinar pattern, trabecular pattern, hyperchromasia, pleomorphism, irregularly granular chromatin, uniformly prominent nucleoli, multiple nucleoli, increased nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, and atypical naked hepatocytic nuclei. These features were examined in a series of 82 FNAB specimens from 52 patients with HCC and 30 patients with nonneoplastic lesions. With the use of a step-wise logistic regression analysis, three features were identified as predictive of HCC: increased nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio (P = 0.001), trabecular pattern (P = 0.002), and atypical naked hepatocytic nuclei (P = 0.03). When these three criteria were used, the sensitivity of diagnosing HCC by FNAB was 100%, and the specificity was 87%. ",0
"The accuracy of predictions about progress of patients on a stroke unit. The aim of the study was to check the accuracy of predictions about the factors which affect the progress, in physical abilities and activities of daily living, of patients admitted to a stroke unit. A series of 60 patients admitted consecutively to a stroke unit were assessed on tests of motor, functional and cognitive abilities at admission. On the basis of these assessments predictions were made about the abilities of the patients at discharge. Patients were assessed for level of motor abilities and activities of daily living at discharge and the accuracy of the predictions checked. Predictions were found to be significantly correlated with outcome but the relationships were not so close as to be useful for the clinical management of individual patients. ",0
"Occipital condyle fracture presenting as retropharyngeal hematoma. Reported is the case of a 30-year-old male motorcycle accident victim who was found on plain cervical-spine radiography to have prevertebral soft-tissue swelling. Although subsequent computed tomography demonstrated no cervical-spine fracture, it did reveal a fracture of one occipital condyle. The mechanism, diagnosis, and treatment of occipital condyle fractures are reviewed, as is the ligamentous and fascial anatomy of the cervicocranium. Dissection of fracture hematoma inferiorly along vertically oriented tissue planes is hypothesized as the pathogenesis of our patient's retropharyngeal hematoma. In addition to being a sign of potential cervical-spine injury, post-traumatic prevertebral soft-tissue swelling may also indicate occipital condyle fracture. To avoid overlooking such fractures, computed tomography undertaken to investigate upper cervical-spine prevertebral soft-tissue swelling should always include slices up to the level of the basal skull so as to visualize the condyles.

"Toxicities in rats with free versus liposomal encapsulated cisplatin. Wistar rats (five in each group) were given either 1 mg/kg of free cisplatin, 1 or 2 mg/kg of liposomal encapsulated cisplatin, or saline solution intraperitoneally biweekly for 15 injections. Rats in the free drug group showed significantly less weight gain; two rats died during the study. At necropsy, the free cisplatin--treated rats showed gross and microscopic evidence of peritoneal fibrosis that was not detected in any of the remaining groups. The free cisplatin--treated rats showed serum and histologic evidence of renal damage; all five rats had moderate or severe acute tubular necrosis. No renal abnormalities were detected in rats that received 1 mg/kg, and only focal or mild changes were found in rats that received 2 mg/kg of the liposomal preparation. Neurotoxicity, as determined by nerve conduction and inclined plane studies, developed in rats treated with free and liposomal cisplatin. These results are encouraging and warrant further investigation. ",0
"Chemical peritonitis secondary to intraperitoneal vancomycin. Although previously reported in the literature, the existence of chemical peritonitis due to vancomycin in patients on peritoneal dialysis remains controversial. We report four similar episodes of sterile peritonitis in three patients receiving intraperitoneal (IP) vancomycin. The prior report implicated a change in the brand of vancomycin preparation, from Vancocin to Vancoled, as a contributing factor. We noted the occurrence of such episodes following a switch from Vancocin to a generic preparation from Abbott Laboratories. High-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) profiles of the three preparations show Vancocin to have a lower level of impurities than the other two; the presence of certain contaminants in the other brands may be contributing to the clinical difference observed. We conclude that chemical peritonitis due to IP vancomycin administration does occur, and that increased awareness of this entity could allow other cases to be identified. ",0
"Rhabdomyosarcomas in the head and neck: MR imaging evaluation. To determine the typical magnetic resonance (MR) signal intensity characteristics of rhabdomyosarcomas, short repetition time (TR)/short echo time (TE) (T1-weighted) and long TR (proton density and T2-weighted) images of 13 patients with rhabdomyosarcomas of the head and neck were retrospectively reviewed. Seven patients received gadopentetate dimeglumine injections. The most common MR appearance was that of a homogeneous mass, hyperintense to both muscle and fat on long TR/long TE images and isointense or minimally hyperintense to muscle on short TR/short TE images. All lesions of the patients who received gadopentetate dimeglumine enhanced markedly. Two lesions had intratumoral hemorrhage, and six were markedly heterogeneous in signal intensity. Similar MR signal intensity patterns have been described for lymphomas and nasopharyngeal carcinomas. The forte of MR imaging lies in its ability to delineate precisely the extent of the rhabdomyosarcoma. ",0
"Suggestive evidence that pelvic endometriosis is a progressive disease, whereas deeply infiltrating endometriosis is associated with pelvic pain. In a 3-year prospective study of 643 consecutive laparoscopies for infertility, pelvic pain, or infertility and pain, the pelvic area, the depth of infiltration, and the volume of endometriotic lesions were evaluated. The incidence, area, and volume of subtle lesions decreased with age, whereas for typical lesions these parameters and the depth of infiltration increased with age. Deeply infiltrating endometriosis was strongly associated with pelvic pain, women with pain having larger and deeper lesions. Because deep endometriosis has little emphasis in the revised American Fertility Society classification and after analyzing the diagnoses made in each class, considerations for a simplifying revision with inclusion of deep lesions are suggested. In conclusion, suggestive evidence is presented to support the concept that endometriosis is a progressive disorder, and it is demonstrated that deep endometriosis is strongly associated with pelvic pain.

"Salivary flow rates in patients with head and neck cancer 0.5 to 25 years after radiotherapy. In this clinical study at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, unstimulated and stimulated salivary flow rates were obtained from 47 patients with head and neck cancer who had received mantle, unilateral facial, or bilateral facial field radiotherapy from 0.5 to 25 years earlier. The magnitude of salivary flow rate reduction compared with a healthy control group was primarily related to the radiation dosage and the amount of salivary gland tissue included in the irradiated fields. Flow rates were lower for women in all groups, but these differences were not statistically significant. ",0
"Gallstone dissolution with methyl tert-butyl ether in 120 patients--efficacy and safety. Of 612 patients with cholesterol gallbladder stones, 120 were eligible for percutaneous transhepatic litholysis with methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). Puncture of the gallbladder was successful in 117/120 (97.5%). In 113/117 (96.6%) the stones dissolved. With solitary stones, treatment lasted for an average of 4 hr, with multiple stones 10 hr. Mean hospitalization was 3.6 days. In 3/117 (2.6%) patients a bile leakage developed; 33% reported mild complaints. After the end of treatment 34% had some residue in the gallbladder; two of these patients developed recurrent stones. MTBE is exhaled, is distributed in fatty tissue, and is excreted renally together with its metabolite tert-butanol. Methanol was found only in traces. Gallbladder histology of six patients showed chronic cholecystitis. Since these findings were independent of treatment time and the interval between treatment end and operation, they are most consistent with stone-related changes rather than caused by MTBE. ",0
"Headaches and multiple sclerosis: a clinical study and review of the literature. Whether multiple sclerosis (MS) can cause headaches is controversial. To clarify the association between headaches and MS we prospectively analyzed 104 consecutive MS patients using detailed headache evaluations. Fifty-four patients (52%) reported headaches, compared with 5 of 35 (14%) patients initially suspected to have MS but subsequently proven to have other disorders, and 18 of 100 (18%) matched general neurology patients. The MS patients had tension headaches or vascular headaches of the migraine type; there was no distinctive ""MS headache."" Seven of these patients had headaches with their first MS symptoms, but in only one did headaches recur with disease activity. Headaches did not correlate with any clinical features of MS. We conclude that an association between headaches and MS may exist. ",0
"A phase II multi-institutional trial of low-dose N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate and high-dose 5-fluorouracil as a short-term infusion in the treatment of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. A Southwest Oncology Group study. Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas is a highly lethal malignancy and chemotherapy has had little impact on the natural history of this disease. PALA, used to potentiate 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), has been shown to have synergy in vivo and in vitro. Twenty-seven patients were treated with an intravenous push dose of PALA (250 mg/m2) followed 24 hours later with a 24-hour infusion of 5-FU (2600 mg/m2). This regimen was repeated weekly. There was one partial response of 21 eligible patients with an estimated response rate of 5%. Toxicity was severe with one toxic death and four patients experiencing Grade 4 toxicity. 5-Fluorouracil and PALA, given in the schedule described, do not appear to be effective against adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.

"Flow cytometric analysis of DNA content in partial hydatidiform moles with persistent gestational trophoblastic tumor. Hydatidiform moles may be classified as partial or complete based on genetic and pathologic criteria. Between January 1979 and January 1990, 17 (5.5%) of 310 patients followed for partial mole developed persistent gestational trophoblastic tumor. Tissues from 14 partial moles were available for flow cytometric analysis of DNA content. Eleven partial moles (85%) were triploid, two (15%) were diploid, and one DNA histogram was uninterpretable. All patients with triploid partial moles achieved complete remission with one course of single-agent chemotherapy. The two with diploid partial mole required multiple courses of chemotherapy to achieve gonadotropin remission. Although the DNA content of most partial moles with persistent gestational trophoblastic tumor was triploid, diploid partial moles with persistent tumor were less sensitive to single-agent chemotherapy.

"Transitional cell carcinomatous meningitis after M-VAC (methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin) chemotherapy. The M-VAC (methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin) regimen has been utilized at our two institutions to treat 17 patients with advanced stage transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. We report 2 cases of carcinomatous meningitis resulting from metastatic transitional cell carcinoma which occurred in patients treated with M-VAC. Review of the literature suggests that our experience with central nervous system metastases is not unique, and that treatment of advanced stage transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder with M-VAC may enhance the incidence of meningeal metastases. Carcinomatous meningitis, although rare, is a rapidly fatal manifestation of metastatic transitional cell carcinoma if left untreated. However, prompt diagnosis and early aggressive therapy may result in palliation and stabilization of neurologic status. We review the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of transitional cell carcinomatous meningitis. ",0
"Fetal death due to nonlethal maternal carbon monoxide poisoning. Fetal death due to acute carbon monoxide poisoning is rarely reported in the medical literature. Of the eight cases found in literature review, only one documented the fetal carboxyhemoglobin concentration. This paper reports a fetal death due to accidental nonlethal maternal carbon monoxide intoxication in which both maternal and fetal carboxyhemoglobin concentrations were obtained. The corrected carboxyhemoglobin concentration was 61% at the time of death in utero, while the maternal carboxyhemoglobin was measured at 7% after one hour of supplemental oxygen. The authors review the mechanisms of fetal death and emphasize the different carbon monoxide kinetics in the fetal circulation. ",0
"Resolution of inferior vena cava syndrome after embolization of a hepatic adenoma. A 77-year-old man presented with severe pruritus and massive lower body edema. Computerized axial tomography of the abdomen showed a large hepatic mass compressing the inferior vena cava, and a liver biopsy specimen showed hepatic adenoma. Embolization of vessels feeding the hepatic tumor resulted in complete resolution of pruritus and ascites, and clinical remission has persisted for 1 year following partial obliteration of tumor vasculature. Angiographic ablation of tumor blood supply represents a nonoperative means for inducing clinical remission in patients with symptomatic hepatic adenoma who are at high surgical risk. ",0
"Prediction of variceal hemorrhage in cirrhosis: a prospective follow-up study. Endoscopic, clinical, and laboratory parameters including presence of varices in the gastric fundus, red color sign, diameter and number of variceal columns, platelet count, and the Child status were assessed in 109 patients with cirrhosis and esophageal varices without previous variceal bleeding. During a mean follow-up period of 21 months, the predictive values of these parameters with regard to first bleeding incidence and mortality rate were studied. The incidence of bleeding was 29%, and the mortality rate 46%. Endoscopic criteria (presence of varices in the gastric fundus, presence of the red color sign, and size of the largest varix) as well as alcoholic etiology of cirrhosis showed a significant positive correlation with the bleeding incidence but not with mortality. Contrary to this, two factors of the Child classification (encephalopathy and ascites) and age positively correlated with mortality but not with the bleeding incidence. ",0
"Optimal interpretation of the supine exercise electrocardiogram in patients with right bundle branch block. A detailed analysis of the exercise ECG was performed in 82 patients with right bundle branch block who underwent supine exercise equilibrium radionuclide angiography. The sensitivity and specificity of each individual electrocardiographic lead for the detection of a positive radionuclide angiogram was determined. Leads V5 and V6 had a sensitivity of 58 percent and a specificity of 89 percent. The limb leads and lead V4 had a lower sensitivity, but an equivalent specificity. Leads V1 and V3 each had a clearly lower specificity that ranged from 56 to 67 percent. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that the optimal interpretation of the exercise ECG included the limb leads and V4 to V6, but not V1 to V3. The results of coronary angiography in the subset of 16 patients who underwent this procedure confirmed these findings. ",0
"Surgical management of bile duct stones. The biliary surgeon in the 1990s must be familiar with all of the available techniques for the treatment of bile duct stones. Experience and judgment are important in the successful management of the individual patient with intrahepatic or extrahepatic stones. Knowledge of the nonsurgical methods of stone removal is important in the decision-making process. However, the biliary surgeon must resist the temptation to do less than a thorough removal of all stones at the operation lest the patient be subjected to additional procedures, which carry their own risks of morbidity and death. The goal should be to clear the stones from the biliary system with the fewest procedures offering the lowest morbidity and mortality risks to the patient. ",0
"Pelvic pain: lessons from anatomy and physiology. Pelvic pain is often a difficult differential diagnosis in the emergency department. For physiologic reasons, pain in the pelvis is difficult to localize to a specific organ, and pelvic peritonitis is hard to recognize. On the other hand, differences in types of pain can be very useful in arriving at a correct diagnosis. The clinician must learn to recognize superficial and deep somatic pain, and differentiate between various types of visceral pain which originate from inflammation, ischemia, or colic. A review of the anatomy and physiology of pelvic pain helps identify some of the problems as well as potential aids in approaching the patient with pelvic pain. ",0
"Prevalence and association of asteroid hyalosis with systemic diseases. We performed a cross-sectional study of 12,205 patients, which identified 101 patients (0.83%) with asteroid hyalosis. These patients were examined for associated systemic and ocular conditions. Diabetes mellitus was found in 29 of the patients with asteroid hyalosis (29%), as compared to ten of 101 (10%) control subjects (P = .0007). An increased prevalence of systemic arterial hypertension (61 of 101 [60%] patients with asteroid hyalosis compared with 29 of 101 [29%] control subjects; P = .0001) and atherosclerotic vascular disease (30 of 101 [30%] patients with asteroid hyalosis compared with 13 of 101 [13%] control subjects; P = .006) was also discovered in the asteroid hyalosis group. Additionally, patients with asteroid hyalosis were found to be more hyperopic than control subjects (P = .009). ",0
"Ponderal index as a predictor of postoperative complications. Four hundred sixty-eight patients undergoing elective surgery were prospectively followed for the development of postoperative complications. There was a trend toward increasing complication rate with a lower ponderal index. However, lower ponderal indices were associated with increasing rates of diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Of these patients, forty cases with postoperative complications were matched to 40 control cases for sex, age, concomitant illness and operation performed. The cases of postoperative complications had a statistically significantly lower ponderal index than the controls (11.98 versus 12.43). The increased risk of postoperative complications in those patients with a ponderal index of less than 11 was 3.36, and less than 13 was 3.44. Surgeons who treated patients with lower ponderal indices need to have a high index of suspicion for the development of postoperative complications in these patients. ",0
"Evaluating oxygen delivery and oxygen utilization with mixed venous oxygen saturation monitoring: a case study approach. Three cases studies are presented to demonstrate clinical application of mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) monitoring in critical care nursing practice. Examples of critically ill patients are used to demonstrate how SvO2 monitoring can be used in clinical practice to reflect an imbalance between oxygen delivery and oxygen utilization. In the first case, the patient had a problem with oxygen delivery. Continuous SvO2 data aided nurses in guiding, adjusting, and assessing therapy. The second case demonstrates how SvO2 monitoring can provide an early sign of a life-threatening complication. The final case is one in which the patient had a problem with oxygen utilization. In all the cases, continuous SvO2 data provided important information about the balance between oxygen delivery and oxygen utilization. ",0
"Computerized tomography as an indicator of isolated mesenteric injury. A comparison with peritoneal lavage. This study evaluated 18 patients with blunt abdominal trauma who suffered isolated mesenteric injuries, diagnosed at exploratory laparotomy. Thirteen had diagnostic peritoneal lavage (PL) as their initial diagnostic study, and five had computed tomography (CT). All patients who had positive PL were explored emergently, undergoing repair of mesenteric injuries. Three of the five patients with CT as initial studies had delayed recognition of their injuries due to incorrect initial interpretation of the scan in two, and a false negative scan in one. Two of these patients developed intestinal infarction and required bowel resection. There were no complications in the PL group related to surgery; morbidity was greater in those undergoing CT. We conclude that early laparotomy and repair of significant mesenteric injuries is necessary to reduce morbidity, and that PL is a more sensitive indicator of this injury than CT. ",0
"Economic barriers to the use of oral rehydration therapy. A case report Diarrheal dehydration is a highly prevalent condition among young children and is readily prevented and treated with oral rehydration therapy. We report a death due to hypernatremic dehydration caused by rotavirus diarrhea of a 9-month-old infant whose mother attempted to purchase oral glucose-electrolyte solution in a pharmacy but was unable to afford it. While efforts such as the National ORT Project should help to promote the proper at-home treatment of this condition, we conclude that oral rehydration therapy will not be used optimally by the parents of children living in poverty until the economic barriers to its use are removed.

"Value of monoclonal anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO7) for diagnosing acute leukaemia. The expression of myeloperoxidase (MPO) was studied in 100 cases of acute leukaemia (83 with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and 17 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) by both a conventional cytochemical method and the immunocytochemical antiperoxidase (APAAP) technique using the monoclonal antibody MPO7. In each case the staining was evaluated by light microscopical examination (percentage of positive cells). Of the 83 cases of AML, 78 (93.9%) were positive for MPO7 compared with 70 (84.3%) by cytochemistry. Antibodies against the myeloid markers CD13 and CD33 were positive in 71 (85.5%) and 70 (84.3%) cases, respectively. Importantly, all cases of ALL were negative for both MPO7 and cytochemical MPO staining even when they were positive for CD13 and CD33. These results indicate that the anti-myeloperoxidase antibody MPO7 is the most sensitive and specific reagent for the diagnosis of AML and should therefore be included in routine immunophenotyping panels.

"Lyme disease: recommendations for diagnosis and treatment The incidence and the endemic range of Lyme disease in the United States have increased steadily since the disease was originally recognized in Lyme, Connecticut, in 1975. Because of the varied clinical manifestations of this illness and the use of unstandardized serologic testing methods, diagnosis is often uncertain and treatment outcomes are often difficult to evaluate. The antibiotic regimens that are commonly used in clinical practice have changed rapidly. They show much regional variation with little critical comparison of treatment results. The clinical diagnosis and the literature on the treatment of the various stages of Lyme disease are reviewed. The reported data are supplemented with recommendations based on 15 years of clinical experience with this illness. ",0
"Heart disease in Asians and Pacific-Islanders, Hispanics, and Native Americans. Heart disease is the leading cause of death for Asian-Americans and Pacific-Islanders, Hispanic-Americans, and Native Americans. Generally, heart disease death rates are lower in these population groups than in Caucasians, with the notable exception of Native Americans under the age of 35. Of particular interest are data for southwestern US Native Americans and Mexican-Americans, which indicate low CHD prevalence rates despite high rates of obesity, diabetes mellitus, increasing hypertension, and low socioeconomic status. Much more research is needed to explain these and other observations. Intervention in those risk factors already identified is necessary, particularly in prevention of obesity and diabetes. ",0
"The molecular biology of acute myeloid leukemia. Proto-oncogene expression and function in normal and neoplastic myeloid cells. Proto-oncogenes and suppressor genes fall into four functional groups: growth factors, growth factor and hormone receptors, signal transducers, and transcriptional regulatory factors. Many of these genes are selectively expressed in myeloid cells and may play a role in normal development of the myeloid lineages. Furthermore, chromosomal rearrangements, deletions, and mutations may disrupt the normal expression or function of these genes, promoting MPD and leukemogenesis. Many of the genes altered by karyotypic abnormalities in myeloid disorders are only beginning to be identified. Future studies undoubtedly will determine the molecular mechanisms whereby these genes, residing at karyotypic breakpoints in myeloid disorders, promote neoplastic transformation of myeloid cells.

"Recovery from vegetative state of six months' duration associated with Sinemet (levodopa/carbidopa). Certain pharmacologic interventions may improve outcome for brain injury in animals and humans. Medications affecting the dopaminergic pathway appear to be important. We present the case of a 24-year-old man with traumatic brain injury who remained unresponsive to commands and unchanged for six months despite periodic aggressive therapy. Within days of beginning Sinemet (levodopa/carbidopa), the patient became conversant and responsive. The reported low likelihood of spontaneous recovery of cognition in patients who are vegetative for six months suggests that Sinemet was responsible for this patient's recovery. In this case, the relatively small risk of side effects from Sinemet was greatly outweighed by the change in functional outcome. ",0
"The anatomical basis of the caecocentral scotoma. New observations and a review. It is shown that the 'papillomacular bundle' of optic nerve fibres, although a concept discussed frequently in the clinical literature, lacks a clear anatomical definition. It is suggested that the explanation for this is that the 'bundle' was originally described in autopsy studies of toxic amblyopia, not normal anatomy. The optic nerve fibre projection and vascular architecture of the caecocentral region of the retina is described. These anatomical features are discussed in relation to a number of possible anatomical explanations for the fact that a caecocentral scotoma is the characteristic field defect found in toxic amblyopia. We have been unable to identify a distinct anatomical feature which might explain this vulnerability but suggest that the problem has not as yet been clearly addressed by anatomists. ",0
"Endoscopic findings in Yersinia enterocolitica enterocolitis. The endoscopic findings in the colon and terminal ileum in eight cases of Yersinia enterocolitica enterocolitis infection were studied. The diagnosis was based on the isolation of Y. enterocolitica in the feces and/or elevated serum antibody titers to the organism. Total colonoscopy was performed between 7 and 38 days (mean, 24 days) after the onset of symptoms. In all patients, the terminal ileum was affected, followed by frequent involvement of the ileocecal valve and the cecum, and less frequently, the ascending colon. In the terminal ileum, round or oval elevations with or without ulcers were detected. Small ulcers were detected on the ileocecal valve and in the cecum. These findings were observed even 4 to 5 weeks after the onset of symptoms, suggesting a relatively long course for this disease. ",0
"Surgical resection of intrinsic brain stem lesions: an overview. A major limitation to the effective treatment of intrinsic mass lesions of the brain stem has been the inability to clearly define the pathological anatomy radiographically. The improved soft tissue resolution offered by magnetic resonance imaging, as compared with axial computed tomography, now makes it possible not only to accurately distinguish anatomical relationships, but also to predict the pathological nature of the lesion. Accordingly, we have been encouraged to pursue a more aggressive approach to intrinsic lesions of the brain stem that appear well circumscribed on magnetic resonance imaging scan. The object of this paper is to report the successful treatment of four intrinsic lesions of the brain stem and to present an overview of the relevant published experience. ",0
"Overt hepatic encephalopathy precipitated by zinc deficiency. Encephalopathy in liver disease may be unresponsive to protein restriction, lactulose, and neomycin. Zinc supplements have been reported to improve psychometric performance in liver cirrhosis, but the importance of zinc deficiency in overt hepatic encephalopathy has not yet been clearly established. A patient with severe recurrent hepatic encephalopathy was studied to determine the relation between her signs of encephalopathy and zinc deficiency. The study included a period in which zinc deficiency was artificially induced by oral histidine. An episode of overt encephalopathy occurred that was identical to earlier episodes and responded to oral zinc. The study showed an association between encephalopathy and zinc deficiency by successive zinc depletion and supplementation regimens. Long-term zinc supplementation improved severe recurrent hepatic encephalopathy and therefore the quality of life. ",0
"The cancer experience in the Framingham Heart Study cohort. The almost 40-year records of The Framingham Heart Study (FHS) cohort were reviewed to establish the cancer experience of this noninstitutionalized group of white subjects. Diagnoses were confirmed from pathology and laboratory reports and clinical notes. Age-specific incidence rates were compared with Connecticut Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data. Among the 5209 subjects, 1201 malignancies were confirmed. Median age at diagnosis was 69 for men and 65 for women. Lung, prostate, skin, and colon accounted for more than half of men's cancers; breast, colon, and skin made up half of the women's. FHS and Connecticut SEER rates matched closely, with the same primary tumor sites appearing commonly in both groups. Thus, the FHS cohort should provide a fair database for analysis of risk factors in cancer incidence, as it has done in cardiovascular diseases. ",0
"Prognostic indicators of the resolution of nonimmune hydrops fetalis and survival of the fetus. To delineate any possible prognostic indicators, we reviewed the ultrasonographic and nonmorphometric findings in 19 antenatally diagnosed cases of nonimmune hydrops fetalis in which it was chosen to continue the pregnancy. Thirteen fetuses died and six survived. Of all parameters examined, including associated anomalies, abnormal karyotype, location of serous fluid, anemia, and possible cause of nonimmune hydrops fetalis, the most sensitive prognostic indicator was the real-time-directed M-mode echocardiographic measurement of the biventricular outer dimension in diastole. All fetuses with biventricular outer dimensions greater than 95% died, whereas all but one with normal biventricular outer dimensions had resolution of nonimmune hydrops fetalis and survived. This was highly significant (p less than 0.001) with the predictive value of a normal biventricular outer dimension being 86% and the predictive value of an enlarged biventricular outer dimension being 100%.

"Computed tomography in the evaluation of the aorta in patients sustaining blunt chest trauma. Computed tomography is used with increasing frequency to evaluate blunt chest trauma. Since traumatic aortic rupture (TAR) is a rapidly lethal condition, unnecessary CT scanning may not be justified. To determine the accuracy of chest CT scanning for TAR, we reviewed 17 patients who underwent both chest CT scanning and aortography. Five patients had TAR by aortography. CT scanning yielded three true positives and two false negatives. In 12 patients with a negative aortogram, CT scanning recorded four false positives and eight true negatives. The specificity was 23% and the sensitivity was 83% compared with aortography. The overall accuracy for CT scanning was 53%. From these data we conclude that in the presence of an unstable patient or where there is a strong clinical suspicion of TAR the patient should proceed directly to aortography. ",0
"Gastro-oesophageal reflux during elective laparoscopy. An oesophageal pH electrode was used to record gastro-oesophageal reflux in 73 women who had elective laparoscopy for various gynaecological procedures. No refluxes were recorded during the 63 procedures from which results could be analysed; the upper 95% confidence limit from this observation is 3 in 63 (4.8%). Two of the excluded women refluxed during episodes of hiccough that occurred shortly after induction of anaesthesia. Tracheal intubation may be required during laparoscopy, although the need to protect against the possibility of aspiration of gastric contents may not be a valid reason unless, with the same logic, it is suggested that all patients who hiccough should be intubated.

"Mucinous cystadenoma of the lung. A report of two cases with immunohistochemical and ultrastructural analysis. We describe two patients who presented with solitary pulmonary masses that consisted of unilocular cysts lined by columnar mucinous epithelium. The cysts contained copious mucus. The epithelial lining of the cysts showed foci of stratification and papillary infolding. Histologically identical lesions have previously been termed unusual mucous cysts or mucinous cystadenomas. We believe that these tumors are true neoplasms differentiating toward the respiratory epithelial mucous cell. They should be distinguished from a variety of pulmonary neoplasms including bronchoalveolar carcinoma, bronchial mucous gland adenoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, and metastatic adenocarcinoma. ",0
"Alzheimer's disease and related disorders in state mental hospitals: data from a nationwide survey. Notwithstanding three decades of transferring of the elderly to nursing homes, geriatric patients continue to reside in state mental hospitals. Many of these patients, perhaps one-third or more, are thought to suffer from Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD). This study reports data from a nationwide survey of state hospitals that provides an exploratory look at the ADRD patients currently served in state hospitals. Admission trends, reasons for admission, and sources of referral are described. Civil commitment of nursing home patients with dementing illnesses and the place of the state hospital in the continuum of care for ADRD patients are discussed. ",0
"A controlled trial of psychological treatment for the irritable bowel syndrome. One hundred two patients with irritable bowel syndrome were studied in a controlled trial of psychological treatment involving psychotherapy, relaxation, and standard medical treatment compared with standard medical treatment alone. Patients were only selected if their symptoms had not improved with standard medical treatment over the previous 6 months. At 3 months, the treatment group showed significantly greater improvement than the controls on both gastroenterologists' and patients' ratings of diarrhea and abdominal pain, but constipation changed little. Good prognostic factors included overt psychiatric symptoms and intermittent pain exacerbated by stress, whereas those with constant abdominal pain were helped little by this treatment. This study has demonstrated that psychological treatment is feasible and effective in two thirds of those patients with irritable bowel syndrome who do not respond to standard medical treatment. ",0
"Risk factors for white matter changes detected by magnetic resonance imaging in the elderly. We found increased age (p = 0.001) and history or evidence of stroke (p = 0.016) to be significant independent multivariate predictors of the presence and severity of leukoencephalopathy on magnetic resonance imaging brain scans in a mixed population of 35 elderly psychiatric patients and 25 neurologically healthy elderly volunteers. These results suggest that subcortical ischemia, as well as age-related changes that may not be vascular in origin, contribute to the emergence of periventricular and other deep white matter hyperintensities that are commonly seen on the magnetic resonance imaging brain scans of older adults.

"Radiologic staging of chest in testicular seminoma. We investigated the usefulness of chest x-ray (CXR), conventional planar tomography (TOM), and computerized axial tomography (CAT) in evaluating patients with Stages I and II testicular seminoma. All patients had a CXR, and 22 patients had either TOM or CAT as part of initial staging. No occult pulmonary or mediastinal nodal disease was found during initial staging, and none of the patients manifested recurrence of tumor in these sites as a first event. Review of the literature corroborates our finding of a very small thoracic failure rate in early stage seminoma. Routine use of CAT or TOM is not indicated in staging these patients. ",0
"Autosomal recessive chronic granulomatous disease caused by deletion at a dinucleotide repeat. Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare inherited condition rendering neutrophils incapable of killing invading pathogens. This condition is due to the failure of a multicomponent microbicidal oxidase that normally yields a low-midpoint-potential b cytochrome (cytochrome b245). Although defects in the X chromosome-linked cytochrome account for the majority of CGD patients, as many as 30% of CGD cases are due to an autosomal recessive disease. Of these, greater than 90% have been shown to be defective in the synthesis of a 47-kDa cytosolic component of the oxidase. We demonstrate here in three unrelated cases of autosomal recessive CGD that the identical underlying molecular lesion is a dinucleotide deletion at a GTGT tandem repeat, corresponding to the acceptor site of the first intron-exon junction. Slippage of the DNA duplex at this site may contribute to the high frequency of defects in this gene. ",0
"Treatment of chronic moccasin-type tinea pedis with terbinafine: a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Terbinafine is an orally and topically active fungicidal drug of the allylamine series. Its oral efficacy at 125 mg taken twice daily was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in moccasin-type tinea pedis. The study was conducted simultaneously in two centers and consisted of 41 evaluable cases (23 terbinafine, 18 placebo). Mycologic cure and near to complete clearing of signs and symptoms were obtained in 59% of the terbinafine-treated patients after 6 weeks of treatment and in 65% at 2 weeks after treatment. Corresponding efficacy for placebo-treated patients was zero at both evaluations. Side effects in both groups were minimal. We conclude that terbinafine is well tolerated and highly effective in moccasin-type tinea pedis. ",0
"Gentamicin iontophoresis in the treatment of bacterial otitis externa in the guinea pig model. Pseudomonas otitis externa is one of the most common infections treated by otolaryngologists. Infections induced in 30 guinea pigs appeared similar to that seen in humans. The ears were then placed into four treatment groups: group A, which received a single cleaning; group B, which received a single cleaning followed by gentamicin drops 4 times daily; group C, which received a single cleaning followed by a single gentamicin iontophoresis treatment; and group D, the control group, which received no treatment. Infections were analyzed by grading edema, purulence, and erythema. An average of 10.2 days was required for control group to return to normal appearance. Groups A, B, and C had mean resolution times of 5.9, 4.7, and 4.3 days, respectively. Gentamicin iontophoresis appears to be promising, with results as good as drop therapy in otitis externa in the guinea pig model. ",0
"Choroid plexus tumors in the breast cancer-sarcoma syndrome. Choroid plexus neoplasms are rare epithelial tumors of the central nervous system. A carcinoma of the choroid plexus occurred in a child from a family with the breast cancer-sarcoma syndrome (Li-Fraumeni or SBLA syndrome), an inherited condition characterized by the development of diverse neoplasms (sarcoma, breast cancer, brain tumors, leukemia, adrenal cortical carcinoma, and others). Choroid plexus carcinomas were identified in two kindreds previously reported with the syndrome. The literature contains reports of choroid plexus neoplasms occurring in families and in individuals with multiple primary tumors. Choroid plexus neoplasm may be a manifestation of the inherited proclivity to tumor development in the breast cancer-sarcoma syndrome. ",0
"Major histocompatibility complex antigen expression in the affected tissues in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Monoclonal antibody immunocytochemistry was used to examine spinal cord and muscle in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis for changes that would indicate ongoing or potential immune activity. Increased expression of class I and II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens was seen in the affected areas of spinal cord. New MHC expression was concentrated in phagocytes, particularly in degenerating white matter in which they were dispersed in the tissue and also packed around blood vessels. MHC antigen was not revealed in motor neurons or skeletal muscle fibers. An anti-pan-T-cell monoclonal revealed small numbers of T cells in degenerating white matter. Similar changes have been seen in other neurodegenerative disorders. They suggest a potential for (secondary) cell-mediated activity in the affected areas rather than an ongoing MHC-restricted T-cell response. Vessel-associated phagocytes may be a source of antigen to peripheral lymphoid tissue, stimulating production of the autoantibodies that have been described. ",0
"Natural history of moderate aortic stenosis. The natural history of severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis has been well documented. However, the natural history of moderate aortic stenosis remains poorly understood. Therefore, a group of 66 patients was identified who had a diagnosis of moderate aortic stenosis at the time of cardiac catheterization (aortic valve area 0.7 to 1.2 cm2) and who did not have surgical therapy during the 1st 180 days after cardiac catheterization. During a mean follow-up period of 35 months, 14 patients died of causes attributed to aortic stenosis and 21 underwent aortic valve replacement. The estimated probability for remaining free of any complication of aortic stenosis at the end of the first 4 years was 59%. Symptomatic patients with decreased ejection fraction or hemodynamic evidence of left ventricular decompensation were at greater risk for these complications. It is concluded that patients with moderate aortic stenosis are at significant risk for the development of complications. ",0
"The effect of omental pedicle graft transfer on spinal microcirculation and laminectomy membrane formation. The properties of the omentum and its effect on spinal neurologic disease was investigated. Omental pedicle grafts were transferred to the laminectomized lumbar spines of nine neurologically normal dogs. Grafts were placed on either the dura or the spinal cord. Interruption of the graft's circulation was examined. To study the effect, the artery of the graft was injected with contrast and the graft-dura interface studied histologically. All injected specimens demonstrated vascular connections from the graft to the neural elements. The graft was found to decrease postoperative perineural scarring. The omentum appears to possess properties that could be applied to improve outcomes in spinal surgery. ",0
"Early-onset dementia and extrapyramidal disease: clinicopathological variant of Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker or Alzheimer's disease? A case of progressive dementia and extrapyramidal signs beginning at age 29, with a ten year course until death, is presented. Necropsy examination showed an assortment of plaque types (including striatal plaques), neurofibrillary tangles, granulovacuolar degeneration, and depigmentation of the substantia nigra and locus ceruleus. This case had pathological features found in both Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease and in Alzheimer's disease. While somewhat similar to several other cases with features of both diseases, it differs in the presence of dystonia and striatal plaques. Although such cases may be difficult to categorize at present, they must be considered in the differential diagnosis of early onset dementia. ",0
"Management of macular puckers associated with retinal angiomas. Monocular visual loss in four patients was caused by epiretinal macular membranes associated with peripheral retinal capillary angiomas or angioma-like lesions. Three patients had solitary vascular lesions and one had two discrete vascular lesions. All patients were in good health, with no evidence of the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. In three patients, spontaneous peeling of the macular membranes and visual improvement occurred 2 to 6 months after obliteration of the angioma-like lesions with cryotherapy (two patients), or cryotherapy combined with argon laser (one patient). The fourth patient underwent a vitrectomy 8 months after the macular pucker had failed to respond to treatment of the vascular lesion. ",0
"Surgical results of intrathoracic gastric volvulus complicating hiatal hernia. From 1981 to 1988, 138 patients with hiatal hernia were treated surgically at our centre. Twenty-one (mean age 76.6 years, 17 women, four men) had an associated intrathoracic gastric volvulus. Eleven patients (mean age 73.2 years), of whom eight were asymptomatic, had an elective procedure. Ten patients (mean age 80.3 years) had emergency surgery, six for acute complications of the volvulus (five cases of strangulation and one of perforated ulcer) and four because of other, unrelated causes of acute abdomen. There were four deaths after operation, all in the emergency surgery group. Four other patients had significant morbidity, all in the emergency group. In the elective cases, all hernias were easily reduced. In one emergency case a gastrotomy was necessary for decompression, and in another gastrectomy was necessary because of gastric gangrene. Our results indicate the need for elective intervention when intrathoracic gastric volvulus is first diagnosed. ",0
"Obesity and vaginal hysterectomy. A retrospective study was done of 471 consecutive vaginal hysterectomies done in a three-year period. Three groups of patients--239 normal to 9% overweight, 132 10-24% overweight and 100 greater than or equal to 25% overweight--were compared. Surgical difficulties were similar in all three groups. The more obese patient had a slightly greater incidence of febrile morbidity, stayed one day longer in the hospital and had a minimally greater loss of hemoglobin 48 hours postoperatively. However, obesity per se caused few problems during and after vaginal hysterectomy. The vaginal approach is the procedure of choice for hysterectomy in obese women. ",0
"Experience with the use of coronary autoperfusion catheter during complicated angioplasty. Between February and July of 1989, 22 patients underwent the use of the Stack autoperfusion catheter following acute occlusion or obstructive dissection during coronary angioplasty; in 20 cases conventional balloon was used in an attempt to correct the angiographic appearance followed by the use of Stack catheter when results were sub-optimal. Only 1 patient (4.5%) required surgical revascularization. Although our study is not prospective or randomized, our observations suggest a significant impact in decreasing the need for emergency surgical revascularization after complicated coronary angioplasty with the use of this approach.

"The role of intracaval filters in patients with COPD and DVT. A retrospective study of the Coney Island Hospital experience with Greenfield filters over a five-year period was undertaken. During this period, a total of 78 intracaval filters were placed in 76 patients. The patients' charts were reviewed for (1) indication for Greenfield filter placement, (2) complications of the procedure, (3) associated medical problems, and (4) follow-up information. The data revealed one statistically significant subpopulation within the group that had particularly poor survival statistics after intracaval filter insertion. These were patients who had a pulmonary embolism and also had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Considering the low morbidity associated with this procedure, it is the author's feeling that prophylactic intracaval filters in patients with deep vein thrombosis and COPD may be warranted. ",0
"Differential memory and executive functions in demented patients with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Selected aspects of verbal memory and executive function were compared in 11 demented Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and 11 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with equally severe dementia, with 11 healthy controls matched for age and education. Semantic and episodic memory were impared in all patients compared with controls, but to a relatively greater degree in AD patients than in those with PD. In contrast, demented PD patients were relatively more compromised on executive tasks. These findings, taken in the context of the neuropathological and neurochemical overlap between demented PD and AD patients, suggest that differences in neurobehavioural patterns in patients with these diseases are relative, rather than absolute.

"Intradural spinal cord tumor presenting as a subarachnoid hemorrhage: magnetic resonance imaging diagnosis. Negative findings on four-vessel angiography after a subarachnoid hemorrhage are seen in 5 to 30% of patients. A previously silent lesion in the spinal canal may be responsible for the ictus in a small percentage of this group. The etiological factors include tumors and arteriovenous malformations; however, investigations of such lesions have been limited to patients with signs and symptoms of spinal cord or nerve root pathological processes. This report describes the management of a 56-year-old woman with clinical findings typical of an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and negative findings on cerebral angiography, in whom magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement revealed an intradural extramedullary cervical schwannoma. For this reason, cervicothoracic magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement should be considered as an adjunctive scanning examination in all patients with a subarachnoid hemorrhage and negative findings on angiography.

"Essential hypertension, metabolic disorders, and insulin resistance. Essential hypertension is frequently associated with several metabolic abnormalities, of which obesity, glucose intolerance, and dyslipidemia are the most common. This report discusses the epidemiologic evidence for the coexistence of these risk factors and questions why hyperinsulinemia and essential hypertension cosegregate. The euglycemic insulin clamp and the insulin suppression test are documented with respect to the physiologic functions of insulin, and the mechanisms of insulin resistance in essential hypertension are discussed. Evidence to suggest that insulin resistance is a marker for an ""atherogenic syndrome"" is reviewed. It is concluded that all the hemodynamic and metabolic disorders of essential hypertension and insulin resistance are closely related. The clinical approach to the patient with any of the abnormalities in question should take into consideration the whole cluster, with therapy aimed at ameliorating the entire hemodynamic-metabolic profile.

"Hyponatraemia in patients with cirrhosis. Hyponatraemia occurs in nearly half of patients in hospital with cirrhosis and ascites, and is due to the excessive retention of free water which results from the kidney's inability to excrete it normally. The morbidity and mortality associated with hyponatraemia is largely attributable to central nervous system disturbances. The degree to which brain water content increases depends on the duration of hyponatraemia and on compensatory mechanisms. Altered steroid and peptide hormones in cirrhotic patients may contribute to the development of hyponatraemic encephalopathy, symptoms of which overlap with hepatic encephalopathy and uraemia. The occurrence of central pontine myelinolysis is unrelated to the rate of correction of hyponatraemia. The appearance of hyponatraemia in cirrhotic patients, long regarded as a poor prognostic sign, may be a function of unrecognized underlying impaired renal function. Therapy for hyponatraemia remains suboptimal. ",0
"Itraconazole therapy in aspergillosis: study in 49 patients. Itraconazole, 200 to 400 mg once daily, was administered to 49 patients with different types of aspergillosis: pulmonary aspergilloma (14 patients), chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis (14), and invasive aspergillosis (21). Itraconazole was prescribed alone or in combination or after treatment with amphotericin B and flucytosine. Of 14 aspergilloma patients, 2 were cured and 8 had symptomatic improvement. In chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis, 7 of 14 patients were cured and 6 improved significantly. In invasive aspergillosis treatment failed in 6 patients and 15 were cured. Itraconazole can be an alternative to amphotericin B in the treatment of invasive aspergillosis and chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis. In aspergilloma itraconazole may be useful in inoperable cases. ",0
"Ethyl chloride and venepuncture pain: a comparison with intradermal lidocaine. One hundred and twenty unpremedicated patients undergoing gynaecological surgery were randomly allocated to one of three equal treatment groups to assess the effectiveness of ethyl chloride in producing instant skin anaesthesia to prevent the pain of venepuncture from a 20 G cannula. They received either no anaesthetic, 0.2 ml one per cent lidocaine plain intradermally or a ten-second spray of ethyl chloride at the cannulation site. Ethyl chloride produced skin anaesthesia that significantly reduced the pain of venepuncture. However, it was not as effective as intradermal lidocaine. It had no effect on vein visualisation or ease of cannulation. Ethyl chloride can be recommended as a method of producing instant skin anaesthesia. ",0
"Expression of major histocompatibility complex class II antigens and interleukin-1 by epithelial cells of Warthin's tumor. The immunoreactivity for class II antigens of the major histocompatibility complex and interleukin-1 (IL-1) in Warthin's tumor (WT) cells was studied. In addition to macrophages, dendritic cells, and capillary endothelia, the luminal tumor cells and some keratinocytes in the metaplastic squamous foci exhibited immunoreactivity for both class II antigens and IL-1. The distribution of the class II antigens in the luminal tumor cells was limited to their basolateral membrane. These data, together with previous findings, strongly suggest that the luminal tumor cells of WT introduce the luminal antigen to the underlying lymphoid tissue and, thus, act as an antigen-presenting cell.

"Modified technique of Pringle's maneuver in resection of the liver. Crushing of the hepatic parenchyma with hepatic clamps to minimize blood loss during resection of the liver leads to mechanical damage of hepatocytes. Pringle's maneuver may precipitate liver failure by hepatic warm ischemia as well. Therefore, we controlled bleeding from the surface of the resection by using light compression on the hepatic parenchyma with a band while applying a hepatic arterial clamp at the hepatic hilus. This vascular control method can be done because the portal pressure is about one-tenth of the hepatic artery pressure and provides an efficient and harmless transection of the liver. ",0
"The treatment of chondrodermatitis nodularis with cartilage removal alone. Fifty-eight patients with chondrodermatitis nodularis on the antihelix in 24 ears (16 women and eight men) and the helix in 40 ears (six women and 34 men) were studied. Twelve ears responded to intralesional steroid therapy. Under local anesthetic, 46 operations were performed to remove cartilage without skin excision. On the helix, a longitudinal incision was made; on the antihelix, a flap was raised and the underlying cartilage was excised, taking care to leave no rough cartilage edges. Follow-up (mean, 16 months; range, 4.5 to 34 months) showed that 10 of 17 antihelix lesions and 24 of 29 helix lesions healed completely with excellent cosmetic results. Recurrences, requiring further treatment, occurred at cartilage-excision margins in seven ears, and further cartilage excision alone was successful in four ears. This study demonstrates that only cartilage needs to be removed in the surgical treatment of chondrodermatitis nodularis. ",0
"Esophageal malignancies: is preoperative radiotherapy the way to go? During the period 1969 to 1988, 68 patients with esophageal malignancy were subjected to preoperative radiotherapy consisting of 30 Gy over 3 weeks followed by esophagectomy after a wait of 2 weeks. Sixty-two of 68 patients (91%) were followed up retrospectively (5-year survival rate, 17.2%; 10-year survival rate, 4.8%). Radiosensitivity of the tumor was graded by a radiation effect scoring method devised by us, and this was found to correlate with long-term prognosis (p = 0.05). Radiotherapy ""sterilized"" malignant involvement of adventitia and draining lymph nodes in 8 patients and thereby converted ""palliative"" into potentially ""curative"" resections with a mean survival of 57.2 months in this group of patients. Preoperative radiotherapy was found to increase the survival, decrease the incidence of residual tumor at the resected stump, reduce the incidence of local recurrence, and increase the resectability rate.

"Identification of a melanoma progression antigen as integrin VLA-2. The expression of the integrin receptors VLA-1, -2, -3, and -6 was studied in normal cultured melanocytes and in five melanoma cell lines. Normal melanocytes synthesized VLA-3, but did not reveal detectable levels of VLA-1, -2, and -6. All melanoma cell lines, however, expressed VLA-2, -3, and -6. VLA-1 was synthesized by two of five melanoma lines. In parallel, we had analyzed the expression of four previously characterized melanoma cell surface antigens. One of them (antigen A.1.43), which is associated with tumor progression of human melanoma, revealed a striking similarity to VLA-2. In sequential immunoprecipitation experiments, we show that A.1.43 is identical with the integrin VLA-2, a cell surface receptor for collagen, laminin, and fibronectin. ",0
"Ichthyosis, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, impaired neutrophil chemotaxis, growth retardation, and metaphyseal dysplasia (Shwachman syndrome). Report of a case with extensive skin lesions (clinical, histological, and ultrastructural findings). The Shwachman syndrome comprises exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, growth retardation, and bone marrow hypoplasia resulting in neutropenia. Clinical, morphological, and ultrastructural studies, as well as hair analysis, were performed in a patient with Shwachman's syndrome and severe ichthyosis. Clinical findings were lamellar ichthyosiform desquamation on the extremities. The hair was scanty and short on the scalp, in the eyelashes, and in the eyebrows. The nails were hyperkeratotic. Morphologic findings were slight, regular acanthosis and severe diffuse hyperkeratosis with variable parakeratosis. The granular layer was thickened. The papillary dermis showed very slight perivascular lymphocyte infiltration. The most prominent ultrastructural finding was the presence of solitary or multiple droplets of varying size in the cytoplasm of the keratinocytes. Hair analysis revealed no abnormalities; the cystine concentration in hair specimens was normal. ",0
"Ostium secundum atrial septal defect in the elderly. Atrial septal defect (ASD) is one of the most common congenital cardiac anomalies in adults. Life expectancy is shortened, and almost 90% of patients die by the age of 60 years. The progression of this congenital disease to congestive heart failure has been related to several factors such as the onset of pulmonary hypertension, arrhythmias, bronchopulmonary infections, or the development of other cardiovascular disease. We describe three cases of very old patients with significant ASDs and late development of symptoms. Given the higher risks and poorer long-term results of surgical closure of the defect in advanced age, the indications for such an intervention in elderly patients should be carefully evaluated. ",0
"Gastrointestinal bleeding in a 15 month old male. A presentation of Munchausen's syndrome by proxy. Munchausen's syndrome by Proxy is a well-described entity that may not always be immediately considered in a complicated case. We describe this syndrome being portrayed through the guise of gastrointestinal bleeding in a 15 month old male and discuss not only the difficulty involved in solidifying this diagnosis but also the consequences that may occur should this diagnosis not be entertained. Failure to diagnose Munchausen's syndrome by proxy often results from failure to consider the diagnosis. These cases frequently have specific characteristics that allow seasoned clinicians to suspect the diagnosis. Once the diagnosis is considered, it is crucial to take steps to protect not only the index patient but also siblings who not infrequently are also recipients of this life threatening form of child abuse.

"Fulminating multiple sclerosis-like leukoencephalopathy revealing human immunodeficiency virus infection. A 66-year-old French homosexual man and a 42-year-old Brazilian man with no known risk factors for HIV infection developed headaches, asthenia, and neurologic episodes of abrupt onset. CT showed multiple hypodense, nonenhancing lesions. Serology for HIV was positive. They died respectively 2 months and 1 month after onset of the illnesses. Autopsy in both cases showed multiple, well-demarcated, demyelinating foci in the white matter of the cerebral hemispheres, brainstem, and cerebellum with histologic features characteristic of recent plaques of multiple sclerosis. There were no multinucleated giant cells or microglial nodules. Immunostaining for HIV was negative. Although a random coincidence of MS and HIV infection cannot be ruled out, the close temporal relationship between the 2 disorders suggests a possible etiologic association. ",0
"Small cell carcinoma of the pancreas and biliary tract. Four cases of anaplastic carcinoma of the pancreas or biliary tract were studied clinicopathologically and immunohistochemically. All four cases were intermediate cell type and contained a minimum amount of microscopic foci of differentiated glandular adenocarcinoma. Argyrophilic tumor cells were not seen in any of the four tumors. Immunohistochemically, no tumor was positive for hormonal products, but all tumors were positive for epithelial markers. These findings suggest that the anaplastic carcinoma are not derived from argyrophilic cells, but rather from adenocarcinomas which have the potential for anaplastic metaplasia. The long-term survival of one patient emphasized the importance of chemotherapy in the treatment of small cell carcinoma of the pancreas and biliary tract. ",0
"Esophageal reflux before and after isolated myotomy for achalasia. Four patients with achalasia underwent 24-hour esophageal pH measurements as ambulatory patients before and after limited myotomy without fundoplication. Resting lower esophageal sphincter pressure was reduced from 24.3 +/- 1.3 mm Hg to 7.5 +/- 4.3 mm Hg. No significant differences (p greater than 0.05) were found before and after operation in the total 24-hour pH data distribution (pH 6.24 +/- 0.84 vs 5.75 +/- 1.03), the fraction of time below pH 4.0 (4.8% +/- 5.3% vs 8.0% +/- 6.9%), or the mean duration of reflux episodes greater than 5 minutes (22.8 +/- 18.8 minutes vs 23.0 +/- 10 minutes), all +/- SD. Effective relief of esophageal obstruction in achalasia is feasible by isolated limited myotomy without producing gastroesophageal reflux. ",0
"Iatrogenic saphenous neuralgia: successful therapy with neuroma resection. We report the case of a patient with saphenous neuralgia secondary to iatrogenic trauma resulting from bypass surgery in the femoral-popliteal region. Early symptoms of this condition were medial calf and ankle pain, with no findings of motor and reflex abnormalities. Exploration of the thigh 2 years later revealed a neuroma of the nerve in the distal dissection site, medial to the knee. Resection of the neuroma alleviated this condition. It is noted that saphenous neuropathy is seen as a spontaneous entrapment syndrome as well as a complication of orthopedic and vascular procedures performed on the medial area of the knee. Saphenous neuralgia is often not recognized by neurosurgeons. If the condition is intractable, it does respond to surgical therapy. ",0
"Late juvenile-onset Krabbe's disease. Krabbe's disease is an autosomal recessive leukodystrophy characterized by a lack of galactocerebroside beta-galactosidase activity. In contrast to the classic early infantile-onset form of Krabbe's disease, less recognized, late-onset variants exist. The authors present a case of late juvenile-onset Krabbe's disease, including the associated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. Most patients with late-onset Krabbe's disease present with visual loss due to optic atrophy. Associated gait abnormalities and parental consanguinity should increase the clinician's suspicion that a child may have late-onset Krabbe's disease. Because of the prolonged survival in late-onset Krabbe's disease, the recent development of bone marrow transplantation for these patient makes diagnosis of this disorder particularly important. ",0
"Visual recovery in patients with optic neuritis and visual loss to no light perception. We reviewed the records of 151 patients with optic neuritis examined over an eight-year period. Of these patients, 12 developed visual acuity of no light perception during the first episode of optic neuritis in the affected eye. Eight of the 12 patients recovered visual acuity of 20/40 or better. Of these, five patients had visual acuity of 20/20 or better, one had visual acuity of 20/25, one had visual acuity of 20/30, and one had visual acuity of 20/40. Four of the 12 patients recovered peripheral visual fields but had dense central scotomas and visual acuity of less than 20/400. Dyschromatopsia persisted after visual recovery in 11 of 12 patients.

"Evaluation of treatment protocols on minimal to moderate spasticity in multiple sclerosis. Thirty men and women diagnosed with definite multiple sclerosis (MS) were treated for ten weeks in a blinded, cross-over study. Patients with minimal to moderate spasticity were randomized to one of three sequences to evaluate the effects on MS-related spasticity of baclofen alone, stretching regimen with placebo, placebo alone, and stretching regimen with baclofen. The Cybex II isokinetic unit, timed gait, Ashworth scale, and subject's assessment of function were objective and subjective measures used to evaluate changes in hypertonicity. There was significant correlation between the Cybex and Ashworth as methods of measuring spasticity. Overall, treatment with baclofen alone significantly improved moderate quadriceps spasticity as measured by Cybex flexion scores. A trend, indicative of enhancing the beneficial effects of baclofen, was noted when stretching exercises were added to the treatment. ",0
"Rehabilitation in spinal cord disorders. 2. Anatomy, pathogenesis, and research for neurologic recovery. This self-directed learning module highlights advances in this topic area. It is part of the chapter on rehabilitation in spinal cord disorders in the Self-Directed Medical Knowledge Program Study Guide for practitioners and trainees in physical medicine and rehabilitation. This article contains learning objectives on the anatomy of the spine and spinal cord, pathogenesis of spinal cord trauma, mechanisms of spinal fractures and dislocations, causes of nontraumatic spinal cord disorders, and research on neurologic recovery. Advances that are covered in this section include various experimental animal models for producing spinal cord injury and new approaches to limit damage in acute injury and to promote recovery in chronic injury.

"Multiple primary bronchogenic carcinomas: treatment and follow-up. A second primary bronchogenic carcinoma subsequently developed 8 to 156 months later in 19 patients who underwent curative resection of primary bronchogenic carcinomas. The second primary tumor was treated by surgical resection in 9 patients, 3 patients' tumors were considered unresectable, and the remaining 7 patients, despite having potentially resectable tumors, did not undergo resection because of insufficient pulmonary reserve or unwillingness to undergo resection. Actuarial life-table analysis of survival for the 9 patients who underwent resection showed a median survival time of 110.3 months compared with 19 months for the group with unresected but resectable tumors and 10.5 months for the group with unresectable tumors. There was no operative mortality in the group with resected tumors. We conclude that in patients in whom a second primary carcinoma of the lung develops, surgical resection prolongs survival and can be performed with a low operative mortality. ",0
"Persistent rectal ulcer associated with human papillomavirus type 33 in a patient with AIDS: successful treatment with isotretinoin. Rectal dysplasia and carcinoma associated with human papillomavirus infection are increasing in prevalence among homosexual men, particularly those infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. We report a case involving a 39-year-old homosexual man with AIDS who developed a persistent rectal ulcer. A biopsy of the ulcer revealed severe squamous dysplasia, and human papillomavirus type 33 was detected in rectal tissue with use of in situ DNA hybridization. This genotype of virus has not been previously associated with anal or rectal dysplasia in homosexual men, including those infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. The rectal ulcer resolved after 2 months of oral therapy with 60 mg/d of isotretinoin, a retinoid. ",0
"Recombinant IFN-alpha in lymphomas. The effectiveness of interferon (IFN) therapy in malignant lymphoma is analyzed in this review. Although various treatment regimens including IFN at various dose levels have so far not proved to have curative potential, a substantial palliative effect has been noted in hairy-cell leukemia and in some non-Hodgkin lymphomas of low-grade malignancy. Early stages of lymphoma disease are more responsive to IFN therapy, and this holds true also for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, in which IFN treatment is usually not effective in progressed disease after chemotherapy. Concepts of early-phase treatment and of remission maintenance by using IFN therapy are discussed on the basis of the data from several studies. ",0
"Relief of tracheal compression by aortopexy. We have performed aortopexy in 12 children with tracheal compression. Six infants had compression secondary to a vascular anomaly (group 1), and the other 6 had previous repair of esophageal atresia (group 2). Eleven of the 12 children are alive after a mean follow-up of 36 months. In group 1, 1 patient died and 3 patients (50%) experienced recurrent respiratory distress. Five infants sustained a major postoperative complication, and the average postoperative hospital stay was 25 days. In group 2, however, aortopexy was uniformly successful. There were no deaths, no postoperative complications, and no cases of postoperative respiratory distress, and the mean postoperative hospital stay was only 10 days. For children with reflex apnea after repair of esophageal atresia, aortopexy is lifesaving and can be performed with minimal morbidity and mortality. Great caution is indicated in children with tracheal compression from other causes. ",0
"Intracranial complications of paranasal sinusitis: a combined institutional review. Intracranial complications of paranasal sinusitis constitute true surgical and medical emergencies. The charts of all patients (n = 649) admitted for acute or chronic sinusitis to the University of Minnesota Hospital and to the University of Michigan Medical Center during a 13-year period (1975 to 1988) were retrospectively reviewed to determine the incidence of complications. The clinical presentation, bacteriology, involved sinuses, influencing host factors, white blood cell count on presentation, length of hospitalization, and postinterventional complications are presented. Twenty-four patients with intracranial complications from paranasal sinusitis are studied for an incidence of 3.7%. Aggressive medical and semi-emergent surgical intervention are required to prevent excessive morbidity and/or mortality. Intracranial complications included subdural empyema, frontal lobe abscesses, intrahemispheric abscesses, cavernous and superior sagittal sinus thrombosis, and osteomyelitis. ",0
"Current trends in suture fixation of posterior chamber intraocular lenses. Corneal surgeons were surveyed with regard to their technique of suture fixation of posterior chamber intraocular lenses in the absence of posterior capsular support. Fifty-nine percent of the 260 respondents stated they perform the procedure almost exclusively during penetrating keratoplasty. Scleral fixation was marginally favored over iris fixation by these surgeons. Most intraoperative problems reported were related to the relative technical difficulty of the procedure, although transient hemorrhage from the ciliary body was also mentioned. Postoperative complications cited included mechanical problems involving the lens and iris, cystoid macular edema, glaucoma, and endophthalmitis. ",0
"Clinical recognition and evaluation of peptic ulcer disease. When a patient has epigastric pain that worsens 1 to 3 hours after meals, the possibility of peptic ulcer disease should be considered. Completely typical clinical presentations in patients younger than age 50 justify empirical therapy when no physical or laboratory findings suggest a mimicking disorder. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy should be undertaken when response to therapy is incomplete, symptoms recur quickly, or dyspeptic symptoms present for the first time in a patient older than age 50. When gastric ulcers are diagnosed radiographically, endoscopy and biopsy at multiple sites should be done to exclude malignant disease. Intractable duodenal ulcers may necessitate endoscopic biopsy of antral and duodenal mucosa to rule out an associated Helicobacter pylori infection, which may modify therapeutic approaches. Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is rare but should be suspected when ulcer disease presents atypically or aggressively or in families. Diagnosis is not difficult to confirm. ",0
"Social environment and social support. Research on the relevance of social support to cancer has been plentiful since the first American Cancer Society workshop on methodological issues in behavioral and psychosocial science. Nonetheless, critical shortcomings continue to characterize the attempt empirically to establish such things as the extent to which social support predicts adjustment to cancer diagnosis and treatment. Prominent among these is the failure to adequately address large elements of the social structure, such as social class and urbanization, and to investigate how they shape the well being of persons with or at risk for cancer and their caregivers. We recommend that more psychosocial research on the link between social support and cancer be conducted within populations beset by poverty and without adequate access to health care. Funding is needed for the training and maintenance of multidisciplinary and multicultural teams of researchers working within community-based organizations and hospitals serving the underserved. ",0
"Concurrence of malignant hyperthermia and congenital abnormalities. Two children about to undergo corrective surgery were required to be investigated for malignant hyperthermia (MH). These investigations arose out of concern by the anesthetist who had obtained a history of unexplained pyrexial reactions to anaesthetic in other members of the family. Because over the years we have encountered several children with multiple congenital abnormalities who have been found to be susceptible to MH, we stressed the advisability of biopsying not only the patient but also the patient's parents. Positive responses for MH were obtained in the patients and in one of the parents on each occasion. The hypothesis of intrauterine MH with its pharmacogenetic propensity for heat production is considered as a possible etiological factor which may cause abnormalities of a congenital nature. ",0
"Pharmacologic treatment of noncognitive behavioral disturbances in elderly demented patients. Fifty-nine elderly residents of long-term care facilities who had DSM-III diagnoses of dementia were studied in an 8-week randomized, double-blind comparison trial of haloperidol, oxazepam, and diphenhydramine to test the efficacy of these agents in the treatment of clinically significant behavioral disturbances in patients with dementia. All three agents demonstrated modest but significant efficacy as measured by clinician ratings of agitated behavior and activities of daily living. The absolute magnitude of improvement was greater for haloperidol and diphenhydramine than for oxazepam, but differences among groups did not approach statistical significance. Frequencies of acute adverse events during the trial were similar across the drug treatment groups. Although these drugs may differ in terms of long-term safety and efficacy, they appear to be equivalent for short-term management of agitated behavior in severely demented patients. ",0
"Metastatic carcinoma of the gallbladder from renal cancer presenting as intraluminal polypoid mass. We report a rare case of secondary involvement of the gallbladder by metastatic renal cell carcinoma. A 71-year-old man was diagnosed as having a polypoid mass within the gallbladder when he underwent right nephrectomy for a renal cell carcinoma. A preoperative diagnosis of simultaneous carcinoma of the gallbladder was made, and extended cholecystectomy with regional lymphadenectomy was performed five months after the initial operation. Postoperative histological examination of the polypoid mass within the gallbladder and a pancreatic mass excised during the second surgery revealed these resected tumors to be identical to the clear cell type of renal cell carcinoma. We feel that this case presents synchronous involvement of the gallbladder and pancreas by metastatic renal cell carcinoma of the right kidney. ",0
Vitamin B12 and folate concentrations in serum and cerebrospinal fluid of neurological patients with special reference to multiple sclerosis and dementia. Vitamin B12 and folate concentrations were measured in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in 293 neurological patients. Serum and CSF vitamin B12 concentrations showed a positive correlation. In individual patients CSF B12 concentrations varied considerably for a given serum concentration. The median serum vitamin B12 concentration of the Alzheimer's type dementia group was significantly lower compared with that of a control group. Lower median CSF vitamin B12 concentrations were found in groups of patients with multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's type dementia. Five patients with heterogeneous clinical pictures had unexplained low serum and CSF B12 concentrations without macrocytosis. Two patients had very high serum B12 and low-normal CSF concentrations which could be explained by a blood-brain barrier transport defect. Serum and CSF folate concentrations did not show significant differences between the various groups. ,0
"Cavernous malformations and capillary telangiectasia: a spectrum within a single pathological entity. Cerebral vascular malformations have traditionally been divided into four categories: arteriovenous, venous, cavernous, and capillary telangiectases. A controversy exists about separating the latter two lesions into separate entities. Critics claim the distinction is arbitrary but have been unable to present convincing evidence linking the two types of lesions. We have reviewed the histories of 20 patients with cavernous malformations and have analyzed the clinical, radiographic, and surgical-autopsy data associated with these lesions. In some patients, multiple lesions, including cavernous malformations, capillary telangiectases, and transitional forms between the two, were identified. Based on this analysis, we conclude that capillary telangiectasia and cavernous malformations represent two pathological extremes within the same vascular malformation category and propose grouping them as a single cerebral entity called cerebral capillary malformations.

"Interleukin-8 production in red blood cell incompatibility. Hemolytic transfusion reactions (HTR) are characterized by fever, shock, organ system failure, intravascular coagulation, and possibly death. The same findings may be associated with sepsis. Neutrophils have been implicated in the pathogenesis of HTR, although a mechanism for neutrophil activation has not been shown. In addition, the possible role that cytokines may play in HTR has not been investigated. We show that interleukin-8 (IL-8), a cytokine with chemotactic and neutrophil-activation properties, is produced in whole blood following addition of ABO-incompatible red blood cells, in a dose- and time-dependent manner related to the degree of hemolysis, and is inhibited by inactivation of complement. IL-8 production is accompanied by increased gene expression in the buffy coat. This observation has implications for the understanding of the pathogenesis of and for the treatment of HTR. ",0
"Adenocarcinoma of the prostate in a 41-year-old man with XXY karyotype and chronic lymphocytic leukemia: report of a case. We report a case of adenocarcinoma of the prostate in a 41-year-old man with 47XXY karyotype (Klinefelter's syndrome) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The increased incidence of malignancy in individuals with Klinefelter's syndrome has been well documented for certain neoplasms. Adenocarcinoma of the prostate has not been reported previously in a patient with Klinefelter's syndrome and a 47XXY karyotype. Absence of mosaicism was confirmed by peripheral lymphocyte, skin fibroblast, bone marrow cell and spleen stroma fibroblast cultures. Chronic lymphocyte leukemia, especially the T-cell cytotoxic/suppressive variant, may additionally add to an immunological deficit. Since carcinoma of the prostate, Klinefelter's syndrome and chronic lymphocytic leukemia are common, the lack of a previous report is interesting. Etiological aspects are discussed. ",0
"Non-vesicular release of glutamate from glial cells by reversed electrogenic glutamate uptake. Glutamate uptake into nerve and glial cells usually functions to keep the extracellular glutamate concentration low in the central nervous system. But one component of glutamate release from neurons is calcium-independent, suggesting a non-vesicular release that may be due to a reversal of glutamate uptake. The activity of the electrogenic glutamate uptake carrier can be monitored by measuring the membrane current it produces, and uptake is activated by intracellular potassium ions. Here we report that raising the potassium concentration around glial cells evokes an outward current component produced by reversed glutamate uptake. This current is activated by intracellular glutamate and sodium, inhibited by extracellular glutamate and sodium, and increased by membrane depolarization. These results demonstrate a non-vesicular mechanism for the release of glutamate from glial cells and neurons. This mechanism may contribute to the neurotoxic rise in extracellular glutamate concentration during brain anoxia. ",0
"Mechanism of fibrous capsule formation surrounding hepatocellular carcinoma. Immunohistochemical study. In 14 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma with capsule, we studied the mechanism of capsule formation by the immunoperoxidase technique using antibodies to types I, III, and IV collagen, antilaminin antibody, and anti-prolyl hydroxylase antibody. Marked round cell infiltration was observed in the noncancerous side of the capsule and around compressed hepatocytes near the capsule. Thin capsules were composed primarily of type III collagen produced by an increased number of fibroblasts, transitional Ito cells, and hepatocytes near the capsule. In thickened capsules, the noncancerous side consisted primarily of type III collagen and the cancerous side of types I and III collagen. Type I as well as type III collagen was produced by fibroblasts, transitional Ito cells, and hepatocytes. The capsule thus formed is suggested to be part of the defense mechanisms against the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma. ",0
"Immunopathology of olfactory mucosa following injury to the olfactory bulb. Removal of the olfactory bulb was performed on rats in an attempt to elucidate the processes of olfactory dysfunction following head injury. Degeneration and regeneration of the olfactory mucosa were examined, histopathologically and immunohistochemically. We used antisera to olfactory marker protein (OMP) and neuron specific enolase (NSE) as a marker of the mature olfactory receptor neurons. Following rapid degeneration after bulbectomy, the olfactory receptor neurons regenerated. OMP and NSE containing cells re-appeared 49 days later. However, the cell population of the neuroepithelium did not revert to the numbers observed in the non-operated neuroepithelium, even three months later. The lack of a connection between regenerated axons and the olfactory bulb may result in immature neuronal replacement and reduce the number of olfactory receptor neurons. ",0
"Eosinophil activation in systemic sclerosis. Circulating levels of eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) were increased 4-fold in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) compared with those in healthy control subjects. There was no correlation between the ECP concentrations and laboratory indices of inflammatory activity or visceral involvement. Mean ECP levels were higher in patients with a history of occupational exposure to silica, even though patients who had no such history also had ECP levels higher than normal. The patients had increased bronchoalveolar levels of ECP, which correlated with impaired lung functioning. Skin infiltration with activated eosinophils and extracellular deposits of ECP were present in skin biopsy samples from the SSc patients. We conclude that eosinophil activation is part of the inflammatory process in SSc. ",0
"The role of antihistamines in the treatment of chronic urticaria. For many years, H1 antihistamines have been the primary management option for urticaria. However, undesirable side effects, particularly daytime sedation, have limited the usefulness of these classic antihistamines. A new class of peripherally acting, nonsedating antihistamines (e.g., terfenadine, astemizole, loratadine, and cetirizine) has proved to have clinical efficacy comparable with the classic antihistamines. In comparative trials between the various nonsedating agents, no significant difference in efficacy has been noted. All these agents have good safety profiles, although astemizole use has been correlated with increased appetite and weight gain in some patients, and cetirizine has caused slightly increased sedative effects compared with placebo. Although H1/H2 antihistamine combinations have been proposed as possible treatments for urticaria, studies have produced mixed results. ",0
"Erythrocyte polyamine levels in human prostatic carcinoma. Abnormally high red blood cell polyamine levels were found in benign prostatic hyperplasia and in prostatic adenocarcinoma patients. In prostatic adenocarcinoma patients a relationship was noted between the importance of red blood cell spermidine and spermine concentrations, and the clinical stage of the disease (Whitmore classification). Considering prostatic adenocarcinoma patient populations, patients with metastases (groups 3 and 4) statistically differed from those without metastases (group 2). Furthermore, red blood cell polyamine level determination discriminated patients in the hormonal escape group (group 4) from those usually considered as hormone responsive (groups 2 and 3). No statistically significant correlation was observed between red blood cell polyamine levels and usual tumor markers (prostatic acid phosphatase and prostate specific antigen). These results confirmed that red blood cell polyamine levels must be considered as a circulating index of cell proliferation that might be of clinical importance during the long-term followup and treatment of prostatic adenocarcinoma patients.

"High urinary cAMP in hypertensives despite careful drug treatment--an epidemiological study from the Dalby population. The correlation between serum calcium (S-Ca), plasma parathyroid hormone (P-PTH) and hypertension was determined in a population-based, cross-sectional study of carefully treated hypertensives (n = 391; diastolic blood pressure 90.2 mmHg; 57 years) compared with normotensive controls (n = 328; diastolic blood pressure 82.1 mmHg; 57 years). Levels of urinary cyclic-adenosinemonophosphate (U-cAMP), but not of plasma cAMP (P-cAMP), were higher (P less than 0.001) in hypertensives than in controls. This was the case regardless of the type of drug treatment and the blood pressure level that was reached. U-cAMP correlated with adrenaline in multivariate analyses. S-Ca levels were higher (P less than 0.001) and S-Mg levels were lower (P less than 0.001) in hypertensives than in controls. This was not explained by thiazide treatment. Thus, despite 'adequate' blood pressure reduction, substantial differences in S-Ca, S-Mg and U-cAMP still exist between hypertensives and normotensive controls. ",0
"Injuries to the cervical spine causing vertebral artery trauma: case reports. In four patients with lesions of the vertebral artery resulting from cervical spine injury, two were due to unilateral facet dislocation and two to fractures of the dens. There was one arterial occlusion with minor vertebrobasilar symptoms, and an arterial lesion with thrombosis causing embolic occlusion of the basilar artery with lethal outcome. In one patient a fresh fracture of the dens caused dislocation of C1/2 with reversible occlusion of the left and stenosis of the right vertebral artery, resulting in unconsciousness. In a patient with pseudarthrosis of the dens an aneurysm of the vertebral artery could be detected. Cerebellar or cerebral symptoms associated with cervical spine injury should be investigated by vertebral angiography because vertebral arterial injury may be more common than suspected and may simulate traumatic brain damage.

"Multipiece tire rim injuries. Multipiece tire rims can explode during tire change, causing severe injury. Although more than 450 such accidents, with at least 80 deaths, have been recorded by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), we found no reports in the surgical literature on such injuries in the United States. This report describes experience with seven patients who sustained injuries in explosions of multipiece tire rims. All victims suffered massive maxillofacial trauma with associated ocular, cranial, intracranial, and extremity injuries. Two patients died, both because of intracerebral hemorrhage. One patient suffered serious long-term disability. All survivors required extensive reconstructive surgery. The design of the multipiece tire rim is inherently hazardous. Since many accidents of this type are not reported to the NHTSA, the incidence of such injuries may be significantly higher. An alternative, nonhazardous tire rim is available. Design modifications or a law restricting use of multipiece tire rims would prevent many accidents. ",0
"Defective jejunal brush border membrane sodium/proton exchange in association with lethal familial protracted diarrhoea. The spectrum of clinical disease associated with specific defects in jejunal brush border membrane sodium/proton exchange is poorly defined and only two patients have been described so far. Jejunal brush border membrane transport studies were performed in a boy who presented with lethal familial protracted diarrhoea in the first few days of life. Using jejunal brush border membrane vesicles prepared from conventional jejunal biopsy specimens, initial sodium uptake under H+ gradient conditions was found to be only 6% of the mean control value. In contrast, sodium stimulated glucose uptake was normal. Our data confirm the importance of a congenital defect in this exchanger as a cause of severe sodium-losing diarrhoea and extend the spectrum of disorders characterised by a specific defect in brush border membrane Na+/H+ exchange to include some forms of lethal familial protracted diarrhoea.

"The cutaneous manifestations in children with familial Mediterranean fever (recurrent hereditary polyserositis). A six-year study. In a six-year study of 46 children with familial Mediterranean fever (recurrent hereditary polyserositis), 20 children (43 per cent) developed cutaneous manifestations. Ten children had 18 episodes of erysipelas-like erythema which proved to be specific for the disease. Twelve children (26 per cent) had 31 episodes of non-specific purpuric rash and six children (13 per cent) had nine episodes of Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Other manifestations included diffuse erythema of the face, and/or trunk, angioneurotic oedema, diffuse erythema of the palms and soles followed by mild desquamation of the skin, Raynaud's phenomenon and a subcutaneous nodule. The mean frequency of the cutaneous lesions was 1.6/patient/year before colchicine therapy and 0.4/patient/year after colchicine therapy (p = 0.0005). The high incidence of cutaneous manifestations and their response to colchicine strongly suggest that skin involvement is an integral part familial Mediterranean fever. ",0
"Morphological features of blood access stenosis and results of noninvasive angioplasty. We investigated a connection between the results of noninvasive angioplasty for the blood access stenosis and its morphological features in 37 dialysis cases. In 3 cases presenting stenosis in the original artery, the area could not be dilated by noninvasive techniques. In 4 cases with stenosis in the arterialized vein downstream of the needle insertion points for extracorporeal circulation, 3 showed long-term dilatation by the procedures. In 30 cases having stenosis upstream of the points, 16 showed long-term dilatation. In the unsuccessful cases, the angle formed between the axes of the stenosed portion and the normal vessel was over 39 degrees, and the distance between the anastomosis and the stenosed portion was less than 11 mm.

"Diclofenac-associated hepatotoxicity Diclofenac sodium, a phenylacetic acid-derived nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) recently released in the United States, was associated with the development of significant hepatitis in seven patients, with one associated death. Signs and symptoms developed within several weeks of initiation of drug use and generally resolved 4 to 6 weeks following discontinuation of use of the drug. The only patient rechallenged with the drug developed a recurrence of her hepatic abnormalities. In one patient, fatal, fulminant hepatitis developed despite early withdrawal of the drug. Review of the European literature disclosed three additional fatalities associated with diclofenac therapy. It is unclear whether the incidence of hepatotoxicity is higher with this drug compared with other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Careful patient monitoring is advised, and prompt discontinuation of the drug is suggested when signs or symptoms of liver disease develop. ",0
"Bicarbonate-buffered lidocaine-epinephrine-hyaluronidase for eyelid anesthesia. A double-masked, randomized clinical trial was conducted to determine if subcutaneous eyelid injections of a bicarbonate-buffered lidocaine-epinephrine-hyaluronidase mixture were less painful than unbuffered injections. Twenty-one patients received both buffered (pH = 7.4) and unbuffered (pH = 4.6) injections. After each injection, patients recorded pain on a scale of 0, ""no pain,"" to 10, ""severe pain."" Mean pain score for buffered injections was 2.0 versus 4.1 for unbuffered injections (P = 0.0003). Seventeen (81%) of 21 patients ranked the buffered injection less painful. Use of a bicarbonate-buffered lidocaine-epinephrine-hyaluronidase mixture is effective in making ophthalmic anesthesia less painful. ",0
"The papillary-cystic neoplasm of the pancreas. An increasingly recognized clinicopathologic entity. The clinical course of the papillary-cystic neoplasm of the pancreas is contrasted with that of the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The former occurs predominantly in young women, has a low malignant potential, and is highly curable with surgical treatment. Three cases are reported that illustrate the typical clinical features and the indolent nature of the tumor. One case was discovered after blunt abdominal trauma resulted in rupture of the tumor and hemoperitoneum. All cases were treated by pancreatic resection with preservation of the spleen, an important consideration in younger patients. All patients were free of disease at long-term follow-up. Increasing awareness of this tumor has resulted in the reclassification of several tumors and should lead to better recognition by surgeons caring for patients with pancreatic diseases. ",0
"Iatrogenic illness in pediatric critical care. Iatrogenic illness may be an important determinant of the need for pediatric intensive care. We prospectively evaluated consecutive admissions to a pediatric ICU (PICU) over two time periods totaling 6 months. Twenty-five (4.6%) admissions were necessitated by iatrogenic illnesses. Drug-induced conditions accounted for eight (32%) of the iatrogenic patients, and complications of medical-surgical acts accounted for 17 (68%). Diagnoses included six respiratory failures due to seizure medications, six chronic upper airway complications of neonatal intensive care, four posttonsillectomy and postadenoidectomy complications, two chronic postcardiac surgery complications, two cardiac catheterization complications, and five miscellaneous conditions. One (3.7%) patient with iatrogenic illness died. As a group, patients with iatrogenic illness were at a risk of dying similar to other patients. We conclude that iatrogenic illness is a significant cause of PICU admission. ",0
"Endothelial markers in malignant vascular tumours of the liver: superiority of QB-END/10 over von Willebrand factor and Ulex europaeus agglutinin 1. A new monoclonal antibody, QB-END/10, raised against the CD34 antigen in human endothelial cell membranes and haemopoietic progenitor cells, was studied for its usefulness as a marker of neoplastic vascular cells in 21 angiosarcomas and seven malignant haemangioendotheliomas of the liver. QB-END/10 was both more sensitive and more specific than Von Willebrand factor (VWF) and Ulex europaeus 1 agglutinin (UEA-1) in labelling endothelial cells and it did not cross react with epithelia as UEA-1 often does. Staining was uniformly strong and clear in all histological variants of these two tumours. QB-END/10 should prove particularly useful in the differential diagnosis of malignant vascular tumours of the liver. ",0
"Muscle involvement in the scleroderma syndromes. Muscle involvement was identified in 14 patients with scleroderma or a connective tissue disease overlap syndrome with predominant features of scleroderma. Patients presented with symmetrical proximal weakness indistinguishable from other inflammatory myopathies. Creatine kinase and electromyography were useful to demonstrate muscle involvement. Muscle histopathology demonstrated primarily the vasculopathy of scleroderma or polymyositis in similar numbers of patients. Scleroderma vasculopathy and polymyositis generally occur without specificity to diffuse scleroderma, the calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, telangiectasia syndrome, or an overlap syndrome with arthritis. Polymyositis also occurs when the vasculopathy of scleroderma involves other organ systems. ",0
"Acute porphyria presenting with hyperamylasemia. An elevation of serum amylase and lipase has not been reported previously to occur with porphyria. In this report, we describe a patient who presented with the clinical and laboratory picture of pancreatitis: elevated amylase, lipase, amylase-creatinine clearance ratio, and with abdominal pain. Only after extensive evaluation, was the patient found to have porphyria. On two separate occasions, with hematin therapy, her serum amylase decreased, as did her clinical symptoms of porphyria and her urinary quantitative porphyrins. This suggests an association between elevation of the serum amylase and lipase with acute porphyria. Moreover, this association can lead to delay in establishing the diagnosis of acute porphyria. ",0
Study of preneoplastic changes of liver cells by immunohistochemical and molecular hybridization techniques. The status of hepatitis B virus DNA was investigated by in situ hybridization in multifocal areas of a noncancerous hepatitis B virus-associated cirrhosis. This liver exhibited a marked degree of dysplasia and adenomatous hyperplasia. The results of these studies were correlated with the histopathology and immunohistochemical stains for hepatitis B core and surface antigens. There was clear evidence of a marked reduction to absence of hepatitis B viral DNA by in situ hybridization and absence of HBc and HBsAg in the foci of liver cell dysplasia and adenomatous hyperplasia. These results support the hypothesis that liver cell dysplasia and adenomatous hyperplasia are preneoplastic in nature. ,0
"Differential reading recovery in patients with severe to moderate closed head injury. A differential recovery was seen when alternate forms of a nationally standardized test of Reading Vocabulary, Literal Reading Comprehension and Inferential Reading Comprehension was administered serially to 10 consecutive closed head injury admissions to a university rehabilitation hospital. Inferential Reading Comprehension was the most impaired and had the fastest recovery rate. Subtle cognitive deficits in Inferential Reading Comprehension were detected when Reading Vocabulary was at or better than a twelfth grade level. Maximal recovery of all three reading functions occurred within 4 months after trauma, with most occurring in the first 3 months. The reading recovery pattern parallels the recovery of intelligence scores in the literature. ",0
"Interferon alpha and etretinate combination treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Eleven patients suffering from cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides) were treated with recombinant interferon alpha-2A in combination (seven patients) or alone. Two patients, one in combined treatment, went into clinical complete remission, and five experienced partial remission. Two patients progressed during therapy, and two were nonevaluable because they stopped treatment early due to side effects. Dosages of interferon were from 3 to 36 million units daily for 3 months, and thereafter 3 times weekly. Etretinate (0.7 mg/kg) was given orally. The study showed that recombinant interferon alpha-2A in combination with etretinate or alone can induce remission of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. ",0
"Early scintigraphic detection of experimental myocardial infarction in dogs with technetium-99m-glucaric acid Recent data have generated some interest in technetium-99m-(99mTc) glucaric acid as an in vivo viability marker. We studied 99mTc-glucaric acid retention in canine models of myocardial ischemia (20-min occlusion of the LAD/40-min reperfusion), acute myocardial infarction (MI) (90-min LAD occlusion/3-hr reperfusion), and chronic MI (90-min occlusion and either 48-hr or 10-day reperfusion). Regional myocardial blood flow was measured by radiolabeled microspheres. No preferential uptake of glucaric acid was observed in ischemic but viable myocardium. The compound showed high affinity for necrotic myocardial tissue for several days following injury. The preferential uptake in infarcted tissue disappeared by 10 days following injury. This study shows that 99mTc-glucaric acid acts exclusively as a marker of necrosis in canine models of MI. Technetium-99m-glucaric acid may have clinical utility in early cardiac imaging of myocardial infarction and in differentiating recent from old injuries. ",0
"Elevated serum bromide concentrations following repeated halothane anaesthesia in a child. A 20-month-old child received 25 brief halothane general anaesthetics over a five-week period to allow cranial irradiation treatments for a posterior fossa ependymoma. Personality change during the last week of the treatment protocol raised the question of possible bromide intoxication. Serum bromide concentrations, using a gold chloride assay technique, were monitored at that time, and at four- and six-week intervals thereafter. Serum bromide concentrations demonstrated a four-fold change during this period ranging from peak levels of 2.2 mEq.L-1 (176 micrograms.kg-1) during the fifth week of treatment decreasing to less than 0.5 mEq.L-1 (less than 40 micrograms.ml-1) six weeks following the end of treatments. This demonstrates the possibility for repetitive, short halothane exposures to result in elevations of serum bromide and the potential of bromide intoxication in paediatric neuro-oncology patients.

"Selective nonoperative management of patients referred with abnormal mammograms. Screening mammography provides a means of detecting clinically occult breast carcinoma, but the question of whether all abnormal mammograms require biopsy remains unanswered. We retrospectively reviewed records of 214 women referred over an 8-year period for abnormal mammograms. They were selectively assigned to biopsy or mammographic follow-up based on specific mammographic criteria. Of 114 women initially observed mammographically, 2 were later found by biopsy to have carcinoma. Initial assignment to mammographic observation delayed the recommendation for biopsy 3 and 12 months, respectively, in these patients, but no effect on outcome was documented. Because they have benign lesions by clinical and mammographic criteria, 102 women (53%) have been spared biopsy; they continue to be monitored closely. We believe these data support the use of a selective approach to biopsy based on specific mammographic criteria. ",0
"Peritoneal mesothelioma: an unusual cause of esophageal achalasia. Secondary esophageal achalasia due to malignancy is a rare condition; only 53 such cases have been reported to date. Sixty-two percent of the cases were due to gastric adenocarcinoma. Mesothelioma of the peritoneum is an uncommon neoplasm. The usual presenting symptoms are abdominal pain, abdominal mass, or abdominal distention. The patient we are reporting had peritoneal mesothelioma which presented with dysphagia and weight loss, in addition to the radiological and manometric picture of achalasia. Secondary achalasia was suspected clinically, and was confirmed by computed tomography and laparotomy. The diagnosis of peritoneal mesothelioma was made only by histopathological examination. We are not aware of any other report documenting the association of peritoneal mesothelioma and achalasia. ",0
"Effect of vaginal delivery on the pelvic floor: a 5-year follow-up. We have studied the pelvic floor musculature and its innervation in 14 of 24 (58 per cent) multiparous women who had been recruited into a study of the effect of childbirth on the pelvic floor as part of a prospective investigation that began in 1983. These 24 women had all delivered by the vaginal route without forceps assistance. Five of the 14 had developed clinical symptoms of stress incontinence 5 years later; two of them had had a further uncomplicated vaginal delivery during this time. There was manometric and neurophysiological evidence of weakness because of partial denervation of the pelvic floor striated sphincter musculature, with pudendal neuropathy, which was more marked in those women with incontinence. These findings provide direct evidence for the hypothesis that pudendal neuropathy due to vaginal delivery persists and may worsen with time. ",0
"Detection of anti-Epstein-Barr virus trans-activator (ZEBRA) antibodies in sera from patients with human immunodeficiency virus. Patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex often show symptoms of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation. Several EBV-encoded trans-acting factors activate the EBV lytic cycle, and one, ZEBRA (BamHI Z EBV replication activator; also called EB1), switches EBV from its latent to productive cycle. Indirect immunofluorescence studies were done using human cells transfected with a recombinant DNA-harboring cDNA sequence spanning BZLF1 (BamHI Z left frame 1) that was inserted downstream of the adenovirus major late promoter. IgG anti-ZEBRA antibodies were detected in a high proportion of asymptomatic HIV carriers and in AIDS patients but were absent in healthy control individuals. The presence of anti-ZEBRA antibodies in the sera of HIV-positive patients favors the hypothesis that EBV reactivates in such subjects. This finding may be of practical importance in the prognostication of AIDS development. ",0
"Severe cerebral and systemic necrotizing vasculitis developing during pregnancy in a case of systemic lupus erythematosus. We describe a fatal case of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) developing cerebral and systemic necrotizing vasculitis during pregnancy. The patient was discovered to have SLE at 14 weeks' gestation. Although the symptoms disappeared without treatment with corticosteroid in the 2nd trimester, she presented with meningoencephalitis due to vasculitis in the 3rd trimester. Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN)-like necrotizing vasculitis of the small muscular arteries and arterioles, with acute and healing lesions in the leptomeninges, brain parenchyma and visceral organs was observed at postpartum autopsy. PAN-like vasculitis in the central nervous system is quite rare in SLE. This case is also suggestive in terms of the influence of pregnancy on the activity of SLE. ",0
"Variceal rebleeding after portosystemic shunting. Strategies and solutions to a vexing problem. The purpose of this review was to discuss an approach to the treatment of recurrent bleeding from esophageal or gastric varices after portosystemic shunt. From our own clinical experience, as well as that of others, it appears that re-establishment of portal decompression should offer the best chance at long-term survival. Luckily, innovations in angiographic technique have allowed attainment of this goal without the inordinate risk of an operative procedure. However, not all patients' situations will be amenable to such treatment. For some of them, operative decompression of the portal venous system can be carried out in an anatomic area previously untouched. For those patients in whom no decompression is possible, direct endoscopic treatment of the varices will offer an alternative, albeit temporizing, approach. ",0
"Decalcification of a choroidal osteoma. A 56-year-old man presented with a clearly defined orange tumour in the posterior pole of his left eye. A choroidal osteoma was suspected, and ultrasonography confirmed the diagnosis. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated subretinal neovascularisation on the nasal edge of the tumour, which was treated with krypton laser photocoagulation twice. Recurrent subretinal neovascularisation occurred one year later and was not amenable to treatment. Three years after the patient first presented, thinning of the tumour was noted on follow-up examination. During the next 15 months the tumour completely disappeared, leaving an area of retinal pigment epithelial and choroidal atrophy. Total decalcification of the choroidal osteoma was demonstrated by ultrasonography. ",0
"Delayed chest wall pain due to sternal wire sutures. This report describes 18 patients with disabling chest wall pain due to one or more sternal wire sutures. The pain occurred from 2 to 84 months after a median sternotomy. The pain was described either as sharp and stabbing or as a deep-seated ache. The involved wires had an exaggerated fibrous tissue reaction surrounding the twisted portion. The adjacent noninvolved wires had minimal reaction. In the last 7 patients, serial sections of the fibrous tissue revealed entrapment of one or more sensory nerve fibers. In 6 of the 7 electrical potentials were measured and found to be elevated, indicating wire damage during twisting. Ferroxyl tests confirmed the collection of iron ions at this anodic point as a result of corrosion. Removal of the involved wires and the fibrous tissue surrounding this anodic point relieved the symptoms of pain and tenderness resulting from entrapped sensory nerves. ",0
"Sensory ataxic hemiparesis in thalamic hemorrhage. Ataxic hemiparesis with cerebellar-like features has been reported following infarction or hemorrhage of the thalamus. We describe five patients with incoordination and corticospinal tract signs in the limbs opposite a dorsolateral thalamic hemorrhage. In four patients the hemorrhage extended superiorly into the lateral ventricle, the adjacent paraventricular region, and the upper and medial parts of the posterior limb of the internal capsule. Instead of cerebellar dysfunction, these patients exhibited directional errors of movement that improved distinctly when performed under visual guidance. We explain the incoordination on the basis of conscious deep sensory loss in the involved limbs. Perception of light touch, painful pinprick, and temperature were preserved in all patients. We use the term ""sensory ataxic hemiparesis"" to distinguish these patients from those with ""classic"" ataxic hemiparesis and cerebellar-like features, a distinction that may be important when planning functional rehabilitation.

"Cruciate paralysis: a clinical and radiographic analysis of injuries to the cervicomedullary junction. Fourteen patients with superior cervical spinal cord injuries and the clinical signs and symptoms of cruciate paralysis are presented. This rare injury pattern is characterized by weakness of the upper extremities with little or no compromise of lower-extremity function following trauma to the superior spinal cord. Anatomically, cruciate paralysis is thought to represent selective injury to descending corticospinal tracts as they decussate at the cervicomedullary junction. The clinical and radiographic findings of each patient are outlined and the incidence and natural history of the injury syndrome, including a review of the literature, are presented. ",0
"Outpatient microsurgical reversal of tubal sterilization by a combined approach of laparoscopy and minilaparotomy. A prospective study of 17 cases of microsurgical reversal of tubal sterilization by a combined approach of laparoscopy and minilaparotomy was performed. Inclusion criteria included age less than 43; weight less than ideal body weight plus 20%; documentation of ovulation; 2 cm of proximal oviduct on hysterosalpingography; and a normal semen analysis or postcoital test. A comparison group of the 5 cases of sterilization reversal performed by a standard inpatient technique during the same period was analyzed. The study technique was performed on an outpatient basis in 15 of the 17 cases, 12 patients (71%) conceived 13 intrauterine pregnancies, one ectopic pregnancy occurred, and total patient costs and time until return to work were significantly less with the study versus standard technique.

"Iatrogenic saphenous neuralgia: successful therapy with neuroma resection. We report the case of a patient with saphenous neuralgia secondary to iatrogenic trauma resulting from bypass surgery in the femoral-popliteal region. Early symptoms of this condition were medial calf and ankle pain, with no findings of motor and reflex abnormalities. Exploration of the thigh 2 years later revealed a neuroma of the nerve in the distal dissection site, medial to the knee. Resection of the neuroma alleviated this condition. It is noted that saphenous neuropathy is seen as a spontaneous entrapment syndrome as well as a complication of orthopedic and vascular procedures performed on the medial area of the knee. Saphenous neuralgia is often not recognized by neurosurgeons. If the condition is intractable, it does respond to surgical therapy. ",0
"Colorectal tumors: an in vitro study of high-resolution MR imaging. To study the potential utility of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in staging colorectal tumors, 15 resected colonic segments containing 17 elevated lesions were examined on a 1.5- or 1.9-T superconductive MR system. The whole intestinal wall was apparent as three or five layers on images obtained with a short repetition time (TR) and short echo time (TE) and as six or eight distinct layers, including the intestinal wall proper as well as an adherent mucus layer and an outer layer of pericolonic fat, on the long TR/TE images. In cases of colonic carcinoma, MR images correlated well with the pathologic findings, including the macroscopic growth pattern, depth of mural invasion, and the presence of foci of calcific tumor necrosis and pools of extracellular mucin (colloid). These features suggest that MR imaging may be valuable in the clinical evaluation of colorectal tumors. ",0
"Pancreatic ascites presenting in infancy, with review of the literature. We report a 4-month-old boy with massive ascites in whom a diagnosis of pancreatitis was made on a raised ascitic amylase level after two inconclusive laparotomies. He developed a pseudocyst which was managed with repeated percutaneous needle aspirations, nutrition being maintained intravenously. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) demonstrated a congenital intra-pancreatic cyst. He thrived after operation drainage for recurrent pseudocyst, but repeat ERCP shows that the cyst in the head of the pancreas remains. Pancreatic ascites is rare in children and diagnosis is frequently delayed. A third of reported cases in childhood present in the first year of life. A search for the underlying cause should include an ERCP to demonstrate abnormalities of the pancreaticobiliary ducts. ",0
"Characterization of rat hyperplastic bile ductular epithelial cells in culture and in vivo. A novel intrahepatic biliary cell culture/in vivo transplantation system has been developed with an essentially pure population of bile ductular epithelial cells isolated from rat liver 6-12 weeks after bile duct ligation. In primary culture, these cells retain staining strongly for gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase and glutathione S-transferase P. The cytoplasm of cultured bile ductular cells reacts with an anti-laminin antibody, but loses immunoreactivity with a monoclonal anti-cytokeratin 19 antibody. Semiconservative DNA synthesis in the cultured cells was dependent upon the continued presence of 10% fetal calf serum in the medium. Replicating bile ductular cells could be subcultured for a finite number of passages. In addition, freshly isolated bile ductular epithelial cells gave rise to well differentiated bile ductular structures when transplanted into the interscapular fat pads of syngeneic recipient rats.

"Failure of transluminal angioplasty in the treatment of myointimal hyperplasia of the internal carotid artery: case report. Recurrent stenosis of the carotid arteries after a carotid endarterectomy for atherosclerosis can occur as a result of myointimal hyperplasia. This condition was treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Excellent dilatation of the vessel lumen was documented after balloon dilatation. A 6-month follow-up angiographic study, however, demonstrated recurrent high-grade stenosis at the same level in both carotid arteries. Presumably, the failure of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and the treatment of myointimal hyperplasia of the internal carotid artery results in the same condition after the original endarterectomy, that is, additional myointimal hyperplasia.

"Hypertension, endothelium, and cardiovascular risk factors. The functions of the endothelium and the effects of hypertension, atherosclerosis, and diabetes on the endothelium are reviewed. The endothelium affects vascular tone by releasing vasodilators and modulating the effects of vasoactive substances such as catecholamines, bradykinin, serotonin, and angiotensin II. Relaxation of vascular smooth muscle depends upon a functionally intact endothelium and the release of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor nitric oxide. Endothelial cells also appear to release a hyperpolarizing factor that relaxes smooth muscle through activation of the sodium-potassium pump, and of the endothelium-dependent contracting factors. Similarities are found in the vascular injury resulting from hypertension, atherosclerosis, and diabetes. When these risk factors coexist, they can act synergistically and magnify the vascular injury. The endothelium appears to be one of the major targets for these forms of injury. Future therapeutic strategies will focus on ways to prevent, arrest, or reverse endothelial injury. ",0
Intra-abdominal abscesses in Crohn's disease. We reviewed 22 patients who had intra-abdominal abscesses secondary to Crohn's disease. A total of 29 abscesses were discovered. These included superficial and deep intraperitoneal as well as pelvic and retroperitoneal abscesses. Diagnosis was aided by ultrasound and computer tomographic scanning. Barium studies continue to play an important role in delineating the extent of bowel involvement and fistulization. Treatment varied depending on the location and size of the abscess. The need for ultimate bowel resection was determined in the majority of cases by the presence of fistulization between the abscess cavity and the bowel. The terminal ileum or neoterminal ileum were almost always involved. ,0
"Multiple myeloma and acute megakaryoblast leukemia in spent phase polycythemia vera. The spontaneous and simultaneous occurrence of multiple myeloma and megakaryoblast leukemia with myelodysplastic features in a case of spent phase polycythemia vera is well documented. In support of the morphologic characteristics of the bone marrow, immunocytologic studies show proliferation of monoclonal plasma cells and megakaryoblasts. The cytogenetic findings of 20q- and unbalanced t(1;7) are consistent with myelodysplastic and leukemic transformation of the bone marrow. These transformations expand observations on variable and spontaneous lineage commitments as the consequence of alterations of the hematopoietic stem cell clone. These data are in support of the changing insights in hematopoiesis as a process of ordered commitment of the stem cell with sequential lineage potentials. ",0
"Vitrectomy retinotomy aspiration biopsy of choroidal tumors We used an investigational technique for the biopsy of intraocular tumors to aid in the diagnosis of three choroidal tumors. A three-port trans-pars plana vitrectomy was performed in conjunction with retinotomy, tumor biopsy, endophotocoagulation, and air-fluid exchange. Vitrectomy was used to decrease the amount of traction secondary to retained vitreous after intraocular surgery. Retinotomy sites were chosen under microscopic control to avoid large caliber retinal vessels. Then a modified tumor-aspiration technique, together with endophotocoagulation and aspiration of intraoperative vitreous hemorrhages, provided an opportunity to sample tumor tissue continually at varied depths. We have added standard vitreous surgery concepts, techniques, and instrumentation to produce vitrectomy retinotomy aspiration biopsy of choroidal tumors. ",0
"Glucose polymers as an alternative to glucose in oral rehydration solutions. Several issues involving glucose-based oral rehydration therapy may limit its acceptability and sustained use. Our studies suggest that defined short-chain glucose polymers (2 to 9 glucose units) are hydrolyzed and absorbed faster than isocaloric solutions of D-glucose in the small intestine of the rat. Glucose polymers, primarily from rice-based solutions, have been shown to be as effective as glucose-based solutions. They offer additional advantages in reducing the amount and duration of diarrhea with lesser volumes of solution, thereby reducing the costs of treatment. Rice-based solutions provide high caloric density and increase the absorption of sodium without an osmotic overload. The result is increased net absorption of glucose, sodium, and water. Glucose polymers from rice or other starches in oral rehydration solutions may be effective, inexpensive, easily used, and safe treatments for acute diarrhea. ",0
"Nerve-muscle involvement in a large family with mitochondrial cytopathy: electrophysiological studies. Thirteen patients with mitochondrial cytopathy were investigated. They represent different generations, ages, stages, and severities of the disease. All were assumed to have the same metabolic defect. The disease is a multisystem disorder with a metabolic defect located at complex 1 in the respiratory chain. Clinically, the disorder gives symptoms such as hearing loss, retinal pigmental degeneration, ataxia, cardiomyopathy, muscular fatiguability and neuropathy. The patients were investigated with nerve conduction studies, concentric needle EMG, SFEMG, and macro EMG examinations. Neurophysiologic studies revealed signs of myopathy in both the younger members and in those with slight muscular symptoms. In the more advanced stages, neuropathic changes of the axonal type were seen as well. Macro EMG was interpreted as indicating muscle fiber membrane abnormalities in the early stages. Single fiber EMG studies indicate that this metabolic defect does not disturb neuromuscular transmission. ",0
"Mucosal characteristics of pelvic ileal pouches. This study aimed to investigate the degree of colonic metaplasia in ileo - anal pouches. Biopsy specimens from 25 patients with functioning pouches, eight of whom had pouchitis, were studied using routine histology, mucosal morphometry, mucin histochemistry, and immunoperoxidase staining with monoclonal antibodies directed towards a 40kD colonic protein and a small bowel specific disaccharidase-sucrase isomaltase. Thirteen patients (including all eight with pouchitis) had subtotal or total villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia. In this group, nine had colorectal type sulphomucin and the 40kD colonic protein was detected in two. These changes were not observed in patients with less severe villous abnormalities. Sucrase-isomaltase activity was, however, present in all 25 pouch specimens. We conclude that although some ileal pouches acquire certain colonic characteristics, complete colonic metaplasia does not occur. ",0
Nd:YAG-laser in the microsurgery of frontobasal meningiomas. Forty-three patients with big frontobasal meningiomas underwent a microsurgical removal of the tumor. The 1.32 microns Nd:YAG-laser has proved useful in this prospective series particularly with the contactless shrinkage of the tumors and the necrotization of the dural and bony attachments. Tumor shrinkage was achieved by radiating the tumor surface with the Nd:YAG-laser. This technique facilitated the microsurgical dissection and reduced the blood loss by half. The Nd:YAG-laser necrotization of the dural and bony attachments reduced the recurrence rate following grade two resections from 20% to zero. The postoperative quality of life was excellent with a complete rehabilitation in 76% of the patients. The use of the 1.32 microns Nd:YAG-laser improved significantly the results of microsurgery for frontobasal meningioma. ,0
"The effect of lateral tilt on maternal and fetal hemodynamic variables. We measured maternal blood pressure and heart rate, fetal heart rate, and umbilical artery velocity waveforms in 25 healthy women placed in the supine and in both right and left 5 degrees and 10 degrees lateral tilt positions. Although we found no significant difference among these variables in the various maternal positions, two of 25 women became hypotensive and symptomatic in the supine and 5 degrees tilt positions. Because we could not predict which women would become symptomatic, we recommend lateral tilt of all pregnant women during operative procedures beyond 20 weeks' gestation, including those in the lithotomy position for vaginal delivery.

"Conservation surgery for glomus jugulare tumors: the value of early diagnosis. The results of lateral cranial base surgery for glomus jugulare tumors are gratifying when normal anatomy and function can be preserved. The goal of conservation surgery is to preserve normal ear anatomy and cranial nerve function. In general, conservation surgery is tumor-size dependent. Thus, excellent states of functional recovery depend upon accurate early diagnosis. This paper reviews the technical aspects of transtemporal conservation skull base tumor surgery while also reviewing our experience with nearly 100 glomus jugulare patients. Adjuvants to early diagnosis will be highlighted from a review of presenting symptoms, clinical signs, and related diagnosis. Our objective is to provoke a high index of suspicion in physicians charged with the responsibility of diagnosing these tumors. Diagnostic guidelines are proposed. ",0
"The ileosigmoid knot. The ileosigmoid knot (ISK) is a rare cause of intestinal obstruction. Unfamiliarity with the condition could have disastrous consequence at surgery. Over the past 20 years, we have encountered seven cases. Analyzing the data gathered from these, and on reviewing the literature, we found it possible to arrive at a preoperative diagnosis in two patients. Four patients were women, two of whom developed the obstruction in the postpartum period. One of the males was found to have an inflamed Meckel's diverticulum included in the knotting. The symptoms and the clinical findings were nonspecific. The characteristic x-ray findings of a double closed loop obstruction, was seen in only three patients. Resection of gangrenous bowel with anastomoses was feasible in four. Unlike in other series, primary anastomosis of the large gut was undertaken. There were two deaths early in the series. Guidelines to the management have been suggested. ",0
"Superficial esophageal carcinoma. Surgical treatment and the results. We report 92 patients treated with esophagectomy for superficial esophageal carcinoma (SEC; 9.1% of all resected esophageal cancers at our institution). The operative mortality rate was 5.4%. In 24 cases, cancer invasion was limited to the mucosa, and in 68 to the submucosa. Twenty-three patients in the former group had no lymph node involvement, whereas 24 patients (35.3%) of the latter group had lymph node metastases. The 5-year survival rate after surgery for patients with SEC limited to the mucosa was 83.5%, which was significantly better than that for carcinoma invading the submucosa (54.9%). No recurrent disease occurred in patients with lesions limited to the mucosa. In conclusion, an esophagectomy with wide lymphadenectomy is necessary to provide a better prognosis for SEC invading the submucosa, whereas a less extensive treatment may be considered for SEC limited to the mucosa.

"Family cancer syndrome: a study of the kindred of a man with osteogenic sarcoma of the mandible. Several familial cancer syndromes have been identified. The syndrome of sarcomas, breast cancer and other neoplasms, known as Li-Fraumeni syndrome, is characterized by several different neoplasms presenting at young ages with autosomal dominant transmission and a high incidence of second primaries. In this paper, we studied six generations (51 people) of the family of a 24-year-old man with osteogenic sarcoma of the mandible. Twelve malignancies in 11 people, including several rare tumors, were revealed. Mean age of presentation was 24 years old. Nine of the 11 patients died of disease. One developed a second primary. Two tumors presented in the head and neck. Transmission was autosomal dominant. The karyotypes of two family members were normal. Identification of Li-Fraumeni syndrome in a family is important in determining appropriate follow-up for the patient and family. Such families are models for studying carcinogenesis. ",0
"Reduced platelet aggregability and thromboxane release after rebleeding in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Serial blood samples were obtained from 80 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) to study adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation and associated thromboxane B2 release. The goal of the investigation was to detect whether reduced platelet function is involved in rebleeds. Seventeen patients (21%) suffered a rebleed, six of those experiencing their first rebleed within 24 hours after SAH. Therefore, most platelet function studies were performed after rebleeds. Thromboxane release was lower in patients with rebleeds than in the others, both before and after rebleeding, although statistical significance was reached only in samples collected after rebleeds. Patients rebleeding within 24 hours after SAH had lower platelet aggregability (p = 0.037) than patients without a rebleed in the samples taken within 3 days after SAH. The results suggest that reduced platelet aggregability and thromboxane release are involved in rebleeds following primary SAH. ",0
"Retrospective application of prognostic indices to pancreatitis discovered at necropsy. Six prognostic indices, which were developed to assess inpatients with acute pancreatitis, were evaluated for possible retrospective application. When applied to a series of 14 cases in whom pancreatitis was first diagnosed at necropsy, the index devised by Jacobs et al was found to be the most useful, because in nine of these cases eight or more of the variables required were available for assessment from the case records. In the other indices evaluated fewer than eight of the required variables were available for retrospective assessment in most cases. Although undiagnosed pancreatitis is probably uncommon as a sole cause of death, the retrospective use of one or more of these indices may help assess the severity of the patient's condition on admission to hospital.

"Anterior segment ischemia: a complication of retinal detachment repair in a patient with sickle cell trait. Anterior segment ischemia (ASI) is a dreaded complication of retinal detachment surgery particularly in patients with predisposing factors such as sickle cell disease. We report a case of ASI after scleral buckling in an otherwise healthy black patient with sickle cell trait. Conditions of relative hypoxia intraoperatively from either anesthesia or surgical manipulation may precipitate vasoocclusive phenomena in these normally asymptomatic patients. Since the incidence of sickle cell trait in the black population in the United States is 8.5%, we recommend these patients have a preoperative sickle test followed by hemoglobin electrophoresis with quantification if positive. The presence of sickle cell trait should alert the surgeon to the risk of ASI, and factors predisposing to hypoxia should be minimized when possible. ",0
"Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis due to Salmonella enteritidis in cirrhotic ascites. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis due to Salmonella is uncommon. We report three patients with ascites infected by Salmonella. All three patients had advanced chronic liver disease, typically cirrhosis with portal hypertension. Salmonella enteritidis grew in the ascite fluid culture of the three patients. There was no clinical or microbiological evidence of Salmonella infection other than in the ascitic fluid. One patient died before antibiotic treatment was started, but the other two were treated with different combinations of antimicrobial drugs. One of them died on the fourteenth day of hospitalization, and the other survived. ",0
"The Gore-Tex anterior cruciate ligament prosthesis. Two versus three year results. A prospective clinical study of the results of prosthetic ligament replacement of the ACL with the Gore-Tex polytetrafluoroethylene prosthesis was undertaken. Thirty-three (80%) of 41 patients were available at a minimum 36 month followup (mean, 48 months; range, 36 to 62). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed an 82% probability of survival of the polytetrafluoroethylene ligament at the 48 month followup. When compared to the same data at a minimum 24 month followup, the results appeared to have deteriorated somewhat over time. Three possible ""predictors"" of failure at later followup were identified: preoperative subjective symptoms of swelling, subjective symptoms of giving way at 2 years, and an increased anterior drawer sign at 2 years.

"Spinal cord compression from a thoracic paraganglioma: case report. A 34-year-old man with a 4-month history of midthoracic back pain sought treatment for a recent onset of lower extremity paresthesia and stiffness. A myelogram and computed tomographic myelogram disclosed an extradural block at the level of the 8th thoracic vertebral body with involvement of the pedicles, lamina, and spinous process. A posterior decompression of the spinal cord with subtotal resection of a highly vascular tumor was performed. The tumor was identified as a paraganglioma. In a second stage, the remainder of the tumor was embolized preoperatively, and gross total excision and sequential stabilization of the spine with a Luque rectangle and sublaminar wires were performed. The patient has been symptom free and without signs of a recurrence in the spine for over 13 months. A large abdominal paraganglioma was recently resected from its probable origin from the adventitia of the abdominal aorta. ",0
"Collagen phenotypes during development and regression of myocardial hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The myocardium contains collagen matrix that is a major determinant of its architecture, structural integrity, and mechanical properties. This fibrillar matrix consists primarily of type I and type III collagens having epimysial, perimysial, and endomysial components. The present study shows the alteration of collagen phenotypes during the evolution of hypertensive hypertrophy. Therapy with captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor that regresses cardiac hypertrophy, not only reduces the total amount of collagen but reverses the altered distribution of type I and type III collagen. In normotensive rats, captopril did not significantly reduce collagen content or alter the ratio of type I to type III collagen. ",0
"Antibodies in anti-HBe-positive patient sera bind to an HBe protein expressed on the cell surface of human hepatoma cells: implications for virus clearance. The relevance of the recently described membrane-bound form of the HBe protein for the antiviral immune response was examined. The data show that antibodies in anti-HBe, but not in anti-HBc-positive human sera efficiently bind to the membrane expressed HBe. No evidence was obtained that the HBc can reach the cell surface in a form that can be detected with human antibodies. The findings suggest that the decline of virus titer that is usually observed after seroconversion from HBe to anti-HBe might be the result of an antibody-mediated elimination of infected cells. ",0
"Human ehrlichiosis: a rickettsial disease associated with severe cholestasis and multisystemic disease. We report an unusual case of a typically canine rickettsial disease, ehrlichiosis, in a 56-year-old man. Although only occasionally affecting humans with a mild illness, exposure to a tick bite in our patient led to severe multisystemic disease with intense cholestasis. Coma, acute renal failure and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation ensued. Imaging procedures showed no biliary obstruction. A liver biopsy demonstrated bile stasis and sinusoidal lymphoid infiltrates. The diagnosis was confirmed serologically. Only partial improvement occurred with tetracycline therapy, but total resolution of all abnormalities eventually followed therapy with chloramphenicol. ",0
"Treatment of moderate-to-severe hypothermia in an urban setting. STUDY OBJECTIVES: To study the treatment of moderate-to-severe hypothermia using a combination of core rewarming techniques. DESIGN: A prospective study. SETTING: The emergency department of an urban, community hospital. TYPE OF PATIENTS: Sixteen patients who presented with accidental hypothermia with a core temperature of less than 32 C. INTERVENTIONS: All patients were treated with warmed IV fluids either through central or peripheral IV lines and heated aerosol masks. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The patients had a mean rewarming rate of 1.16 C/hr; all survived. The majority were chronic alcoholic patients who presented with multiple medical conditions that required hospitalization. CONCLUSION: All patients recovered with this method of core rewarming. ",0
"Verbal memory impairment correlates with hippocampal pyramidal cell density. Thirty-five patients with medically refractory epilepsy localized to the temporal lobe (18 left, 17 right) completed the verbal Selective Reminding Test before surgery. Verbal memory impairments existed before surgery regardless of the lateralization of the seizure focus, but patients with left temporal seizure foci were significantly more impaired. After surgical removal of the mesial temporal lobe structures, 2 blinded observers established volumetric cell densities for hippocampal subfields CA1, CA2, CA3, the hilar area, and the granule cell layer of the area dentata. Statistically significant correlations existed between presurgical memory impairment and cell counts (in CA3 and the hilar area, only) for patients with left temporal seizure foci. These findings support the hippocampal model of memory and complement prior research documenting the memory impairments present after surgical removal of the mesial temporal structures. ",0
"The encased ureter: bullet and bodkin pattern, a reliable radiographic sign. Among the causes of constricted ureter is benign or malignant encasement. The diagnosis of ureteric encasement is frequently overlooked, even by well informed clinicians and radiologists. The most common benign cause is retroperitoneal fibrosis and the most frequent malignant causes are extension from an adjacent primary tumour, true metastases to the ureter and lymphoma. Lack of recognition of the process may lead to mistaken diagnosis of an inflammatory stricture or infiltrating transitional cell tumour, with resultant inappropriate management. A sign which appears to be almost specific for encasement, the bullet and bodkin configuration, is described here. Newer imaging modalities such as computed tomography and ultrasound, while helpful, are probably less sensitive and less specific than the retrograde ureterogram because a detectable mass is not always present.

"Unusually late onset of cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea after head trauma. Two cases of acute meningitis and cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea, in which the head trauma responsible occurred 10 and 30 years before, are presented. Intraoperatively, the brain parenchyma was found to be plugged into the fractured anterior fossa. By debridement and duraplasty from an intradural approach, both patients were cured. Several precipitating factors could be responsible for this unusually late reopening of the fistula. The possible accidental causes could be coughing or undetected microtraumas, but in the long run, atrophy of tissues and consequent changes in brain compliance with aging may play a role. ",0
"Technetium-99m-methylene diphosphonate (MDP) uptake in a sympathetic effusion: an index of malignancy and a review of the literature. We report a patient with a sympathetic pleural effusion secondary to T-cell lymphoma that accumulated the bone imaging agent, Technetium-99m-methylene diphosphonate (99mTc-MDP). This case is significant in that malignant cells were not present on three cytologic examinations of the pleural fluid or multiple pleural biopsies. We also present a review of the published literature on pleural effusions that accumulate bone tracers. We conclude that pleural effusions that accumulate 99mTc-MDP should be considered malignant or secondary to a malignancy and further work-up is essential even if the cytologic exam of the pleural fluid is unremarkable.

"Lymphoproliferative disorders associated with carbamazepine. Carbamazepine-induced lymphoproliferative disorders are relatively rare. A 32-year-old woman developed cervical lymphadenopathy while taking carbamazepine. Histologic evaluation of the lymph node biopsy specimen demonstrated near-total effacement of the nodal architecture by a population of pleomorphic immunoblasts. The predominant cell population expressed CD3, CD2, CD5, and CD4, while results of testing for CD8 were negative. On the basis of the morphologic and immunohistologic features, a diagnosis of high-grade, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, T-cell immunoblastic type, was made. Despite the fact that aggressive behavior is usually associated with immunoblastic lymphomas, the patient has done well for 33 months after cessation of carbamazepine in the absence of chemotherapeutic treatment. The clinical features of this patient's illness, therefore, suggest that it is best regarded as a so-called pseudolymphoma. ",0
"Decline in the prevalence of childhood deafness in the Jewish population of Jerusalem: ethnic and genetic aspects. A longitudinal study was performed on 147 Jewish children with bilaterally sensorineural hearing loss of moderately severe to profound degree, born in Jerusalem during the eighteen years 1968-85. The prevalence rate of these children declined during the years 1977-85, and at the same time the rate of consanguinity of their parents decreased; this decline was more evident in the genetic group among children with non-Ashkenazi ethnic origin. No such decline was found among the Ashkenazi children and no consanguinity among parents of these children was recorded. Our study supports the assumption that restriction of consanguineous matings may affect the prevalence of genetic deafness in children in a well-defined population. We have tried to remain unbiased and concede certain shortcomings in our present study. ",0
"Presymptomatic and prenatal diagnosis of myotonic muscular dystrophy with linked DNA probes. Advances in neurogenetics are facilitating clinical care. Localization of the mutant gene that causes myotonic muscular dystrophy (DM) to chromosome 19 enabled our predictive testing using linked DNA probes in 74 members of 12 families at risk. Individuals sought either diagnostic confirmation or exclusion with childbearing in mind, or requested prenatal diagnosis. Valuable information was provided for 11 of 12 families. Of 14 individuals at 50% risk, 12 learned they did not have DM, two learned they did (although presymptomatic), and prenatal diagnoses of affected fetuses were made in three families--all with high degrees of certainty. The future opportunity for prenatal diagnosis was provided for 3 other families. The potential health risks to an affected female and her affected or nonaffected fetus provide cogent reasons for physicians to inform DM families in their care about these important advances and opportunities to avert grave complications.

"Repetitive conservative surgery for recurrence of endometriosis. We evaluated the recovery of fertility and the relief of pain symptoms in a long-term follow-up of 42 women undergoing repetitive conservative surgery for recurrent endometriosis. The mean age of the patients was 31.1 +/- 4.3 years. At the time of their second operation the disease was stage IV in 14 women, stage III in 25, and stage I in three. After reoperation, the patients were followed for a mean period of 41.8 +/- 30.3 months. Pain symptoms returned in eight women, dysmenorrhea and deep dyspareunia in eight, and pelvic pain in seven. Eight of the 28 women (28.6%) who attempted to conceive achieved a total of 13 pregnancies. The corrected pregnancy rate was 35%, and the cumulative rate at 27 months was 30.7%. A third operation was necessary in six women after a mean period of 35 months. Conservative surgery is an effective therapeutic option for infertile patients with recurrent endometriosis. ",0
"Adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder. A premalignant lesion? Gallbladder cancer is the most common malignant tumor of the biliary tract, but its early diagnosis is uncommon. The use of ultrasonography has increased the detection of benign gallbladder tumors, and the premalignant potential of gallbladder adenomas is now undisputed. Adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder has recently been suggested to have malignant potential, and we report a case of adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder occurring in localized adenomyomatosis that was successfully treated by radical curative surgery. The more rigorous use of ultrasonography and a more aggressive approach to ""benign"" polypoid lesions of the gallbladder may represent the best way of achieving early diagnosis and cure in gallbladder cancer.

"Chondrosarcomas of the synovium. Chondrosarcoma of the synovium, either primary or secondary to synovial chondromatosis, is rare. Ten cases of synovial chondrosarcoma were studied (four from the Mayo Clinic files and six from the authors' consultation files). Two were considered primary. In five cases there was evidence of preexisting synovial chondromatosis, and in the remaining three, there was a suggestion of preexisting disease. Several histologic features were found that were helpful to diagnose malignancy. The most important ones were loss of the ""clustering"" growth pattern typical of synovial chondromatosis, myxoid change in the matrix, areas of necrosis, and spindling at the periphery of chondroid lobules. Pulmonary metastasis developed in five of nine patients; three of these patients died. ",0
"Prognostic factors in craniofacial surgery. From 1979 to 1989, 21 patients underwent craniofacial resection for malignancies involving the anterior skull base. Histologic types included 8 squamous cell carcinomas, 3 chondrosarcomas, 2 melanomas, 2 basal cell carcinomas, 2 adenocarcinomas, 2 poorly differentiated carcinomas, 1 malignant schwannoma, and 1 malignant hemangiopericytoma. Survival was 57%, with follow-up of 41 months. A 50% complication rate included osteomyelitis, cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea, meningitis, brain abscess, epidural abscess, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone. Recurrent disease occurred in 9 patients (41%), the most reliable predictor being dural invasion indicated preoperatively by CT scan or at operation. Patients demonstrating dural involvement (N = 9) had a 22% survival rate, while patients without (N = 12) had a survival rate of 83%. The impact of dural invasion on long-term survival is emphasized. Though complications were frequent, long-term results were favorable. ",0
"Changes in ventricular fibrillation threshold during the development of perinephritic hypertension. Established hypertension is associated with enhanced susceptibility to life-threatening arrhythmias. However, little is known about the effects of the development of hypertension on the electro-physiological properties of the heart. To study this relationship, dogs were chronically instrumented for recording mean arterial pressure and conducting cardiac electrical testing during right ventricular pacing using an intracavitary bipolar catheter. In normotension, ventricular fibrillation threshold was determined under alpha-chloralose anesthesia, after which perinephritic hypertension was induced by wrapping one kidney in silk followed by contralateral nephrectomy. During serial testing of the same animals, ventricular fibrillation threshold was significantly increased early in the development of hypertension (2 to 3 weeks after renal wrapping), but found to be significantly reduced at 6 to 7 weeks after renal wrapping. The increase in ventricular fibrillation threshold was eliminated by cholinergic blockade. ",0
"Post-transplant hypertension. Post-transplant hypertension remains an important risk factor for cardiovascular mortality and graft function. There are multiple mechanisms responsible for post-transplant hypertension. The details of these mechanisms are poorly understood. Steroids, acute and chronic rejection, recurrent renal disease, native kidney disease, and renal artery stenosis have all been implicated in causing post-transplant hypertension. With the addition of cyclosporine, a known hypertensive agent, to the immunosuppressive armamentarium, the evaluation of post-transplantation hypertension has become difficult. Presently, medical therapy is initially directed toward the complications of cyclosporine nephrotoxicity. Empirically, converting enzyme inhibitors are added to the antihypertensive regimen. Further management is aimed at identification of specific causes of post-transplant hypertension. Unfortunately, because of the multifactorial etiology of post-transplant hypertension and a lack of detailed information about the mechanisms, medical and surgical therapy are often unrewarding. Further study is needed to clarify the mechanisms involved in post-transplant hypertension, and thus direct therapy. ",0
"Recurrent lateral rectus palsy in childhood. Five patients with recurrent, lateral rectus palsy in childhood, examined at the University of Iowa Hospitals over a period of 22 years, are reported. During the same period, 131 abducens nerve palsy patients, younger than 18 years of age, were evaluated. Eighteen similar patients, most single case reports, are reviewed from the literature. All reported patients, including our own, shared the following features: spontaneous recovery within 6 months in the majority of patients, ipsilateral recurrence, and painless palsy. There is female and left-sided preponderance. Etiology is undetermined. Hypotheses include viral etiology, neurovascular compression by aberrant artery, and migraine. ",0
"Gonadoblastoma in an anatomically normal man: a case report and literature review. Gonadoblastoma, a rare gonadal neoplasm, presents most frequently in phenotypic female or phenotypically male patients with dysgenetic gonads or undescended testes. To date, only 2 cases of gonadoblastoma have been reported in anatomically normal male patients with scrotal testes. Both of these patients presented with testicular masses and germ cell tumors. We report a case of a genotypically and phenotypically normal, fertile man with descended testes who on evaluation for chronic orchialgia had a gonadoblastoma unaccompanied by a germ cell neoplasm. The tumor was nonpalpable and was initially discovered on scrotal ultrasound. ",0
"Visual recovery in patients with optic neuritis and visual loss to no light perception. We reviewed the records of 151 patients with optic neuritis examined over an eight-year period. Of these patients, 12 developed visual acuity of no light perception during the first episode of optic neuritis in the affected eye. Eight of the 12 patients recovered visual acuity of 20/40 or better. Of these, five patients had visual acuity of 20/20 or better, one had visual acuity of 20/25, one had visual acuity of 20/30, and one had visual acuity of 20/40. Four of the 12 patients recovered peripheral visual fields but had dense central scotomas and visual acuity of less than 20/400. Dyschromatopsia persisted after visual recovery in 11 of 12 patients.

"Three-dimensional reconstructed MR imaging of the inner ear. The three-dimensional Fourier transform fast imaging with steady precession (FISP) technique was used to obtain high-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) images of the temporal bone region and to generate three-dimensional reconstructed images of the inner ear. The three-dimensional reconstructed images of the inner ear were directly synthesized from two-dimensional images of the temporal bone region by means of an external processing computer. With use of three-dimensional reconstructed images and stereoscopic observations, structures inside the temporal bone region and the positional relationship among them were easily recognized. These structures are difficult to demonstrate with two-dimensional images. This three-dimensional method was also shown to be useful for recognition of disease and anatomic malformations in the temporal bone region. ",0
"Effects of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty on sleep architecture and patterns of obstructed breathing. In this retrospective study, 72 obstructive sleep apnea patients with polysomnograms taken before and after uvulopalatopharyngoplasty were evaluated. Postoperatively, there was a significant improvement of sleep architecture and respiratory indices. In addition, a second group of 17 patients also had position recordings with their polysomnograms. Time spent in supine and lateral sleep positions changed postoperatively. There was significant decrease of the apnea plus hypopnea index in the lateral position. This study indicates that there is significant improvement of sleep architecture and respiratory indices in the majority of patients after uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, particularly in the lateral sleep position.

"Cytologic criteria to distinguish hepatocellular carcinoma from nonneoplastic liver. The authors reviewed a series of fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) specimens of the liver to identify useful cytologic criteria to distinguish hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from nonneoplastic liver. Ten cytologic features were examined in this study: high cellularity, acinar pattern, trabecular pattern, hyperchromasia, pleomorphism, irregularly granular chromatin, uniformly prominent nucleoli, multiple nucleoli, increased nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, and atypical naked hepatocytic nuclei. These features were examined in a series of 82 FNAB specimens from 52 patients with HCC and 30 patients with nonneoplastic lesions. With the use of a step-wise logistic regression analysis, three features were identified as predictive of HCC: increased nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio (P = 0.001), trabecular pattern (P = 0.002), and atypical naked hepatocytic nuclei (P = 0.03). When these three criteria were used, the sensitivity of diagnosing HCC by FNAB was 100%, and the specificity was 87%. ",0
"Reduced platelet aggregability and thromboxane release after rebleeding in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Serial blood samples were obtained from 80 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) to study adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation and associated thromboxane B2 release. The goal of the investigation was to detect whether reduced platelet function is involved in rebleeds. Seventeen patients (21%) suffered a rebleed, six of those experiencing their first rebleed within 24 hours after SAH. Therefore, most platelet function studies were performed after rebleeds. Thromboxane release was lower in patients with rebleeds than in the others, both before and after rebleeding, although statistical significance was reached only in samples collected after rebleeds. Patients rebleeding within 24 hours after SAH had lower platelet aggregability (p = 0.037) than patients without a rebleed in the samples taken within 3 days after SAH. The results suggest that reduced platelet aggregability and thromboxane release are involved in rebleeds following primary SAH. ",0
"Acetazolamide in the treatment of abnormal oculovestibular response. We treated seven patients with incapacitating vertigo elicited by walking down a grocery store aisle or driving a car. Results of neurologic, neuro-ophthalmic, and neuroradiologic examinations were normal. Episodic vertigo secondary to an abnormal oculovestibular response was diagnosed. Each patient was given a trial of 250 to 500 mg of acetazolamide daily. Symptoms resolved completely in four patients, two patients had near resolution of symptoms, and one patient had no relief. Carbonic anhydrase activity has been demonstrated in the inner ear, and acetazolamide has been shown to affect the ion balance of the inner ear fluids. ",0
"Tissue expansion of the head and neck. Indications, technique, and complications. Tissue expansion is indicated in the reconstruction of various defects of the head and neck in instances where there is inadequate adjacent tissue to allow either primary closure of the defect or repair with a local flap. It may also be indicated in instances where repair of a defect by an alternative method such as a local, regional, or distant flap will result in an unacceptable donor or recipient site deformity. Although tissue expansion is simplistic in concept, it does require judgment and indepth preoperative planning to ensure optimal results. The complication rate is high for tissue expansion in the head and neck, particularly in the cheek and neck area. Despite the frequency of complications, in the vast majority of cases the intended reconstruction is successful. ",0
"Ureteral stump carcinoma incidentally found at cystectomy for bladder cancer. We report on a sixty-five-year-old man with hematuria secondary to superficial bladder cancer. Because of previous urethral trauma, a complete transurethral resection of his bladder tumor could not be done. He, therefore, underwent cystectomy, at which time we incidentally found a transitional cell carcinoma of the left ureteral stump that had been left from a previous left nephrectomy for a World War II-related injury. This case underscores the importance of a thorough investigation of the complete urinary tract in a patient with hematuria or other urinary tract symptoms even if an obvious cause is found for his symptoms.

"Interleukin 1 beta is expressed predominantly by enterocytes in experimental colitis. The cytokine interleukin 1 beta is an important mediator of inflammatory processes capable of inducing eicosanoid production, T-cell activation, and increased vascular permeability. In this study, in situ hybridization techniques were used to delineate the kinetics and cellular source of induced interleukin 1 beta in acute experimental colitis. The induction of interleukin 1 beta messenger RNA was an early phenomenon and occurred predominantly in undifferentiated cells located in the basal part of the mucosal crypts but not in differentiated enterocytes. The undifferentiated enterocytes retained the messenger RNA during differentiation and migration to more apical parts of the crypts. These results suggest that induction of interleukin 1 beta messenger RNA in enterocytes is causally related to the subsequent inflammatory changes seen in acute experimental colitis. ",0
"Clustering of atherogenic behaviors in coffee drinkers. We studied the clustering of coffee consumption and selected atherogenic behaviors in older adults living in a southern California community. Men were somewhat more likely to drink caffeinated coffee while women were more likely to drink decaffeinated coffee. In men, but not women, caffeinated coffee drinking decreased with age and decaffeinated coffee drinking increased. Caffeinated coffee drinkers drank more alcohol, consumed more dietary saturated fats and cholesterol, were more likely to be current smokers and less likely to be current exercisers than were non-coffee drinkers. Smoking and exercise also showed a dose-response relationship to the amount of caffeinated coffee consumed. Risk factor levels among drinkers of decaffeinated coffee were more like those of caffeinated coffee than non-drinkers. These data illustrate the clustering of atherogenic behaviors with coffee drinking and highlight their potential importance in interpreting the growing body of literature about coffee and health. ",0
"Relationship between duration of spinal cord ischemia and postoperative neurologic deficits in animals. Stagnara wake-up tests, blood flow measures, somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), and neurogenic-motor evoked potentials (NMEPs) were elicited from 20 hogs before and after spinal cord overdistraction at L3-L4. Overdistraction was maintained from 5 to 30 minutes after loss of NMEPs. Results suggest that the longer the duration of overdistraction the greater the likelihood of paraplegia. Blood flow measures indicated that reduced perfusion was greatest at the distraction site but extended proximally and distally. Finally, NMEPs were more sensitive to onset of overdistraction and a more valid indicator of paraplegia than SEPs. NMEPs should provide the surgeon with more time for initiation of intervention techniques than SEPs. Because NMEPs and SEPs provide information regarding different spinal cord tracts, the authors continue to use both methods for monitoring the functional integrity of the human spinal cord during corrective spine surgery.

"A topographical relationship between Helicobacter pylori and gastritis: quantitative assessment of Helicobacter pylori in the gastric mucosa. A topographical relationship between the number of Helicobacter pylori in the gastric mucosa and the histological severity of gastritis was studied in 902 pairs of biopsy specimens taken from 314 patients. A pair of biopsies were taken from the antrum, the lesser curvature of the middle body, and the greater curvature of the upper body of the stomach. The quantitative assessment of H. pylori was made based on smear, culture, and tissue section. The histological severity of gastritis was assessed as to the degrees of mononuclear cell and polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration. A positive correlation was confirmed between the number of H. pylori and the severity of polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration. The degrees of inflammatory cells infiltration in the specimens with H. pylori colonization were significantly lower in the upper body than in the antrum. ",0
"Magnetic resonance imaging in Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome. Six girls with suspected Rokitansky syndrome underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and then sonography and laparoscopy to confirm the clinical diagnosis and define the precise characteristics of the malformation. The uterus was missing in all; four had mullerian rudiments in place of the uterus, which were cavitary in two as shown by sonography and in one by MRI. Both ovaries were present in all cases, normally located in four and extrapelvic in two; they were correctly identified by MRI in all cases and by sonography in four. Partially canalized vaginal rudiments were recognized by MRI in two girls and by sonography in one. One patient had unilateral renal agenesis, demonstrated by both MRI and sonography. Magnetic resonance imaging was more precise than laparoscopy and sonography in defining the anatomical characteristics of Rokitansky syndrome, and is less invasive and expensive than laparoscopy. ",0
"A multifocal schwannoma of the masseteric nerve causing hemicrania. A case is reported of schwannoma of the right masseteric nerve, invading the pterygopalatine fossa and the parapharyngeal space through the mandibular notch in a 61-year-old woman. The tumor in this case was composed of four various-sized interconnected nodules, simulating a string of beads. The tumor was the cause of the patient's chronic hemicrania, as confirmed by the relief from and disappearance of head pain after surgical removal of the tumor. The most important aspects of this case are the anatomic site of the schwannoma and its uncommon clinicopathologic manifestations; this tumor originated from the masseteric nerve and is the first case reported to straddle the mandibular notch.

"Long-term outcome of massive small bowel resection. The long-term outcome for seven patients 4-17 yr (mean 7.1 yr) after massive small bowel resection, leaving 5-160 cm (mean 86.4) of small bowel, was reviewed. Their mean age at the final enterectomy was 40 yr. Adaptation to foodstuffs and the effects of physiologic alterations and complicating diseases on their return to work were emphasized. More than 3.5 yr after surgery, the patients had adapted to many kinds of foodstuffs, but dietary fat could not be tolerated by three patients. Six patients returned to work an average of 2.7 yr after surgery, but four were obliged to discontinue their work because of rehospitalization for long-term complications. In addition, their working hours were limited, and they could not engage in heavy physical work, owing to physiologic alterations, such as a reduced metabolic state, after massive enterectomy. ",0
"Magnetic resonance imaging of facial nerve neuromas. Facial nerve neuromas are uncommon tumors often confused with other tumors of the temporal bone and cerebellopontine angle. Radiologically, it may be impossible to differentiate an intracanalicular facial nerve neuroma from an acoustic neuroma. We present three case reports of facial nerve neuromas arising within the internal auditory canal to show the important magnetic resonance imaging features of these tumors. One tumor extended into the cerebellopontine angle, middle cranial fossa, and middle ear. Another filled the internal auditory canal and extended through the cerebellopontine angle to the brain stem. The third occurred in a patient who had neurofibromatosis as well as numerous other intracranial tumors. We feel that gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging provides the most useful information in the preoperative assessment of this disorder. ",0
"Primary adrenal insufficiency: a new cause of reversible gastric stasis. Primary adrenal insufficiency is known to cause a wide spectrum of sometimes severe upper gastrointestinal symptoms; however, it has not previously been shown to be the cause of reversible gastric stasis. We have documented such a case in which the symptoms and physiologic abnormalities associated with gastric stasis were reversed by steroid replacement. A follow-up radionuclide gastric-emptying study after physiologic steroid replacement showed complete normalization of gastric emptying. Although gastric stasis has long been suspected of being present with primary adrenal insufficiency, this represents the first case in which it has been documented, and so should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with chronic nausea and vomiting.

"Reproducibility of image interpretation in immunoscintigraphy performed with indium-111- and iodine-131-labeled OC125 F(ab')2 antibody injected into the same patients. An important criterion for the clinical use of a new imaging technique is the correct reproducibility of interpretation. Forty-six paired immunoscintigraphic examinations were performed on 43 patients with suspected ovarian carcinoma recurrence using F(ab')2 fragments of OC125 antibody labeled first with indium-111 and then with iodine-131. Planar scintigraphy (PS) and emission computed tomography (ECT) images were interpreted blindly and separately by three observers, and reproducibility was evaluated by a kappa concordance index. Intra- and interobserver reproducibility were generally satisfactory (kappa values of 0.6 and 0.7, respectively). Binomial analysis of kappa values for ECT showed the superiority of indium-111 for intraobserver (p = 0.035) and interobserver (p = 0.0039) study. However, for PS there was no significant difference in reproducibility with the two radionuclides. ",0
"Respiratory muscle involvement in nemaline myopathy. A boy who had experienced generalized muscle weakness and hypotonia since early infancy was diagnosed as having nemaline myopathy on the basis of muscle biopsy at 3 years of age. At 8 years of age, he developed severe respiratory failure and required respiratory support during sleep. Because of recurrent pneumothorax, he underwent thoracic surgery, at which time biopsy specimens were obtained from the respiratory and truncal muscles. The histologic findings of the respiratory muscles included marked variation in fiber size with a notable increase in fibrous tissue, type 2 fiber deficiency, elevated acid phosphatase activity, and a disorganized intermyofibrillar network. The findings from the truncal muscles were similar to those of the biceps brachii muscle: little variation in fiber size, numerous nemaline bodies in all fibers, and type 1 fiber predominance. The preferential damage to the respiratory muscles was probably responsible for the sudden onset of severe respiratory failure. ",0
"Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening: further consideration of low-volume testing. Unrecognized assay drift that may occur during low-volume (fewer than 500 specimens per week) maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein testing could result in either underestimation or overestimation of the number of pregnant women who are at increased risk of fetal malformations and genetic anomalies. Quality control software programs that incorporate the use of a multirule Shewhart chart are designed to detect assay drift. Careful selection of quality control sera for inclusion in analytic assays and appropriate application of a multirule quality control procedure to values that are obtained on these control materials should detect assay drift, regardless of the volume of patients' specimens in the run.

"5-Aminosalicylic acid is a potent inhibitor of interleukin 1 beta production in organ culture of colonic biopsy specimens from patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Interleukin 1 beta in biopsy specimens from inflamed colonic mucosa of patients with active inflammatory bowel disease was studied. Compared with normal colonic mucosal biopsy specimens, a significantly greater amount of interleukin 1 beta was present in rectal mucosa before (median (range) 4.3 (2.0-11.8) v 119.2 (30.1-286.8) pg/mg; p less than 0.01) and produced during organ culture (39.1 (9.4-106.8) v 97.6 (28.2-991.6) pg/mg; p less than 0.01). Values of interleukin 1 beta after culture correlated with concentrations of thromboxane B2. Organ culture of inflamed biopsy specimens in the presence of 5 aminosalicylic acid and dexamethasone reduced the amount of interleukin 1 beta detected. At the doses studied, 5 aminosalicylic acid also reduced the amount of leukotriene B4 detected after culture. ",0
"Rapid intravenous rehydration in the pediatric emergency department Children suffering from mild to moderate (3 to 6%) dehydration likely caused by viral gastroenteritis are often hospitalized because they are unable to tolerate oral fluids. We studied 17 such children, aged one to six years, who were otherwise healthy. All had isonatremic dehydration and were treated with 30 ml/kg of 3.3% dextrose and 0.3% saline over a period of three hours in the emergency department before being discharged. No patient required admission to the hospital. Only one patient required another course of rapid intravenous rehydration and subsequently improved without hospitalization. Although all our patients experienced vomiting before treatment, 65% had no vomiting after treatment. Rapid intravenous rehydration is an effective treatment, for children with mild to moderate dehydration secondary to presumed viral gastroenteritis, that obviates the need for hospitalization. ",0
"The surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation. III. Development of a definitive surgical procedure. On the basis of the known electrophysiologic mechanisms of atrial fibrillation, multiple surgical procedures were designed and tested in dogs to determine the feasibility of developing a surgical cure for human atrial fibrillation. These experimental studies culminated in a surgical approach that effectively creates an electrical maze in the atrium. The atrial incisions prevent atrial reentry and allow sinus impulses to activate the entire atrial myocardium, thereby preserving atrial transport function postoperatively. Since September 1987, this surgical procedure has been applied in seven patients, five with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation of 2 to 9 years' duration and two with chronic atrial fibrillation of 3 and 10 years' duration. All seven patients have been cured of atrial fibrillation and none is receiving any postoperative antiarrhythmic medications. ",0
"mtDNA depletion with variable tissue expression: a novel genetic abnormality in mitochondrial diseases. We studied two related infants with a fatal mitochondrial disease, affecting muscle in one and liver in the other. Quantitative analysis revealed a severe depletion of mtDNA in affected tissues. This genetic abnormality was also observed in muscle of an unrelated infant with myopathy and in muscle and kidney of a fourth child with myopathy and nephropathy. Biochemistry, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization showed that the depletion of mtDNA in muscle fibers was correlated with a respiratory chain defect and with lack of mitochondrially translated proteins. Although the differential tissue involvement in these infants suggests mtDNA heteroplasmy, sequence analysis of mtDNA replication origins did not reveal any abnormality that could account for the low copy number.

Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy in combination with transurethral surgery for management of large bladder calculi and moderate outlet obstruction. In 5 men evaluated for symptoms of obstructive voiding flexible cystoscopy revealed large or multiple bladder calculi along with small to moderate prostatic enlargement. All patients had successful localization and fragmentation of calculi with the Dornier HM3 lithotriptor. Of these patients 4 underwent transurethral resection or incision of the prostate under the same epidural anesthesia for moderate prostatic obstruction without complication and 1 subsequently required suprapubic prostatectomy of a gland with a large middle lobe that made a transurethral operation difficult. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy should be considered for the primary management of large or hard bladder calculi and it is of particular value in combination with a transurethral operation for patients with small to moderate prostatic obstruction. ,0
"Audit of results of operations for infantile pyloric stenosis in a district general hospital Because of the proposal that infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis should only be treated by surgeons with an interest in paediatric surgery, we carried out a retrospective study to audit our experience in a district general hospital. Forty six infants over a five year period underwent pyloromyotomy. There were no deaths, and 36 infants (78%) made uneventful recoveries. Perforation of the duodenal mucosa occurred during the operation in 11 patients, and eight complications developed in six of these infants. There were seven wound infections, and two patients had vomiting that lasted four days or longer after their operations. There were no long term feeding problems. The results of this study show that such patients can be successfully treated in district general hospitals, and three areas merit special attention: meticulous surgical technique, the use of prophylactic antibiotics, and early graduated feeding.

"A consensus approach to electrolytes and blood pressure. Could we all be right? This commentary sets forth the hypothesis that the putative beneficial or detrimental effects of specific electrolytes on blood pressure regulation in fact reflect highly integrated responses to interactions among these cationic and anionic species. In this paradigm, the impact of any given intake of an electrolyte on arterial pressure will be influenced by the concurrent consumption of other electrolytes. Thus, the heterogeneous blood pressure response in humans to isolated manipulations of nutrients such as sodium, calcium, and potassium may be determined, in part, by the adequacy of the dietary intake of other mineral elements. If this hypothesis is validated by continued research in this area, we would have new strategies available to improve blood pressure control in humans. For example, treatment of ""NaCl sensitivity"" in some humans might be more effectively approached by correcting dietary deficiencies of either potassium or calcium than by restricting dietary NaCl.

"Hot spots for growth hormone gene deletions in homologous regions outside of Alu repeats. Familial growth hormone deficiency type 1A is an autosomal recessive disease caused by deletion of both growth hormone-1 (GH1) alleles. Ten patients from heterogeneous geographic origins showed differences in restriction fragment length polymorphism haplotypes in nondeleted regions that flanked GH1, suggesting that these deletions arose from independent unequal recombination events. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples from nine of ten patients showed that crossovers occurred within 99% homologous, 594-base pair (bp) segments that flanked GH1. A DNA sample from one patient indicated that the crossover occurred within 454-bp segments that flanked GH1 and contained 274-bp repeats that are 98% homologous. Although Alu repeats, which are frequent sites of recombination, are adjacent to GH1, they were not involved in any of the recombination events studied. These results suggest that length and degree of DNA sequence homology are important in defining recombination sites that resulted in GH1 deletions. ",0
"Extracranial metastatic glioblastoma: appearance on thallium-201-chloride/technetium-99m-HMPAO SPECT images. Sequential thallium-201-chloride and technetium-99m-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images were obtained in a patient with extracranial metastatic glioblastoma multiforme. Thallium-201 uptake was high (three times the scalp background) in all pathologically confirmed extracranial metastases and moderate (1.6 times scalp background) intracranially, where most biopsy specimens showed gliosis with scattered atypical astrocytes. Technetium-99m-HMPAO uptake was decreased intracranially in the right frontal and parietal lobes which had been irradiated. It was also decreased in one well-encapsulated scalp lesion and high in another scalp mass with less defined borders. Possible mechanisms of tumor uptake of these agents are reviewed. ",0
"Conjunctival involvement in pemphigus vulgaris: a clinical, histopathological and immunofluorescence study. Eleven patients with pemphigus vulgaris and with eye complaints had histopathological and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) studies on biopsies of their conjunctivae. In eight of the patients the ocular symptoms preceded the other manifestations of pemphigus. None of the 11 patients had any detectable conjunctival blisters or erosions. The conjunctivitis in three of the patients proved on histopathology and DIF to be a manifestation of pemphigus vulgaris. In the remaining patients, conjunctival hyperaemia with or without a mucoid discharge was observed, but there were no specific histopathological features, although one of them had a positive DIF. ",0
"A cytotoxic T-lymphocyte clone derived from mice with progressively growing tumors. Tumor-specific T-cell clones were derived from spleen cells of mice bearing a syngeneic PHS-5 tumor (a P815 mastocytoma mutant). Cells were expanded in vitro and characterized and assayed for activity against the relevant tumor in vivo. Clone cells were CD4-, CD8+ T lymphocytes, as determined by fluorescence activated cell sorting analysis and were specifically cytotoxic against P815 tumor cells in vitro, as shown in chromium 51 release assays. These cells require both antigen and interleukin 2 to proliferate; neither alone is sufficient, even with the addition of interleukin 1. In an experimental P815 liver metastasis model, the adoptive transfer of GD11 or GD11.17 clone cells and injection of recombinant interleukin 2 (7500 U intraperitoneally) 3 days after infusion of tumor cells reduced the number of tumor nodules, while the adoptive transfer of lymphokine-activated killer cells was ineffective.

"Endoscopic ultrasonography in diagnosis of the extent of gallbladder carcinoma. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) was performed preoperatively in 39 patients with gallbladder carcinoma. Diagnosis of the anatomical extent of gallbladder carcinoma was compared with histologic analysis, and staging accuracy was evaluated according to the TNM classification. Carcinoma considered to be at an early stage with no lymph node metastasis was correctly diagnosed in 87.5%. Differential diagnosis between early and advanced staged tumors was possible in 79.5%. Overall accuracy for depth of tumor invasion (T) was 76.9%. Limitations were due to many stones in the gallbladder and microinfiltration of carcinoma. Assessment of regional lymph node metastasis (N) was at a sensitivity of 81.8% and specificity of 92.9%, for an overall accuracy of 89.7%. We believe endoscopic ultrasonography is useful in the clinical staging of gallbladder carcinoma. ",0
"A self-administered hand symptom diagram for the diagnosis and epidemiologic study of carpal tunnel syndrome. Noninvasive tests for carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) are of limited diagnostic value. A self-administered hand symptom diagram has been developed for use in the diagnosis and epidemiologic study of CTS. Diagrams are rated classic CTS, probable, possible or unlikely. Diagram ratings were compared with nerve conduction diagnoses in 110 patients with upper extremity complaints. A hand diagram rating of classic or probable CTS had sensitivity of 0.64, specificity of 0.73 and positive predictive value of 0.58. The negative predictive value of an unlikely diagram was 0.91. We conclude that the diagram is a useful diagnostic tool and may be valuable for occupational and population screening. ",0
"Leukoaraiosis, intracerebral hemorrhage, and arterial hypertension. To investigate whether the observed association of leukoaraiosis with intracerebral hemorrhage is direct or mediated by risk factors, we compared 116 patients with intracerebral hemorrhage confirmed by computed tomography and 155 controls without intracerebral hemorrhage, evaluating the prevalence of leukoaraiosis and vascular risk factors. Leukoaraiosis was observed in 21 (18%) of the 116 patients and in 12 (8%) of the 155 controls (p less than 0.01). Only two (6%) of the 31 patients with lobar hemorrhage had leukoaraiosis on computed tomograms, compared with 17 (24%) of the 71 patients with basal ganglionic hemorrhage (p less than 0.05). Leukoaraiosis was significantly correlated with intracerebral hemorrhage after controlling for age and sex by using multiple logistic regression analysis, while the correlation disappeared after controlling for hypertension. Our results indicate that leukoaraiosis is not an independent risk factor for intracerebral hemorrhage. ",0
"Recent advance in treatment of Stanford type A aortic dissection. During the period between November 1986 and November 1988, 13 consecutive patients with Stanford type A aortic dissection (8 acute and 5 chronic) were treated as follows: (1) urgent operation for cases with pericardial tamponade or severe heart failure, (2) initial medical treatment followed by elective operation for acute but stable cases or chronic cases, and (3) routine use of open distal anastomosis or selective cerebral perfusion. One patient died during medical treatment: 5 patients were operated on emergently. The remaining 2 acute and 5 chronic cases were operated on electively. There were no operative deaths, neurological disturbances, or late deaths. It is suggested that acute dissection of the ascending aorta requires immediate surgical intervention, especially when the entry is in the ascending aorta. On the other hand, it is also suggested that one could avoid emergency operations in selected cases with retrograde extension of the aortic dissection. ",0
"Muscle rehabilitation in impaired elderly nursing home residents. Based on observations of changes in muscle function associated with aging, and the exacerbation of these changes with frailty, a program of muscle strengthening has been developed to correct specific defects in muscles. This pilot study was undertaken on 18 functionally impaired nursing home residents (age range 60 to 90 years) with markedly deteriorated muscle function (50%) secondary to age, disuse, and multiple chronic illnesses. Fourteen of the subjects completed the six-week program without adverse effects. In 75% of the patients, there was improved muscle function, with endurance, strength, and speed increasing 35%, 15%, and 10%, respectively. After the program, many subjects increased their spontaneous activity and decreased their dependency. The improvements were still evident four months after rehabilitation. These results suggest that it may be possible, through a carefully supervised, short-term program of muscle rehabilitation, for nursing home residents to achieve an enhanced level of physical functioning.

"Chronic alcoholic gastritis. Roles of alcohol and Helicobacter pylori. We assessed the relative roles of alcohol and infection with Helicobacter pylori in the pathogenesis of chronic gastritis in alcoholic patients. Helicobacter pylori was found in 14 of 18 alcoholics with dyspepsia and was associated with chronic antral gastritis. Gastric biopsy specimens were normal in four H pylori-negative alcoholics. Studies were repeated 3 to 4 weeks after controlled abstinence. There was no change in histologic findings during this period, indicating that alcohol itself was not the major causative agent. We then eliminated H pylori in 10 subjects by giving triple therapy (bismuth subsalicylate, amoxicillin, and metronidazole). Treatment for H pylori was associated with almost complete normalization of histologic findings. Four control subjects who received antacids alone showed no improvement. Dyspeptic symptoms in H pylori-positive patients significantly improved after elimination of this organism, whereas there was no change with antacid treatment. ",0
"Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia associated with profound lymphopenia and abnormal T-lymphocyte subset ratios during treatment for early-stage breast carcinoma. Two women with Stage II breast carcinoma treated with lumpectomy followed by breast irradiation and adjuvant chemotherapy developed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia while receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy. Neither woman had evidence of immunosuppression before therapy. They both had profound lymphopenia, reversed CD4/CD8 ratios, and normal peripheral blood total leukocyte counts at the time of their infections. Both women were seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and had no risk factors for such an infection. The patients' CD4 lymphocyte counts increased after chemotherapy for breast carcinoma was discontinued. Thus, it appears that the therapy they received may have caused severe T-lymphocyte mediated immunosuppression. ",0
"Computed tomography in patients with esophageal perforation. Contrast esophagram is the diagnostic procedure of choice in patients with clinically suspected perforation of the esophagus. In patients in whom the usual clinical signs or symptoms are unrecognized and in whom the diagnosis is obscure, the diagnosis of a perforated esophagus may be suggested by the finding of mediastinal fluid and air on CT. Three patients are reviewed. The perforations included one spontaneous, one from erosion of an esophageal carcinoma, and one iatrogenic. In two of the three patients, the diagnosis of perforated esophagus had not been made initially and in one patient the initial esophagram was interpreted as normal. Computed tomography of the chest in each patient led to the suspected diagnosis of perforated esophagus. Prompt appropriate surgical intervention followed. The findings of mediastinal fluid and more importantly mediastinal air on CT of the chest are strongly suggestive of esophageal perforation. ",0
"Biliary and pancreatic metastases of breast carcinoma: is surgical palliation indicated? Obstructive jaundice developed in a patient concomitantly with the diagnosis of breast carcinoma. Abdominal exploration disclosed a metastatic tumor in the head of the pancreas, the distal bile duct, and the gallbladder. A cholecystectomy and choledochojejunostomy were performed and later, because of intestinal obstruction, the patient underwent gastrojejunostomy. Pathological examination demonstrated metastatic lobular carcinoma of breast with strongly positive staining for estradiol. Additional hormonal therapy has been given to the patient since the operation. The patient is alive 16 months after the diagnosis of her disease. This case suggests that a vigorous diagnostic approach should be adopted in every jaundiced patient with metastatic breast cancer in order to exclude causes of jaundice other than diffuse metastatic involvement of the liver. Patients with extrahepatic biliary metastasis should be treated by aggressive surgical treatment, combined with systemic therapy which can offer them significant palliation and better survival. ",0
"Clinical diagnosis of tamponade in Malawi. A consecutive series of 25 Malawian patients with tamponade secondary to tuberculosis were compared to 25 patients with congestive cardiac failure, without pericardial effusion in a retrospective study. More patients with tamponade had an impalpable apex beat (21/1), pulsus paradoxus (13/0), soft heart sounds (13/2), paradoxical rise in jugular venous pressure (6/0), and fewer had a murmur (1/14). All these results are significant (p less than 0.05) by the chi 2 test with Yates' correction. The presence of two or more of these discriminating physical signs has a positive predictive value of 75 per cent, and a negative predictive value of 99.5 per cent for the diagnosis of tamponade. Clinical diagnosis of tamponade by primary health care personnel in Malawi should be possible, and lead to earlier treatment. ",0
"NMDA antagonists potentiate antiparkinsonian actions of L-dopa in monoamine-depleted rats. Systemically administered N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists, MK-801 ((+)5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo(a,d)cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate) and CPP (3-[(+-)-2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl]-propyl-1-phosphonate), potentiate the ability of L-dopa (L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) to reverse akinesia and to alleviate muscular rigidity in monoamine-depleted rats. On the basis of these findings, it is proposed that NMDA antagonists may be beneficial as adjunctive treatment in the therapy of Parkinson's disease. CPP locally injected into the subthalamic nucleus, entopeduncular nucleus--the rat homologue of the internal pallidal segment--or substantia nigra pars reticulata of monoamine-depleted rats stimulates locomotor activity and alleviates rigidity, whereas local microinjection of CPP into the neostriatum is ineffective. These results make it unlikely that the neostriatum is the site of the antiparkinsonian action of NMDA antagonists in monoamine-depleted rats, whereas the subthalamic nucleus, internal pallidal segment, and substantia nigra pars reticulata appear to be important for the effects of NMDA antagonists.

"Flow cytometric determination of breast tumor heterogeneity. Flow cytometric analysis was done on the DNA content of nuclei obtained from different sites of small breast tumors. Although specimens for analysis were obtained within a few millimeters of each other, dramatic differences were occasionally observed in the DNA histograms. In a limited study involving 141 consecutive breast specimens submitted for flow cytometry, 52% (74) were found to have at least one DNA aneuploid population. In 18% of DNA aneuploid tumors, one or more specimens from areas grossly identified as tumor had no DNA aneuploid population. Because of the proposed correlation of aneuploidy with a poorer prognosis and possible responsiveness to chemotherapy, multiple sites should be assayed when flow cytometric DNA analysis is done. ",0
"Delayed brachial artery occlusion owing to a dog bite of the upper extremity. We report a case of delayed presentation of vascular injury from a superficial dog bite of the upper extremity in a five-year-old male. This example of a significant arterial injury, in the setting of seemingly minor trauma, is the first known report of blunt arterial trauma owing to a dog bite in any age group. Blunt arterial trauma in children is rare unless associated with fractures, dislocations, or massive crush injuries. Additionally, persistent pulses following arterial occlusion are rare and can potentially lead to misdiagnosis of a serious arterial injury. A brief review of pediatric blunt vascular injuries is presented with implications for diagnosis and management of such cases. ",0
"Misinterpretation of the upper parathyroid adenoma on thallium-201/technetium-99m subtraction scintigraphy. Pre-operative thallium-technetium subtraction scintigraphy of 50 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, which was subsequently proven on histology to be due to an adenoma, was compared with operative findings. Six scans were negative and seven uninterpretable. Of the remaining 37 patients, 34 had correct scan prediction of the anatomical locations of the adenomas. On examination of the origins of the adenomas, all six scintigraphic predictions of upper adenomas corresponded to tumours arising from the upper gland found at operation. Of the 25 lower predictions, there was one false positive and 16 were correct, i.e. of lower gland origin, but eight were found to originate from the upper gland. This misinterpretation is though to be due to the prolapse of an adenoma arising from the upper gland towards the lower pole of the thyroid, thereby mimicking a lower lesion on the scan. ",0
"Serological arguments for classifying Raynaud's phenomenon as idiopathic. Twenty-five patients with idiopathic Raynaud's phenomenon were followed prospectively for a mean period of 48 months. Clinical and laboratory assessments were performed on admission and on followup. The sera were analyzed for the presence of autoantibodies (antinuclear, antiskeleton and antiorganelle antibodies). Sixteen patients were antinuclear antibody positive and 2 anticentromere antibody positive. Eight patients produced antivimentin, 5 antimitochondrial, 4 anti-Golgi complex, and 3 anticentriol antibodies. Eleven patients produced antidesmosome antibodies. Only one patient (anti-RNP and antidesmosome antibody positive) developed a systemic disease (mixed connective tissue disease) during followup. The initial screening of sera may help to classify Raynaud's phenomenon as idiopathic more accurately. ",0
"Dissecting aneurysm of the pulmonary artery with pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary artery dissection was observed in a 64-yr-old female patient with severe pulmonary hypertension, which was probably primary (pulmonary vascular resistance, 817 dyn.s.cm-5; normal range less than or equal to 200 dyn.s.cm-5). The patient was admitted to the hospital because of severe dyspnea on exertion. Echocardiography demonstrated a dissecting aneurysm of the pulmonary artery. Right heart catheterization revealed severe pulmonary hypertension (mean pulmonary artery pressure, 64 mm Hg; normal range, 10 to 22 mm Hg); dissection of the pulmonary artery was confirmed by pulmonary arteriography. One-year follow-up was uneventful. In the literature, 28 patients with dissecting aneurysm of the pulmonary artery are reviewed. The dissection has only been diagnosed in life in one patient (by echocardiography). ",0
"Aneurysmal dilatation in saphenous vein bypass grafts. Three patients are reported who developed aneurysmal degeneration of a saphenous vein arterial bypass graft. All three had hypercholesterolemia and two had marked elevation of triglycerides. One bypass was for occlusive disease and two for popliteal aneurysm. There was a long lag, 3 to 7 years between graft implantation and aneurysmal degeneration. The pathology was similar for all three cases with lipid laden macrophages, loss of elastic lamina, and other atherosclerotic changes in the vein wall. While atheromatous changes and aneurysm formation in saphenous vein bypass grafts are rare, this may occur especially in patients with hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia. Careful and prolonged follow-up plus vigorous management of the hyperlipidemic state is mandatory in these patients. ",0
"Carcinoma of the external auditory canal: an update. This review is a continuation of the series of 35 cases of carcinoma of the external auditory canal originally reported by the senior author and colleagues. Eighteen additional cases have been evaluated and treated since 1976. Preoperative high-resolution computed tomographic scanning has replaced polytomography, and improved surgical skull base approaches have allowed for extended resections of advanced lesions. A revised classification for local and extensive lesions is presented. The prognosis for localized tumors treated by en bloc resection remains excellent, whereas prognosis for extensive lesions might be more dependent on histologic type and grade of tumor. ",0
"Monitoring of cortical blood flow during temporary arterial occlusion in aneurysm surgery by the thermal diffusion method. During aneurysm surgery, regional cortical blood flow (CoBF) was continuously monitored in 12 patients with a thermal diffusion flow probe in an attempt to assess the effects of temporary major arterial occlusion on blood flow and outcome. When the CoBF was above 30 ml/100 g/min, the safe period for temporary clipping applied distal to the perforators was 15 minutes. The occlusion time should be shortened when the CoBF is below 30 ml/100 g/min. Two patients suffered basal infarction, which was not detected by CoBF monitoring. Attention should be paid to the blood flow in the deep structures when a temporary clip is applied at a site proximal to the perforating branches. Direct measurement of CoBF may be of value in estimating the time that temporary occlusion of a major vessel can be tolerated. ",0
"Postural hypotension: pressor effect of octreotide not mediated by norepinephrine. Orthostatic hypotension of the Shy-Drager syndrome is a chronic incapacitating condition characterized by lack of an appropriate increase in the plasma norepinephrine level in response to standing. Recently, the somatostatin analogue octreotide has been reported to induce a pressor response in patients having this syndrome. We have reported a case of Shy-Drager syndrome in which octreotide was effective, but the rise in blood pressure was not accompanied by an increase in the plasma norepinephrine level. Hence, the pressor effect of octreotide is not mediated by stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system, but probably through splanchnic vasoconstriction. ",0
"High-risk factors in metastatic gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. The patient with gestational trophoblastic neoplasia faces a number of risks; the greatest is the failure of current treatment to bring about remission. Based on a review of past experience, a number of risk factors associated with failure of single-agent chemotherapy were identified, and the subsequent utilization of combination chemotherapy led to an improved outcome. An analysis of more recent experience has identified factors associated with the failure of standard combination chemotherapy, and it is hoped that the development of new treatments will again improve the outcome. This review provides a perspective on known high-risk factors in light of contemporary treatment. ",0
"DNA sequences 3' of the Ig H chain cluster rearrange in mouse B cell lines. A mouse myeloma cell line MPC11 (IgG2b, kappa) and variants derived from it have been used to study DNA rearrangements that occur at the Ig H chain locus. One variant, F5.5, has acquired both VH gene and C epsilon gene rearrangements. Through genomic Southern blot analysis initially directed to mapping the C epsilon gene rearrangement, we observed that the VH region rearrangement was linked, through an inversion event, to sequences that originate 3' of the CH cluster, i.e., 3' of the C alpha gene. Subsequent studies have shown that DNA rearrangements within the region 3' of the C alpha gene are detected in several other mouse myeloma and hybridoma cell lines and are not associated with the expression of specific isotypes.

"Intra-abdominal palpation of a nasogastric tube in the stomach does not assure appropriate placement. Improperly placed nasogastric (NG) tubes have been associated with considerable morbidity. The only reliable indicator of correct NG tube placement appears to be the aspiration of gastric contents. We have reported a case of major morbidity from an improperly placed NG tube that perforated the cervical esophagus, dissected the mediastinum, and terminated in the omental bursa. No gastric aspirate was obtained by suctioning of the tube, but correct placement was presumed based upon the surgeon's direct intraoperative palpation of the tip of the tube. Failure to aspirate gastric contents should alert the practitioner to the possibility of improper NG tube placement. ",0
"LDH isoenzymes in cerebrospinal fluid in various brain tumours. This study examined the isoenzymatic pattern of LDH in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as well as the ratio between the five fractions of LDH among patients with various brain tumours, carcinomatous meningitis and control groups. LDH 1/LDH 2 less than 1 was found significant for carcinomatous meningitis (p less than 0.001) and brain metastases (p less than 0.001). LDH 1/LDH 2 ratio was found to be significantly lower in carcinomatous meningitis than in brain metastases (p less than 0.05). No LDH 1/LDH 2 ratios smaller than 1 were found in the other groups. The LDH 1/LDH 2 ratio smaller than 1 was found in the early stage of carcinomatous meningitis without other evidences of the involvement of the leptomeninges. Examination of LDH 1/LDH 2 can be found as an adjunctive method to identify brain metastases and carcinomatous meningitis at the initial stage. ",0
"The prognostic value of modal deoxyribonucleic acid in low grade, low stage untreated prostate cancer. We selected for a prospective surveillance study 167 patients with untreated grades 1 and 2 prostate cancer. The tumors were classified regarding modal deoxyribonucleic acid value (ploidy) by flow cytometry, cytological grade by transrectal fine needle aspiration biopsy and local tumor stage. Of the patients 146 could be evaluated. Mean followup was 50 months. The initial ploidy was statistically correlated to cytological grade but not to initial local tumor stage, prostatic acid phosphatase activity or patient age. Initial ploidy and cytological grade had a prognostic value regarding local tumor progression when considered as single predictors and in combination. Two patients with diploid and 8 with nondiploid tumors initially had metastases during the surveillance. Five patients (1 with diploid and 4 with nondiploid disease) died of prostatic cancer. Modal deoxyribonucleic acid value and cytological grade were of prognostic value in untreated prostate cancer. ",0
Diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease in sickle cell anemia by magnetic resonance angiography The study of blood flow by means of magnetic resonance techniques has led to a noninvasive magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) technique for imaging large cerebral vessels. Ten children with sickle cell hemoglobinopathy and a history of acute neurologic syndromes were studied with combined parenchymal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRA. Six had abnormal MRI findings and MRA-defined luminal lesions in the vascular distribution of these parenchymal infarctions. The three children with previous intraarterial angiography had MRA abnormalities that corresponded with vascular lesions on conventional angiograms. Four had normal MRI and MRA findings. We conclude that a combination of MRI and MRA provides a noninvasive screening test for large-vessel disease in this population. ,0
Possible role of leukotrienes in gastritis associated with Campylobacter pylori. This study was done to evaluate the role of leukotrienes (LTs) in gastritis associated with Campylobacter pylori. Biopsy specimens of gastric mucosa were obtained endoscopically from 18 patients with nonulcer dyspepsia for bacteriological and histological examination and extraction of LTs. There was correlation between the LTB4 level in the mucosa and the degree of gastritis evaluated histologically. The level was higher when infiltration of neutrophils in the gastric mucosa was more extensive. The LTB4 level in mucosa infected with C. pylori was higher than that in noninfected mucosa. These findings suggest that endogenous LTs may be related to the pathogenesis of gastritis associated with C. pylori. ,0
"Value of combined assessment of physical health and functional status in community-dwelling aged: a prospective study in Florence, Italy. A survey of the health and social conditions of a representative sample of 967 persons aged 60 years and older from the city of Florence, Italy, was undertaken in 1980. In 1987, a follow-up survey of this cohort was performed. There were 391 documented deaths, 408 survivors, and 168 individuals who could not be located. Functional ability at baseline was assessed using a World Health Organization 14-item scale. Indicators of physical health status included chronic disease status, number of drugs, physician visits, and days of hospitalization. After adjustment for age and sex, both functional ability and indicators of physical health status were found to be independent, statistically significant predictors of mortality. The results of this study further support the view that biomedical and functional assessment are both necessary for a comprehensive evaluation of the older population. ",0
"Neuroleptic malignant syndrome: life-threatening complication of neuroleptic treatment in adolescents with affective disorder. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is an uncommon, potentially fatal side effect of neuroleptic treatment characterized by hyperthermia, rigidity, rhabdomyolysis, and delirium. In recent clinical studies of adults it was suggested that affective disorder is a risk factor for the development of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. The cases of two adolescents with neuroleptic malignant syndrome who were treated with neuroleptic therapy because of psychotic symptoms in association with primary affective disorders are reported. The occurrence of these cases, as well as the observations in adults, suggests that attention to the primary psychiatric diagnosis is important in neuroleptic usage and that physicians should be vigilant to the occurrence of neuroleptic malignant syndrome in the pediatric population.

"Gallstone pancreatitis. Choosing and timing treatment. Patients with gallstone pancreatitis are often seen initially by primary care physicians. Prompt diagnosis and timely intervention are crucial in reducing morbidity and mortality. Initial management should include supportive medical care and surgical consultation. The timing of surgery is then dictated by serum enzyme levels and liver function test results as well as by the patient's condition. The role of endoscopic intervention is currently evolving. Whether surgery or endoscopic sphincterotomy is preferable as primary therapy for gallstone pancreatitis remains unresolved. However, sphincterotomy with stone extraction is a viable option in selected cases, especially in patients who have severe gallstone pancreatitis. ",0
"Anterior perforations in lumbar discectomies. A report of four cases of vascular complications and a CT study of the prevertebral lumbar anatomy. Four cases of vascular complications to anterior perforations during discectomy prompted a CT study to measure lumbar disc diameters and to evaluate the prevertebral anatomy. Fifty young adults who had been referred for low-back pain and/or sciatica but had not undergone operation were included. In five additional patients, prone versus supine CT examinations were compared. Six typical configurations of the vascular anatomy could be classified to explain the type of vascular complications occurring at the L3-4 and L4-L5 disc levels. The sagittal diameter of the three lowest lumbar discs varied from 33 to 56 mm, indicating the importance of this parameter as an intraoperative guideline for the spine surgeon. Air-filled intestines were observed anterior to the L5-S1 disc predominantly in the prone position. The possible relationship between this finding and postoperative discitis is discussed. ",0
"Pleuroperitoneal shunting for intractable pleural effusions. Pleuroperitoneal shunts were implanted in 17 patients with intractable pleural effusions, 15 of which were malignant and 2 benign. Complicating factors included 13 instances of severe trapped lung and 3 cases of synchronous ascites. There was one hospital death. Palliation of dyspnea at rest was achieved in all patients, although 3 required oxygen with exertion. Four shunts became occluded between 1 and 10 months after placement. Two of these were replaced. The remaining conduits continued to function to the present or until the patients' deaths between 1 and 28 months. Shunting allowed hospital discharge and provided symptomatic relief in a group of patients in whom other approaches had failed or were not applicable. ",0
"Beta camera for static and dynamic imaging of charged-particle emitting radionuclides in biologic samples. A detection system based on microchannel plates has been constructed to image charged particles emitted by radionuclides in biomedical samples. This technique has significant advantages over conventional film autoradiography for investigating the distribution of radiolabeled compounds: shorter acquisition times due to the high sensitivity, easier sample handling, direct quantification and the ability to perform dynamic studies. The detector performance shows a spatial resolution of 0.9 mm for carbon-14 (14C) (0.156 MeV), good linearity and homogeneity. The noise level is below 50/(cm2.sec). Successful imaging with this system has been performed with beta-emitters 14C, sulfur-35 (35S), iodine-131 (131I), yttrium-90 (90Y), and positron emitters gallium-68 (68Ga), and fluorine-18 (18F). Dynamic studies of axonal transport of 35S-methionine in a nerve, and static images of 90Y-labeled monoclonal antibodies in slices of tumors are presented. The system shows promise for rapid quantitative imaging of charged-particle emitting radionuclides in small biologic samples. ",0
"Radiotherapy for palliation of locally advanced prostatic carcinoma. Some patients present with distressing symptoms due to locally advanced prostatic carcinoma which may be refractory to hormonal manipulation and/or surgical treatment. Over an 8-year period 26 patients received local palliative radiotherapy for recurrent bleeding and lower urinary outflow tract obstruction. All were treated with conventional external beam radiotherapy and all but 2 obtained useful palliation of symptoms, especially those with recurrent bleeding. We also found that radiotherapy could be given to the majority of patients on an out-patient basis in 2 or 3 fractions. This was well tolerated and there were few side effects. ",0
"Neuropsychological deficits in fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol effects. A clinical sample of 19 school-aged native children diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or fetal alcohol effects (FAE) was compared with age- and sex-matched normal controls. Results on a battery of intellectual and neuropsychological tests indicated large and significant differences between alcohol-affected children and controls. FAS differed significantly from controls on measures of intellectual abilities, while FAE did not; FAS mean scores on these measures were significantly lower than FAE means. For neuropsychological measures, FAS were significantly poorer than controls on most measures, while FAE showed deficits compared with controls only on grip strength. The results suggest that neuropsychological measures would be a valuable supplement to intellectual measures for the purpose of assessing alcohol effects because they are less vulnerable than intellectual measures to the influence of cultural and educational experiences.

"Management of premature removal of the percutaneous gastrostomy. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) has become the preferred method of enteral access for nutritional support. With increased use of this modality, complications are encountered more frequently. Premature withdrawal, inadvertent removal of the gastrostomy tube within the first seven days after insertion, before adherence of the gastric serosa to the parietal peritoneum, has been an indication for laparotomy. This report describes the treatment of premature withdrawal by immediate endoscopic replacement. Over an 18-month period, 271 patients underwent insertion of a PEG. Five patients (1.8%) who inadvertently removed their gastrostomy tube within seven days of insertion were treated with immediate replacement using the retrograde string technique, avoiding laparotomy. All five PEGs were successfully replaced through the same gastrostomy site. Despite the presence of pneumoperitoneum, no patient developed peritonitis or other septic complications. Premature gastrostomy tube withdrawal is safely managed by endoscopic replacement and observation. Laparotomy is unnecessary and potentially meddlesome. ",0
"Elevated intracranial pressure and computed tomography of the brain in fulminant hepatocellular failure. Cerebral herniation is a leading cause of death in patients with fulminant hepatocellular failure. Classical signs of elevated intracranial pressure are often absent in these patients. A reliable noninvasive method by which the presence of cerebral edema could be determined is much needed. To assess the efficacy of computed tomography of the brain in this setting, we compared the radiographic findings to the intracranial pressure measured by an epidural monitor in patients with fulminant hepatic failure. Unfortunately, a considerable difference existed between the presence of cerebral edema diagnosed by computed tomography of the brain and elevation of the intracranial pressure. Our observations suggest that in patients with fulminant hepatic failure and advanced hepatic encephalopathy, computed tomography of the brain is of little value in detecting cerebral edema. Pressure monitoring is most important to establish the presence and guide the therapy of intracranial hypertension. ",0
"Staging of ureteral transitional cell carcinoma by CT and MRI. Intravenous urography and retrograde pyelography are the primary radiologic studies for detecting ureteral carcinoma but give limited information regarding stage of disease. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) delineate the extent of ureteral carcinomas with a high degree of accuracy by depicting the periureteral fat and presence or absence of lymphadenopathy. In selected cases, CT and MRI are valuable for assessing the presence or absence of tumor in a ureteral stump and for the differential diagnosis of ureteral obstruction. Five cases of ureteral carcinoma and 2 cases of stump carcinoma are presented with preoperative CT and/or MRI evaluation and staging. ",0
"Microalbuminuria in essential hypertension. Clinically apparent proteinuria in essential hypertension is associated with increased cardiovascular and total mortality and is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. Subclinical elevation of urinary albumin excretion is seen more frequently than clinical proteinuria in essential hypertension and the levels of microalbuminuria (excretions of 30 to 300 mg/24 h) correlate with blood pressure. The increased urinary albumin excretion in hypertension may be explained by several factors such as renal hemodynamic changes, permselectivity changes of the glomerular filter, and structural arteriolar and glomerular changes due to nephrosclerosis. It has been clearly demonstrated that microalbuminuria is a risk factor for the development of clinical proteinuria, renal failure and increased cardiovascular mortality in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. It is still not known whether microalbuminuria also predicts development of proteinuria and decline in renal function in hypertension but there is some evidence indicating that microalbuminuria may be a marker of increased cardiovascular risk in hypertensives.

"Postoperative lumbar spinal instability occurring or progressing secondary to laminectomy. The manifestations and pathomechanism of postoperative lumbar spinal instability, occurring or progressing secondary to laminectomy, was clarified by means of functional radiographic analysis in a series of 46 patients over 40 years of age. The relation between instability and the clinical symptoms also is discussed. In patients under 60 years of age, instability at the operated level tended to appear in cases of wide laminectomy more often than in cases of partial laminectomy. Occurrence or progress of instability seems to be promoted by resection of the posterior spinal elements rather than the disc. It is further considered that the postoperative aggravation of clinical symptoms may be influenced not only by instability, but also by the other factors. ",0
"Shear stress induces not only platelet aggregation but also platelet-tumor cell interaction. To investigate the interaction between platelets and tumor cells under well-defined flow conditions, the effect of tumor cells on platelet aggregation induced by shear stress was studied using a cone and plate viscometer adapted for measuring transmitted light intensity. Aggregation was markedly enhanced by HMV-1 cells in a cell number-dependent fashion under shear stress of 12 dyne/cm2. Enhancement was not observed at a high shear stress of 108 dyne/cm2. A monoclonal antibody against GPIIb/IIIa, 7E3 completely abolished enhancement of aggregation by HMV-1. Apyrase had similar inhibitory effects. Scanning electronmicroscopy showed that direct contacts of platelets with HMV-1 cells could be demonstrated when platelet-platelet interaction was inhibited by 7E3 or apyrase. These results may indicate that, at a shear stress of 12 dyne/cm2, direct contacts of platelets and HMV-1 cells may trigger enhancement of platelet aggregation. ",0
"Induction of arthritis in rats by aqueous suspensions of mycobacteria without the use of oil. We report for the first time the induction of arthritis by an aqueous, rather than an oil, suspension of killed tubercle bacilli. This was accomplished in the highly susceptible dark Agouti strain of rats, by intraperitoneal injection during the healing phase of chemically induced peritonitis. The same procedure (injection after the induction of peritonitis) augmented the incidence of arthritis produced by bovine type II collagen and Freund's complete adjuvant. Enhanced delivery of antigen from the peritoneal cavity to regional lymph nodes in the postinflammatory state was responsible for this increase in the induction of arthritis. ",0
"Rectovulvar fistula in a child secondary to an unusual foreign body. Foreign bodies in the female genital tract are well recognized as a cause of pain, discharge, secretions, and infection. In the small child, the presence of a vaginal discharge is usually associated with either a common object which has been inserted or sexual abuse complicated by a sexually transmitted disease. A 3-year-old child presented with a recurrent labial secretion and drainage due to an unusual foreign body. It was only during a second operation that the possibility of a foreign body was entertained, and diagnostic testing was begun. A third operation permitted removal of the foreign body, a large bone probably of animal origin. The fistula tract was closed after a colostomy was performed. This represents the first reported case of a rectovulvar fistula not of a congenital nature. ",0
"The Dolenc technique for cavernous sinus exploration (cadaveric prosection). Technical note. This report describes a surgical approach to the cavernous sinus. Based on the work of Parkinson, Dolenc, and other pioneering investigators, a comprehensive surgical approach for the treatment of lesions of the cavernous sinus is distilled and presented in 12 simple steps. The approach to surgical exploration of this region is divided into an extradural and intradural phase, each with six steps. The bony, neural, and/or vascular structures of each step are discussed. These steps may be used in their entirety for total exploration of the cavernous sinus, but also in part for lesions that involve only limited regions of the cavernous sinus. Either by design or circumstance, every intracranial neurosurgeon will eventually be led to the cavernous sinus region, and a clear understanding of cavernous sinus anatomy should be part of their armamentarium.

"Tamm-Horsfall autoantibodies in interstitial cystitis. Interstitial cystitis presents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Although many etiologies, including autoimmunity, have been proposed its pathogenesis remains obscure. Tamm-Horsfall protein has been identified in the superficial urothelium of patients with interstitial cystitis demonstrating abnormal urothelial permeability. Eight patients with a clinical diagnosis of interstitial cystitis underwent cystoscopy and bladder biopsy. Characteristic cystoscopic findings were present, and each patient had chronic inflammation and mast cells by histopathological analysis. Preoperative anti-Tamm-Horsfall protein serum antibody (IgG) titers were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (range 500 to 8,000, mean 2,750). A control group of 8 patients with a negative urological history also had titers of 0 to 500 (p = 0.02). The humoral response to Tamm-Horsfall protein in these patients suggests a role for Tamm-Horsfall protein in interstitial cystitis. Measurement of serum Tamm-Horsfall protein antibody may prove to be useful as a noninvasive diagnostic test in patients with this disease. ",0
"Haemorheological changes in patients with retinal vein occlusion after isovolaemic haemodilution. In 83 patients with central retinal vein occlusion and branch vein occlusion we measured the haematocrit (HCT), plasma viscosity (PV), red cell aggregation (RCA), red cell filterability (RCF) and apparent whole blood viscosity (WBV). A control group (n = 41) was matched for sex, age, and cardiovascular risk factors. Measurements were performed before and after treatment with isovolaemic haemodilution (IHD). We found no significant differences between patients with retinal vein occlusion (RVO) and control subjects in haematocrit, plasma viscosity, red cell aggregation, and red cell filterability and no increased whole blood viscosity in the patient group. Patients with ischaemic retinal vein occlusion and non-ischaemic retinal vein occlusion did not show different haemorheological parameters either. After treatment with haemodilution, only the haematocrit and whole blood viscosity were significantly decreased, and there were no changes in plasma viscosity, red cell aggregation or red cell filterability.

"Blood pressure response to dietary calcium intervention in humans. Epidemiological and experimental studies have suggested that dietary calcium deficiency may lead to the development of hypertension. This article reviews findings in human trials on calcium intervention with special reference to the responses of blood pressure and biochemical variables. Calcium supplementation consistently resulted in decreased blood pressure in a subset of hypertensive and normotensive subjects, but led to increased blood pressure in some hypertensive patients. The variable blood pressure responses to calcium supplementation could not be predicted on the basis of routine biochemical parameters and appeared to be due to differences in the backgrounds of the subjects and/or the design and size of the trials. It is concluded that further studies are required on the hypotensive effect of calcium supplementation. ",0
"Intraocular lens complications. The authors implanted intraocular lenses (IOL) in 780 eyes and considered complications of this surgery, dividing the complications into intraoperative and postoperative, the latter early and late. The most frequent intraoperative complications were: hyphema, vitreous injury, pupil deformation with an IOL in the anterior chamber (AC), and hyphema and corneal lesions with an IOL in the posterior chamber (PC). Among the early postoperative complications of an IOL in the AC the authors noticed striate keratopathy and uveal flare and postoperative transitory ocular hypertension and striate keratitis with an IOL in the PC. Moreover, in late postoperative complications in AC implantation they observed: cystoid macular edema, bullous keratitis, retinal detachment, late uveitis, opacification of posterior capsule, eccentric displacement of the IOL, and less frequently, cystoid macular edema in PC implantations. The authors prefer IOL implantation in the PC after extracapsular cataract extraction, since this surgery causes less problems in the cornea, vitreous, and retina. ",0
"Prognosis and treatment of advanced squamous cell carcinoma secondary to epidermodysplasia verruciformis: a worldwide analysis of 11 patients. Data were collected from three medical centers in the USA, Poland, and Japan regarding 11 patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) secondary to epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV). Analysis was conducted regarding primary tumor location, age at onset of EV, age at diagnosis of SCC, treatment of SCC, history of local tumor recurrence, presence of metastases, and age at death. Three of 11 patients developed both lymph node and visceral metastases and the mean patient age at death was 44 years (N = 6) with no patient to date living past 54 years. Mean patient survival time following metastases was 1.7 years (N = 2). Human papilloma virus typing of nine patients was performed. Current controversies regarding the treatment of patients with advanced SCC in the setting of EV are reviewed. ",0
"Radiation-associated valvular disease. The prevalence of radiation-associated cardiac disease is increasing due to prolonged survival following mediastinal irradiation. Side effects of radiation include pericarditis, accelerated coronary artery disease, myocardial fibrosis and valvular injury. We evaluated the cases of three young patients with evidence of significant valvular disease following mediastinal irradiation. One patient underwent the first reported successful aortic and mitral valve replacement for radiation-associated valvular disease (RAVD) as well as concurrent coronary artery revascularization. A review of the literature revealed 35 reported cases of RAVD, with only one successful case of valve replacement that was limited to the aortic valve. Asymptomatic RAVD is diagnosed 11.5 years after mediastinal irradiation compared with 16.5 years for symptomatic patients, emphasizing that long-term follow-up is important for patients receiving mediastinal irradiation. This study defines a continuum of valvular disease following radiation that begins with mild asymptomatic valvular thickening and progresses to severe valvular fibrosis with hemodynamic compromise requiring surgical intervention.

"Retro-orbicularis oculus fat (ROOF) resection in aesthetic blepharoplasty: a 6-year study in 63 patients Sixty-three nonconsecutive patients have undergone resection of the retro-orbicularis oculus fat (ROOF) in conjunction with aesthetic blepharoplasty. In these patients, a consistent and useful ability to soften and flatten heaviness and bulkiness in the lateral upper orbital region was seen. Two patients developed postoperative hematoma, and two different patients had transient dry-eye symptoms following blepharoplasty. Twenty percent of patients had a transient degree of numbness in the lateral supraorbital nerve region, and all patients noted some transient numbness over the lateral upper brow region. No patient demonstrated significant paralysis of the orbicularis oculus or corrugator muscle. From this experience, retro-orbicularis oculus fat resection would appear to be a useful adjunct to standard blepharoplasty techniques in selected patients. ",0
"Allopurinol and thiazide effects on new urinary stone formed after discontinued therapy in patients with urinary stones. We treated 87 patients with calcium-containing urinary stones with either allopurinol alone (44 patients) or in combination with thiazide (43 patients) and studied new stone formation before, during, and after the discontinuation of the drug therapy. The number of stones formed were 1.18, 0.24, and 0.13 before, during, and after discontinuation of the drug therapy, respectively, in the patients treated with allopurinol alone and 1.32, 0.20, and 0.09 in those treated in combination with thiazide. No differences were observed in these values and the duration of each observation period between the two groups. Decreases in the incidence of stone formation even after interruption of drug therapy suggested that recurrence-preventive effects observed following administration of these drugs include the effects of medical guidance. However, allopurinol therapy was effective in preventing recurrence in patients with hyperuricosuria. ",0
"Safe performance of difficult laparoscopic cholecystectomies. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has been advocated for the treatment of uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease, but has not been widely advocated for the management of more complicated gallbladder disease such as acute cholecystitis, previous surgery, or common duct stones. During the last 9 months, 360 patients underwent laparoscopic removal of their gallbladder. A total of 138 had a complicated presentation, making surgery more difficult. This article discusses the management of these patients with acute cholecystitis, previous surgery, or common duct disease. Using the described techniques, there were no complications or mortality. Laparoscopic management of difficult gallbladder problems is safe and effective. ",0
"Upper-airway obstruction after multilevel cervical corpectomy for myelopathy. We reviewed the cases of seven patients who had had obstruction of the upper airway immediately after an anterior procedure on the cervical spine and had required reintubation. All patients had had moderate or severe myelopathy preoperatively (average, 3.6 on the Nurick scale), and all had had a multilevel anterior cervical corpectomy for decompression followed by arthrodesis. The early compromise of the upper airway was believed to be due to edema rather than to the formation of a hematoma. Five patients had no sequelae, but two died of complications related to the obstruction. Risk factors common to these patients included moderate or severe myelopathy and multilevel corpectomy. Six patients had a history of heavy smoking and one, of asthma. We believe that extra caution should be used in the postoperative management of the airways when multilevel corpectomy is performed in patients who have these pre-existing conditions. ",0
"Gastroesophageal reflux and sclerotherapy strictures. The development of esophageal stricture is common following endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy (EVS). Gastroesophageal reflux may be at least partly responsible. Twelve randomly selected male patients underwent chronic EVS for the management of bleeding esophageal varices. Six patients developed strictures during or after EVS, six did not. There were no significant differences between stricture and nonstricture patients during 24 hour esophageal pH monitoring. Three of the six stricture patients and four of the six nonstricture patients had an abnormal amount of reflux. Gastroesophageal reflux occurs frequently in patients undergoing EVS, and it is not likely to play a major role in EVS stricture formation. ",0
"Histologic investigation of vascular malformations of the face after transarterial embolization with ethibloc and other agents. Twenty-one vascular malformations located in the facial area, 11 high-flow arteriovenous malformations and 10 slow-flow malformations, underwent combined treatment by embolization and later surgery. Embolization was performed simultaneously with superselective angiography of the branches of the external carotid artery. The new biodegradable fibrosing agent Ethibloc was used in 16 cases. Histologic examination of the surgical specimens confirmed the good target orientation by the transarterial injection of Ethibloc. Limitations of this technique are discussed. The agent proved to have thrombogenic and fibrogenic properties. Some of the vascular walls degenerated and ruptured following the embolization, but there were no instances of necrosis of interstitial tissue or skin. Embolization treatment of vascular malformations of the face was not curative, but it facilitated subsequent surgery in all examined cases. ",0
"A clonal CD4-positive T-cell line established from the blood of a patient with Sezary syndrome. The reported inability to establish long-term T-cell lines from the blood of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma patients with circulating neoplastic T cells has hindered the development of an in vitro system to investigate Sezary syndrome. We have established a rapidly proliferating T-cell line from the peripheral blood of a patient with Sezary syndrome, which expresses a mature helper T-cell phenotype and contains cytogenetic abnormalities and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements identical to those in the patient's blood. The method of establishment and characteristics of this line are described. ",0
"Prophylaxis of deep venous thrombosis after acute abdominal operation. Two hundred and forty-five patients who underwent acute extensive abdominal operations were randomized into three regimens to achieve optimal prophylaxis of postoperative thromboembolic complications. All of the patients were screened by the 125I-fibrinogen uptake test for seven days and if the phlebographic findings were positive. Of 81 patients receiving low dose heparin, 12 had thromboembolism. Of 79 receiving a combination of low dose heparin and graded compression stockings, two had thromboembolism, and of 85 receiving a combination of dextran and graded compression stockings, 13 had this complication. This difference is significant in favor of the second treatment (p = 0.013). It is concluded that the combination of low dose heparin and graded compression stockings is an effective way to prevent thromboembolism after acute abdominal operations. ",0
"Management of urinary tract infections in children. Urinary tract infection is common in children. The presentation varies with age. Younger children exhibit protean signs. Diagnosis is dependent on the demonstration of significant bacteriuria in a properly collected and handled urine sample. The approach to treatment depends on the degree of illness at presentation, the presence of structural urinary tract abnormalities, and the age of the patient. Pathophysiology of urinary tract infection is dependent on interactive factors of the host and of the invading microorganism. Urinary tract abnormalities have significant impact on the management of children with urinary tract infections, both medically and surgically. Of particular importance is the observation that renal damage usually occurs within the first 5 years of life, and treatment delay in some young patients may have significant consequences. The overall prognosis in children with urinary tract infection is favorable. ",0
Pancreaticobiliary ductal union. The main pancreatic duct and the common bile duct open into the second part of the duodenum alone or after joining as a common channel. A common channel of greater than 15 mm (an anomalous pancreaticobiliary duct) is associated with congenital cystic dilatation of the common bile duct and carcinoma of the gall bladder. Even a long common channel (greater than or equal to 8 mm) is associated with a higher frequency of carcinoma of the gall bladder. Gall stones smaller than the common channel and a long common channel predispose to gall stone induced acute pancreatitis. Separate openings for the two ductal systems predisposes to development of gall stones and alcohol induced chronic pancreatitis. The role of ductal union has also been investigated in primary sclerosing cholangitis and biliary atresia. ,0
"The role of ERCP in children and adolescents. The diagnostic and therapeutic role of ERCP in 42 patients ranging from 1 to 19 years of age is discussed. ERCP provided useful additional information in 15 patients with biliary tract disease, 15 patients with pancreatic disease, and 9 patients with abdominal pain. The appropriate duct was cannulated in 95% of cases. Mild pancreatitis occurred in two patients after ERCP. Endoscopic papillotomy was successful in five patients. ERCP plays an important part in the investigation of unexplained biliary tract and pancreatic disease. It rarely demonstrates abnormal pathology in patients with otherwise unexplained abdominal pain.

"Mitral valve disruption following percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty. Two cases of massive mitral regurgitation due to mitral valve disruption following percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty are reported. This severe complication occurred in two elderly women with recurrent mitral stenosis after previous surgical commissurotomy. Due to their unstable hemodynamic and clinical condition, both patients underwent emergency valve replacement. At surgery, the commissures appeared fused and heavily calcified; the chordae tendineae thickened, shortened, and fused; and the leaflets presented a large tear with sheared edges. Because the technical aspects of both procedures were unremarkable, the anatomic features of the mitral valve seemed to affect the occurrence of severe mitral regurgitation. Percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty should be therefore applied carefully to patients with prior surgical valvotomy, in whom the structural alterations of the mitral apparatus may predispose to severe valvular damage.

"Emergency laparoscopy. Unnecessary abdominal explorations in severely injured patients can be reduced by employing emergent or urgent laparoscopy in blunt abdominal trauma and the obscured, acute abdominal cases. In 150 blunt abdominal trauma cases, a mini-laparoscopy was used in the emergency room or the intensive care unit without major complications. In 56%, the findings were negative. In 19%, the laparoscopic findings were corroborated by surgery. In 25%, a minimal to moderate hemoperitoneum was found and the laparoscopic impression dictated close observation. Unnecessary exploration was avoided except in one case. In the elderly high-risk patient with a poor history, abdominal examination can be noninformative. Laparoscopy can detect acute appendicitis or organ perforation. In the young female, appendicitis can be differentiated from pelvic inflammatory disease. Laparoscopy is more accurate and gives a larger latitude for decision-making than lavage. It can also be useful in the obscured problematic abdominal case. ",0
"Gallbladder perforation and bile leakage: percutaneous treatment. Three patients with spontaneous gallbladder perforation and one with an iatrogenic bile leak causing bile peritonitis were treated successfully by means of percutaneous catheter drainage. Three patients had cholelithiasis as the cause of perforation; the fourth patient had previously undergone gallstone dissolution with methyl tert-butyl ether lavage and developed bile peritonitis a few hours after removal of the catheter. In three patients, a percutaneous cholecystostomy catheter provided successful decompression; in the fourth patient, drainage was performed with a percutaneous sump catheter in the subhepatic space adjacent to the gallbladder. No specific complications occurred. Follow-up was performed at 1, 12, 22, and 59 months, respectively. To date, one of the four patients has undergone elective cholecystectomy (1 month after drainage). The remainder of the patients are asymptomatic. This preliminary experience suggests that the severe complication of gallbladder perforation and bile leakage may be treated, at least temporarily, by means of percutaneous drainage. ",0
"Reconstruction of mandibular defects in irradiated patients. In this prospective study, mandibular reconstruction using titanium plates was evaluated in 31 patients treated between July 1988 and January 1990. Sixteen patients had prior surgery; 13 had prior radiotherapy. In 11 patients, prior radiation and surgery had failed. Sixteen patients received postoperative radiotherapy either in standard or accelerated fractions. Twelve patients had complications of either intraoral (8), extraoral (5), or combined (1) plate exposure or fistula formation (2). Factors significantly related to complications were poor nutrition, accelerated radiation, and recurrence. Sixty-one percent of all patients healed uneventfully. When patients with complications secondary to recurrence who subsequently died were excluded, the success rate was 73%. Only one patient had an unacceptable result that produced a cosmetic and functional deformity despite secondary repair. ",0
"Apparent reduction in the size of one side of the face associated with a small retrosplenial haemorrhage. A 68 year old Japanese female with unilateral metamorphopsia of the face that developed after a small haemorrhage in the contralateral retrosplenial region, is described. The patient claimed that the right side of a face, that is, the left side when looked at by the patient, appeared smaller than the left. In addition, her drawings of the face showed some distortions. Objects other than the face were perceived normally. Cranial CT scan revealed a small high density area in the right retrosplenial region. The face appears to have a special representation in the posterior hemisphere. ",0
"Work and power in gait of stroke patients. Biomechanical analysis of the work and power patterns involved in gait provides insight into the nature of gait deficits and suggests methods for improvement. The purpose of this study was to describe the work and power characteristics during gait for both limbs of hemiplegic patients, and to determine the work and power variables related to self-selected speeds of walking. The gait of 30 ambulatory adults between the ages of 47 and 79 years was studied using two-dimensional cinematography and force-plate data in a link-segment model. About 40% of the positive work required for walking was performed by the muscles of the affected side. Major contributors were the ankle plantar flexors, hip flexors, and hip extensors. The results suggest interdependence between the limbs and between muscle groups of the same limb; a need for further research is indicated. ",0
"Aggressive granulomatous lesions in cementless total hip arthroplasty. We describe six patients with aggressive granulomatous lesions around cementless total hip prostheses. Two patients previously had a cemented prosthesis in the same hip. The Lord prosthesis was used in five patients, the PCA in one. Both prostheses were made of chrome-cobalt alloy. Pain on weight-bearing occurred on average 3.2 years after the cementless arthroplasty, and at that time radiography revealed aggressive granulomatosis around the proximal femoral stem and the acetabular component in five of the patients; one had a large solitary granuloma in the proximal femur. Revision was performed on average 4.8 years after the cementless arthroplasty. At that time all granulomas had grown large in size; while waiting for revision operation, two femoral stem components fractured. All the granulomas showed a uniform histopathology, which included histiocytosis; the cause for these lesions was thought to be plastic debris from the acetabular socket. ",0
"Can the blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio distinguish upper from lower gastrointestinal bleeding? We wanted to know if the blood urea nitrogen to creatinine (BUN/Cr) ratio could help distinguish upper from lower gastrointestinal bleeding. We analyzed retrospectively patients admitted to our hospital for gastrointestinal bleeding over the past 5 years. A total of 126 patients represented 74 upper bleeds and 52 lower bleeds. The mean BUN/Cr ratio was significantly higher in upper than lower bleeders, 34.8 and 17.8 respectively (p less than 0.001). No lower bleeder had a ratio of greater than or equal to 36, whereas 38% of upper bleeders had a ratio of greater than or equal to 36. The BUN/Cr ratio may be an easy, cheap method of distinguishing upper from lower gastrointestinal bleeding in some cases. A BUN/Cr ratio of greater than or equal to 36 suggests upper gastrointestinal bleeding, whereas a ratio of less than 36 is not helpful in locating the source of bleeding. ",0
"Acute syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis. Six patients with evidence of secondary syphilis presented with visual loss in both eyes caused by large, placoid, yellowish lesions with faded centers at the level of the pigment epithelium in the macula and juxtapapillary areas. All eyes had vitreitis. All of the lesions showed a similar fluorescein angiographic pattern of early hypofluorescence and late staining. Five patients had mucocutaneous lesions typical of secondary syphilis. All five patients treated with antibiotics had prompt improvement in visual function and resolution of the fundus lesions. The ophthalmoscopic and angiographic appearance of these posterior fundus lesions was sufficiently characteristic to suggest a diagnosis of secondary syphilis. Modification of the host response to syphilis by human immune deficiency virus (HIV) infection may be partly responsible for this peculiar fundus picture. Three of the four patients tested positive for HIV. ",0
"Circadian variations in myocardial ischemia. Implications for management. Extended ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring in the patient's customary environment provides clear evidence of circadian patterns in myocardial ischemic episodes. In patients with effort angina, the highest activity occurs between 6 AM and noon. This coincides with peaks in diurnal variation of frequency of acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and sudden death. A number of potential underlying common triggering mechanisms, including catecholamine secretion, sympathetic nervous system activity, blood pressure, heart rate, cortisol secretion, and aggregability of platelets, exhibit similar surges. As a result of these coinciding morning peaks, myocardial oxygen demand is increased and oxygen supply reduced after a person arises in the morning. Attention to this vulnerable period is merited in the timing and choice of medication, both to prevent or reduce ischemia and to modify potential disease-triggering mechanisms. ",0
"The immunoperoxidase localization of tumour markers in ovarian cancer: the value of CEA, EMA, cytokeratin and DD9. Primary tumours from 40 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, treated at St Thomas's Hospital over a 10-year period, were studied for the immunocytochemical expression of the following tumour markers in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded material: carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), cytokeratin (CAM 5.2), and DD9. An indirect immunoperoxidase staining technique was used. All of the tumours were positive for EMA and CAM 5.2, and 30% of them were positive for both CEA and DD9. The absence of CEA and DD9 may be of value in differentiating between metastatic abdominal adenocarcinomas of ovarian origin and those of gastrointestinal origin, but no indication of prognosis was obtained using these epithelial markers. The strong and widespread staining of all the tumours for EMA suggests that this may be a useful marker for detecting metastatic or recurrent disease by immunoscintigraphy. ",0
"Fibromyalgia in human immunodeficiency virus infection. Tenderness was assessed by point count and by scored palpation in 51 patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection as well as 51 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 50 patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Fifteen of 51 (29%) patients with HIV infection met criteria for fibromyalgia, based on the presence of 10 tender (of 14) ""fibrositic"" points. Similar results were observed among patients with PsA (24%). The prevalence of fibromyalgia was higher among patients with RA (57%). Patients with HIV and PsA were less tender than patients with RA. Fibromyalgia in patients with HIV was significantly associated with myalgia and arthralgia, but not with age, duration of HIV infection, stage of HIV disease, or zidovudine therapy. ",0
"Radical vulvectomy with partial rectal resection and temporary colostomy as primary therapy for selected patients with vulvar carcinoma. The patient with carcinoma of the vulva may present with tumor involvement of the perirectal area. Traditional treatment has often involved ultraradical therapy including a radical vulvectomy with posterior or total pelvic exenteration in an effort to obtain adequate surgical margins. Five-year survival rates for these patients range from 20-50%, and major operative morbidity as well as psychological problems are associated with this extensive surgery. Five patients treated for a locally advanced vulvar carcinoma involving the perirectal area were thought to be candidates for a rectum-sparing procedure. They underwent a radical vulvectomy, bilateral inguinal lymphadenectomy, partial rectal resection, and a diverting colostomy. Four of the five patients agreed to a colostomy closure 6 months after their primary therapy; these four patients have resumed normal bowel function. All patients remain clinically free of tumor. ",0
"Cytogenetic damage induced by folate deficiency in mice is enhanced by caffeine. Folate deficiency in Swiss mice increased the incidence of micronuclei in peripheral blood erythrocytes, indicating increased chromosomal damage in nucleated erythrocyte precursors. Caffeine enhanced the incidence of micronuclei in blood and bone marrow by up to 5-fold in folate-deficient mice at doses that did not significantly alter the micronucleus frequency in the presence of adequate dietary folate. The lower dose of caffeine used in this study (75 mg/kg) approaches doses received by humans who consume large amounts of caffeinated beverages. Since folate deficiency and caffeine consumption are highly prevalent in the human population, the potential for a similar interaction in man should be evaluated. ",0
"Pericardial metastasis from testicular seminoma: appearance and disappearance by echocardiography. At the time of initial diagnosis, testicular malignancy is usually limited to the testicle and infradiaphragmatic lymph nodes. Metastases initially follow the retroperitoneal lymph channels and subsequently extend to the supradiphragmatic lymph nodes in the mediastinum and supraclavicular fossa. Testicular metastases to the pericardium are rare and usually asymptomatic. These lesions are most commonly identified at autopsy; therefore, the actual incidence is unknown. The authors report a 32-year-old man with testicular carcinoma, who developed asymptomatic pericardial metastases without concomitant supradiaphragmatic nodal or pulmonary metastases. They review the efficacy of echocardiography in diagnosis and follow up or pericardial metastasis. ",0
"Heart weights of white men 20 to 39 years of age. An analysis of 218 autopsy cases. Review of autopsy data for 218 white men between 20 and 39 years of age who died of injuries or suddenly and unexpectedly indicated a mean heart weight of 371 g. The mean for those dying of external causes was 364 g whereas the mean for those dying of natural causes was 446 g. A coefficient for heart weight expressed as a percentage of body weight was lower in heavy individuals than lightweight individuals; it ranged between 0.38% and 0.55%, with a mean of 0.48%. Heart weight, including epicardial fat, increased with age and body weight. These data may be useful to those who are called upon to investigate sudden and unexpected deaths. ",0
"Hypertension in African-Americans. A considerable disparity exists between African-Americans and US Caucasians in the incidence, severity, and management of hypertension. As a consequence, overall hypertension-related morbidity and mortality rates are at least threefold to fivefold higher in African-Americans than in Caucasians. Alarmingly high frequencies of stroke, end-stage renal disease, congestive heart failure, and left ventricular hypertrophy occur in African-Americans. To bring this crisis under control will require a renewed commitment to expanded research, improved public health measures, and more effective clinical intervention. Current hypertension control programs must be expanded and adequately funded. In addition, primary prevention of hypertension should be strongly recommended for the US population, especially African-Americans. ",0
"The importance of calcium regulation in toxic cell injury. Studies utilizing the technology of digital imaging fluorescence microscopy. The regulation of ions within the cell is of critical importance in both acute and chronic toxicology. Recently, new methods have been developed for measuring such changes in living cells and correlating them with studies of structure, function, and biochemistry. A major revolution has occurred from the linkage between the computer and the light microscope, which has resulted in the use of digital imaging fluorescence microscopy and video intensification microscopy coupled with image analysis. These methods have already yielded much additional information and it is anticipated that their further application by pathologists and toxicologists will continue to uncover the important role of ion deregulation and toxic cell injury.

"Neurologic and psychiatric manifestations of HIV disease. Neuropsychiatric problems have assumed an increasingly prominent role in HIV-infected individuals. Disease occurs at all levels of the central and peripheral nervous systems by a variety of mechanisms. The AIDS dementia complex is the prototypical example of ""direct"" effects of HIV on the neuraxis, while infections such as toxoplasmosis and cryptococcal meningitis are complications of HIV-induced immunosuppression. Neurologic manifestations vary in frequency depending upon the overall stage of HIV disease; diagnostic difficulties may be encountered because of HIV's effect on cerebrospinal fluid parameters. The uncertainties of management of neurosyphilis in this setting provide and example of these problems. As is the case with other organ systems, the main goal of neurodiagnostic efforts is to find the increasing number of treatable components of neuropsychiatric dysfunction. ",0
"Carcinoid tumors. The authors carried out a retrospective study of 32 patients (23 M, 9 F) with carcinoid tumors who were diagnosed and treated at Harlem Hospital Center, New York, from 1967 to 1988. All the patients were black and the commonest sites were the ileum (28.1%), rectosigmoid and rectum (21.9%), and the appendix and lung (15.6% each). Metastasis correlated with site, size, and depth of the primary tumor and occurred in 12 patients (38%), most frequently to the regional lymph nodes and liver. Carcinoid syndrome developed in 12.5% (3 F, 1 M). Surgical resection for cure or palliation was the mainstay of treatment. Overall 5 year survival rate was 66%, and for those with metastases was 0%. The poorer survival rates are probably related to the socioeconomic status of our patient population. The only observed racial difference compared to other series is the preponderance of males, and the disproportionately higher ratio of females with the carcinoid syndrome. ",0
"Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the brain after Hodgkin's disease. An immunohistochemical study. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) of the central nervous system (CNS) is a rarely reported complication of Hodgkin's disease (HD). Two patients with NHL of the brain after HD were studied by histologic and immunohistochemical methods. Both patients were in the second decade, had been treated with radiation and chemotherapy, had experienced a relapse of HD before development of NHL, had no evidence of HD at the time of diagnosis of NHL, and died within 1 year of diagnosis. Both brain neoplasms were large cell immunoblastic lymphomas of B-cell lineage. Patients with HD appear to be at increased risk for NHL of the CNS, which may have a poor prognosis. ",0
"Endoscopic management of early supraglottic cancer. An initial endoscopic surgical approach to early supraglottic cancer provides the surgeon with the ability to accurately stage these lesions, avoiding possible undertreatment while allowing for a valuable treatment option for those supraglottic cancers with histologically incontrovertibly superficial disease. Early invasion of the preepiglottic and paraglottic spaces can be determined accurately without altering or delaying any treatment option (open surgical excision, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy). The tendency of supraglottic cancers to transgress the natural foramina of the epiglottis is well established, and the concern about this depth of invasion is reflected by the 1977 revised staging criteria, which required assessment of the preepiglottic space (PES). Along with the microscope and the carbon dioxide laser, the adjustable supraglottiscope facilitates the determination of PES invasion and facilitates en bloc excision of superficial supraglottic cancers. The resulting morbidity typically is no different from that with routine direct endoscopy and biopsy. ",0
"Comparative efficacy of short-term versus long-term cefoxitin prophylaxis against postoperative infection after radical hysterectomy: a prospective study. We report the results of a randomized, double-blind comparison of short-term versus long-term cefoxitin prophylaxis against infections after radical abdominal hysterectomy with pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy. Of 113 evaluable patients, 54 (47.8%) received short-term (three doses) and 59 (52.2%) long-term (12 doses) prophylaxis with intravenous cefoxitin (2 g per dose). No significant differences in demographics, preoperative risk factors, or clinical course were detected between the two groups; nor did we detect significant differences in the incidence of surgical-site-related infections (7.4 versus 5.1%, respectively, P = .61), postoperative urinary tract infection, or other febrile morbidity. We conclude that short-term and long-term cefoxitin prophylaxis are equally effective for the prevention of post-operative surgical-site-related infections after radical hysterectomy. ",0
"Spindle and epithelioid cell nevus (Spitz nevus). Natural history following biopsy. A clinical follow-up study of 49 cases of spindle and epithelioid cell nevus is presented to address the question about the potential for local recurrence. Only 19 (39%) of the 49 lesions were initially excised en toto, and the remainder (30 cases) had positive margins; six of the latter spindle and epithelioid cell nevi were reexcised, and no evidence of a residual nevus was found in five of the six cases. There were no recurrences in the 49 patients during an average follow-up period of 5.0 years (range, 1 to 10 years). The rarity of recurrent spindle and epithelioid cell nevus would justify a conservative approach to management, with clinical follow-up alone recommended after a subtotal excision, when the pathologic diagnosis is unequivocal.

"Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase score in patients with cerebrovascular disease and in patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors. Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) activity in peripheral blood was determined in 54 patients with cerebrovascular disease (CVD), 11 patients with primary brain tumor, and 23 patients with metastatic brain tumor. The LAP score of the primary brain tumor patients (155 +/- 40) was significantly higher (P less than 0.03) than the LAP score for cerebrovascular disease patients (96 +/- 87). The LAP score levels of the metastatic brain tumor patients (251 +/- 55) was significantly higher as compared with both the cerebrovascular disease (P less than 0.001) and primary brain tumor groups (P less than 0.001). The LAP score could serve as an additional, although non-specific, marker to assist in the differentiation between cerebrovascular disease and brain tumors. ",0
Enhanced expression of c-myc and H-ras oncogenes in Letterer-Siwe disease. A sequential study using colorimetric in situ hybridization. Tissues from two patients with disseminated histiocytosis X (Letterer-Siwe disease) in which histiocytosis X cells exhibited histologic and cytologic features of malignancy were evaluated by in situ hybridization with the use of biotinylated nucleic acid probes to c-myc and H-ras oncogenes. Enhanced expression of these oncogenes was observed in mononucleated and multinucleated cells of histiocytosis X in the terminal proliferative phase but not in the early quiescent phase of Letterer-Siwe disease in both patients. Our findings indicate that deregulation of c-myc and H-ras in histiocytosis X are late events that likely confer a selective growth advantage to histiocytosis X cells. ,0
"Gastric contents retained in rat stomach following mild irritant exposure contribute to adaptive cytoprotection. Fluid retained in the gastric lumen immediately preceding the administration of a damaging product will dilute that product and decrease its injurious capacity. In an attempt to explain the phenomenon of adaptive cytoprotection, we studied the effect of mild irritant exposure on the volume of fluid retained in the gastric lumen. Rats treated with 0.2 N-0.4 N HCl had a larger volume of gastric fluid retained as compared to animals treated with 0.4 N NaCl. Additionally, a mixture of gastric juice derived from rats exposed to 0.4 N HCl with 2 ml ethanol was significantly less damaging to the gastric mucosa than a similar mixture containing an equal volume of gastric juice derived from 0.4 N NaCl-exposed rats. We conclude from our observations that in mild irritant-exposed stomachs, the gastric juice is a main contributor to the protection against ethanol injury. ",0
"Non-vesicular release of glutamate from glial cells by reversed electrogenic glutamate uptake. Glutamate uptake into nerve and glial cells usually functions to keep the extracellular glutamate concentration low in the central nervous system. But one component of glutamate release from neurons is calcium-independent, suggesting a non-vesicular release that may be due to a reversal of glutamate uptake. The activity of the electrogenic glutamate uptake carrier can be monitored by measuring the membrane current it produces, and uptake is activated by intracellular potassium ions. Here we report that raising the potassium concentration around glial cells evokes an outward current component produced by reversed glutamate uptake. This current is activated by intracellular glutamate and sodium, inhibited by extracellular glutamate and sodium, and increased by membrane depolarization. These results demonstrate a non-vesicular mechanism for the release of glutamate from glial cells and neurons. This mechanism may contribute to the neurotoxic rise in extracellular glutamate concentration during brain anoxia. ",0
"Major histocompatibility complex antigen expression in the affected tissues in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Monoclonal antibody immunocytochemistry was used to examine spinal cord and muscle in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis for changes that would indicate ongoing or potential immune activity. Increased expression of class I and II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens was seen in the affected areas of spinal cord. New MHC expression was concentrated in phagocytes, particularly in degenerating white matter in which they were dispersed in the tissue and also packed around blood vessels. MHC antigen was not revealed in motor neurons or skeletal muscle fibers. An anti-pan-T-cell monoclonal revealed small numbers of T cells in degenerating white matter. Similar changes have been seen in other neurodegenerative disorders. They suggest a potential for (secondary) cell-mediated activity in the affected areas rather than an ongoing MHC-restricted T-cell response. Vessel-associated phagocytes may be a source of antigen to peripheral lymphoid tissue, stimulating production of the autoantibodies that have been described. ",0
"Management of selected cystic adnexal masses in postmenopausal women by operative laparoscopy: a pilot study. Twenty-five postmenopausal patients were predicted to have benign masses by screening criteria that included ultrasonographic findings of a cystic adnexal mass less than 10 cm with distinct borders and no evidence of irregular solid parts, thick septa, ascites, or matted bowel, and a normal serum CA 125 value (less than 35 U/ml). All 25 masses were accurately predicted to be benign. The size of the cysts on ultrasonography ranged from 3 to 9 cm with a mean of 5 cm. Twenty-two patients (88%) were successfully managed by operative laparoscopy and adnexectomy. Mean operative time was 70 minutes and mean postoperative hospital stay was 12 hours. Mean time of return to normal activity was 5 days. Three patients required laparotomy. We conclude that removal of these cystic adnexal masses by operative laparoscopy is an acceptable alternative in carefully selected postmenopausal women. ",0
"Perivascular innervation of the cerebral arteries in spontaneously hypertensive rats--an immunohistochemical study. Perivascular innervation in cerebral arteries of spontaneously hypertensive rats and of normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats was studied. Adrenergic nerve fibers and neuropeptide Y-containing nerve fibers, indicative of vasoconstrictor nerves, were denser in all cerebral arteries of spontaneously hypertensive rats than those of Wistar-Kyoto rats. In contrast, cholinergic nerve fibers and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, substance P-containing nerve fibers, indicative of vasodilator nerves, remained unchanged in all cerebral arteries of spontaneously hypertensive rats, as compared with findings in the Wistar-Kyoto rats. Thus, not only adrenergic nerve fibers but also neuropeptide Y-containing nerve fibers may play an important role in preventing the disruption of the blood-brain barrier and the development of hypertensive encephalopathy in spontaneously hypertensive rats.

"Lung injury in a surfactant-deficient lung is modified by indomethacin. Repetitive total lung lavage in adult rabbits leads to a reproducible severe surfactant-deficient lung injury. Hypoxemia requiring mechanical ventilation occurs, accompanied by a substantial pulmonary hypertension, a large intra-alveolar protein leak, peripheral neutropenia, and pathological features of marked neutrophil infiltration with extensive hyaline membrane formation. Pretreatment with indomethacin abolishes postlavage pulmonary hypertension, preserves a slightly better lung function with higher arterial PO2, and prevents the postlavage peripheral neutropenia found in untreated animals. Pretreatment with a thromboxane A2 receptor blocker (L 655,240, Merck Frosst, Canada) also completely attenuated pulmonary hypertension, providing evidence that thromboxane A2 mediates pulmonary arterial hypertension after lung lavage. However, specific thromboxane receptor blockade had no other long-lasting beneficial effects on the ongoing injury in this model. ",0
"The acute lupus hemophagocytic syndrome [published erratum appears in Ann Intern Med 1991 Jun 1;114(11):993] OBJECTIVE: To characterize an unusual mode of presentation of systemic lupus erythematosus: acute and severe pancytopenia related to reactive hemophagocytosis. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: Two general community hospitals in Hong Kong. PATIENTS: Six patients presenting with a reactive hemophagocytic syndrome, identified over a 3.5 year period, diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus according to the criteria of the American Rheumatism Association. RESULTS: In addition to severe pancytopenia and marrow hemophagocytosis, other characteristic features were fever, hypocomplementemia, high antinuclear antibody titer, and cutaneous and visceral vasculitis. There was no evidence of an underlying infection. The pancytopenia responded dramatically to treatment with steroids. CONCLUSION: Recognition of the acute lupus hemophagocytic syndrome and distinction from an infection-associated hemophagocytic syndrome is important because it responds well to steroid therapy. The evaluation of patients presenting with a hemophagocytic syndrome should include serologic tests for systemic lupus erythematosus. ",0
"Early-onset dementia and extrapyramidal disease: clinicopathological variant of Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker or Alzheimer's disease? A case of progressive dementia and extrapyramidal signs beginning at age 29, with a ten year course until death, is presented. Necropsy examination showed an assortment of plaque types (including striatal plaques), neurofibrillary tangles, granulovacuolar degeneration, and depigmentation of the substantia nigra and locus ceruleus. This case had pathological features found in both Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease and in Alzheimer's disease. While somewhat similar to several other cases with features of both diseases, it differs in the presence of dystonia and striatal plaques. Although such cases may be difficult to categorize at present, they must be considered in the differential diagnosis of early onset dementia. ",0
"Plasma histamine in patients with chronic renal failure and nephrotic syndrome. Plasma histamine concentrations were measured using a commercially available monoclonal antibody radioimmunoassay in 38 patients with nephrotic syndrome, end stage renal failure, those receiving haemodialysis, and those receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis to determine whether histamine may mediate damage to glomerular capillaries and arterial endothelium. Plasma histamine concentrations were significantly increased in all four patient groups when compared with those of controls and were the highest in two patients with pruritus. Raised plasma histamine concentrations in such patients are consistent with the hypothesis that histamine may contribute to the damage to glomerular capillaries and to arterial endothelium. These effects may be relevant to the pathogenesis of glomerular disease and atherosclerosis. Histamine may also contribute to the pathogenesis of pruritus in patients with chronic renal failure. ",0
"Value of ventricular electrogram recordings in the diagnosis of arrhythmias precipitating electrical device shock therapy. An antitachycardia pacemaker-cardioverter-defibrillator that is capable of storing ventricular electrograms before and after delivery of device shock therapy was implanted in 16 patients. Three of the patients experienced out-of-hospital device shock therapy preceded by minimal symptoms. Although limitations of electrogram analysis exist and are discussed, careful analysis and registration of electrograms during all supraventricular and ventricular rhythms observed during in-hospital testing served as an important reference for subsequent arrhythmia diagnosis. By analyzing the electrogram rate and RR interval stability and configuration, a definitive diagnosis was established in all three patients (atrial fibrillation, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and rate-sensing lead disruption, respectively). Thus, the ability to store ventricular electrograms before shock therapy represents a major advance in the management of patients who receive an electrical device to treat ventricular tachyarrhythmia.

"A controlled trial of psychological treatment for the irritable bowel syndrome. One hundred two patients with irritable bowel syndrome were studied in a controlled trial of psychological treatment involving psychotherapy, relaxation, and standard medical treatment compared with standard medical treatment alone. Patients were only selected if their symptoms had not improved with standard medical treatment over the previous 6 months. At 3 months, the treatment group showed significantly greater improvement than the controls on both gastroenterologists' and patients' ratings of diarrhea and abdominal pain, but constipation changed little. Good prognostic factors included overt psychiatric symptoms and intermittent pain exacerbated by stress, whereas those with constant abdominal pain were helped little by this treatment. This study has demonstrated that psychological treatment is feasible and effective in two thirds of those patients with irritable bowel syndrome who do not respond to standard medical treatment. ",0
"Clot-trapper device for transjugular thrombectomy from the inferior vena cava. The clot-trapper device for transjugular thrombectomy was used in 10 dogs with acute thrombosis and two dogs with chronic thrombosis. In eight of these animals, the clots were trapped with the clot-trapper device, then a mechanical thrombectomy device was used to destroy the clots. In 10 animals, including eight with in vitro thrombi and two with in situ thrombi, thrombi were efficiently trapped with the clot-trapper device. In two animals, pulmonary embolism occurred because of a discrepancy between the diameter of the inferior vena cava and the diameter of the bag opening. After increasing the size of the loop to match the diameter of the inferior vena cava, trapping of all thrombi was possible in both experiments (acute and chronic thrombosis). The clot-trapper device, in conjunction with an embolectomy balloon catheter and/or a mechanical thrombectomy device, facilitates the removal of thrombi from the inferior vena cava and iliac veins.

"Intrapericardial extralobar pulmonary sequestration in a neonate. A huge pericardial effusion was diagnosed during fetal ultrasound examination performed in the 42nd week of pregnancy on a healthy 25-year-old woman. Immediately after the birth, a two-dimensional echocardiogram confirmed this finding in the infant, and an intrapericardial kidney-shaped solid mass measuring 45 x 56 x 15 mm, completely surrounded by pericardial effusion, was visualized to the left part of the heart. The heart was normal. No signs of cardiac tamponade were seen. At the age of two days, the mass was surgically resected and the pericardial fluid evacuated. Microscopic examination revealed that the mass was formed totally of normal lung tissue surrounded by normal pleura. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of intrapericardial extralobar sequestration consisting of an accessory lung with completely normal lung tissue. ",0
"Comparison of four pulse oximeters: effects of venous occlusion and cold-induced peripheral vasoconstriction. The ability of four pulse oximeters (the Ohmeda 3700, Nellcor N100 and N200 and the Datex Oscar) to detect hypoxaemia was determined in the presence of venous obstruction and cold-induced peripheral vasoconstriction. Significant increases in detection time for hypoxaemia were found in both cases. There were no significant differences in detection time between the instruments, although the Ohmeda 3700 displayed smaller values of SaO2 under certain conditions. Peripheral vasoconstriction was induced using three differing methods which gave differing results, thus emphasizing the importance of methodology in assessments of pulse oximetry. ",0
"Early carcinoma of the gallbladder: macroscopic features and US findings. To facilitate early detection of carcinoma of the gallbladder, a comparative study of macroscopic forms and ultrasonographic (US) features of stage I (TNM staging system) gallbladder cancer was carried out retrospectively in 71 cases of such carcinomas that were resected surgically. Macroscopic forms of the lesions were classified into four types: pedunculated (eight cases), sessile (15 cases), superficial raised (25 cases), and flat (23 cases). Among 71 cases, only 20 were diagnosed preoperatively by means of US. US patterns of the lesions were also classified into four types: fungating mass, lumen filling, smooth raised, and thickening of mucosa. US features corresponded well to the macroscopic forms. No flat lesion was identified preoperatively. For early detection of carcinoma of the gallbladder, it seemed essential to pay careful attention to mild mucosal change, as more than 50% of early cancers did not show apparently protruding lesions.

"Intravenous immunoglobulin treatment in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. Clinical and laboratory characteristics associated with improvement. Of 52 patients fulfilling the criteria of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, 20 (38%) did not improve after intravenous immunoglobulin treatment, two (4%) had a short-lasting improvement and subsequent infusions had no effect, nine (17%) reached a spontaneously or therapeutically induced complete remission, and 21 patients (40%) needed intermittent infusions to maintain improvement. All patients who improved initially had symptoms that significantly interfered with life-style. After treatment, 90% of these patients were independent in their daily activities. Significantly associated with improvement were disease duration of less than 1 year, progression of weakness until treatment, absence of discrepancy in weakness between arms and legs, areflexia of the arms, and slowed nerve conduction velocity of the motor median nerve. The probability of improvement if all these features are present in 93%. ",0
"Magnetic resonance imaging in neurological disorders. To investigate the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in neurological disorders, 115 children were studied in two groups. Group A (78 patients) was studied by paired computed tomography and MRI cranial scans. Group B (37 patients) was studied by paired computed tomography assisted myelography (CTM) and MRI spinal scans. In group A, the scans were generally equivalent for supratentorial tumours and for investigating fits, hydrocephalus, benign intracranial hypertension, and cerebral atrophies, but MRI scanning was superior for posterior fossa tumours and cysts. In group B, MRI scans were superior for intramedullary spinal tumours, spinal dysraphic problems with tethering or syrinx, and were complementary to CTM in diastematomyelia. ",0
"Dysplasia and DNA aneuploidy in a pelvic pouch. Report of a case. A patient with an 18-year history of ulcerative colitis was operated on with colectomy, mucosal proctectomy, ileoanal anastomosis, and an S-type pelvic pouch due to intractable chronic continuous disease. The patient was followed by endoscopic controls and biopsy sampling from the pouch at regular intervals. A gradual development of severe atrophy in the ileal mucosa was followed by the development of low grade dysplasia. At the most recent endoscopic control, 4 years after the construction of the pouch, biopsies were sampled also for flow cytometric DNA analyses. DNA aneuploidy was detected in a biopsy from the center of the pouch, and a biopsy taken immediately adjacent showed low grade dysplasia. These findings underline the importance of endoscopic follow-up after construction of a pelvic pouch and focus attention to the potential of malignant transformation of the mucosa. ",0
"Successful treatment of recurrent corneal erosion with Nd:YAG anterior stromal puncture I used a new technique to create anterior corneal stromal punctures for the treatment of traumatic recurrent corneal erosions that had not responded to conventional therapy. Three patients with such erosions within the visual axis were successfully treated by using multiple applications of the Nd: YAG laser set at energy levels between 1.8 and 2.2 mJ. One of these patients had previous stromal puncture with a bent 25-gauge needle. The erosions of all patients healed without complications and have remained symptom-free for four to six months. Compared with needle puncture, the laser punctures were more reproducible, shallow, and translucent. ",0
"DNA analysis of multiple synchronous renal cell carcinomas. The authors used retrospective quantitative DNA analysis to study interrelationships between multiple synchronous renal cell carcinomas in seven patients. DNA content was determined by image analysis on Feulgen-stained nuclear smears prepared from multiple paraffin blocks from each tumor. Tumors were unilateral in four cases and bilateral in three. Ten tumors had homogeneous, and four heterogeneous DNA stemlines. Intertumoral heterogeneity in four cases suggested multifocal origin. Identical DNA aneuploid indices in bilateral tumors in one case suggested metastasis from a solitary origin. Abnormal DNA content and heterogeneous populations began to appear in the size range 2.0 to 5.0 cm. All tumors over 5.0 cm contained nondiploid populations. Although the interrelationships between these multiple synchronous neoplasms are not entirely clear, the DNA analysis suggests that the occurrence of nondiploid stemlines and heterogeneous DNA content may parallel both tumor growth and more aggressive behavior.

"Macroscopic hematuria and proteinuria preceding renal IgA deposition in patients with IgA nephropathy. Although the clinical onset of IgA nephropathy is frequently impossible to define, macroscopic hematuria apparently heralds the onset of the disease in some patients. We describe the clinical course and renal histologic findings of four adults with IgA nephropathy who were diagnosed by the characteristic immunohistologic features in a second renal biopsy specimen. IgA was not detected in the initial renal biopsy specimens obtained 9 months to 4 years earlier. The first renal biopsy had been performed to evaluate macroscopic hematuria (recurrent in three patients), accompanied by pathologic proteinuria in two patients. Our observations suggest that the pathognomonic immunohistologic findings of IgA nephropathy may follow the clinical onset and raise questions about the presumed pathogenetic role of IgA in the early stages of this disease.

"Alanine aminotransferase in clinical practice. A review. Alanine aminotransferase is an enzyme produced mainly in the liver. When serum activity is measured, it provides a marker of hepatic disease. This review explores the biochemistry and laboratory analysis of alanine aminotransferase in terms of its significance in human health and disease. Cut-off levels that define abnormality are rather arbitrary and this decreases the specificity of the test in apparently healthy patients. A small, but important, group of patients with alanine aminotransferase abnormality have underlying liver disease that may be treatable. Most can be diagnosed based on history, physical examination, and biochemical-serological profiles. Liver biopsy can complement the diagnostic process in selected circumstances. Literature pertaining to this is critically reviewed. ",0
"Botulinum treatment of childhood strabismus. Four hundred thirteen children ranging in age from 2 months to 12 years were treated for strabismus by botulinum injection of extraocular muscles. An average of 1.7 injections per patient was given. Follow-up at an average of 26 months after the last injection (minimum, 6 months) was available on 362 children (88%). The frequency of correction of 10 prism diopters (PD) or less in various groups of strabismus cases was: all 362 cases, 61%; all esotropia, 66%; infantile esotropia, 65%; and exotropia, 45%. Smaller deviations (10-20 PD) were more frequently corrected (73%) than were larger deviations (20-110 PD, 54%). The frequency of correction to 10 PD or less of previously operated cases was not different from that of unoperated cases. There was no globe perforation, amblyopia, or visual loss produced by the injection treatment in this series. ",0
"Factors associated with soft- and hard-tissue compromise of endosseous implants. This prospective analysis identifies factors associated with endosseous implant removal as well as factors associated with implant morbidity resulting in nonscheduled patient visits. Treatment of the latter conditions is discussed. The most important factors identified for implant success were surgery without compromise in technique, placing implants into sound bone, avoiding thin bone or implant dehiscence at the time of implant placement, avoiding premature implant exposure during the healing period, establishing a balanced restoration, and insuring appropriate follow-up hygiene care. In the posterior mandible, the presence of keratinized gingiva was strongly correlated with optimal soft- and hard-tissue health. ",0
"Bilateral phrenic nerve palsy associated with open-heart surgery. The incidence of phrenic nerve palsy after open-heart surgery has been estimated at 10%, but it is usually unilateral and does not cause symptoms. Bilateral phrenic nerve injury after coronary artery bypass surgery is a rare complication. This case report describes a patient who developed bilateral phrenic nerve palsies and required prolonged ventilatory support. Denervation of both hemidiaphragms was documented by needle electromyography four weeks after bypass surgery. The patient required total ventilatory support for three months and partial ventilatory support for an additional three months. This case demonstrates the usefulness of electromyographic screening for documentation and prognostication after phrenic nerve injury. The cause of the lesion was unclear, but hypothermia and stretch were leading hypotheses. This patient developed the phrenic nerve palsies despite using a cardiac insulation pad. ",0
"Rupture of atheromatous plaque as a cause of thrombotic occlusion of stenotic internal carotid artery. We analyzed the clinical profiles and autopsy findings of five patients who died shortly after developing cerebral infarction following thrombotic occlusion of the internal carotid artery. In all five cases, thrombotic occlusion was caused by rupture of the fibrous lining over the gruel of atheroma at the origin of the internal carotid artery showing tight stenosis of the lumen. The mean +/- SD shorter diameter of the lumen at the site of occlusion was 1.5 +/- 0.4 mm. Our results show that an internal carotid artery with tight stenosis of the lumen by atheroma containing gruel harbors a risk of thrombotic occlusion, which may give rise to cerebral infarction by artery-to-artery embolism or by reduced cerebral perfusion.

"Untying the gordian knot: the genetics of Tourette syndrome. A review of the current status of the genetics of Tourette syndrome is presented. Over the course of the 104 years since Gilles de la Tourette described the syndrome that bears his name, a body of carefully collected, described, and analyzed data has produced a model of the genetics that implicates a single dominant gene that is variably penetrant in males and females. Moreover, the locus of action of this gene is most likely in the dopaminergic system of the midbrain. A systematic search for this gene using recombinant DNA techniques is under way. ",0
"Prophylaxis of deep venous thrombosis after acute abdominal operation. Two hundred and forty-five patients who underwent acute extensive abdominal operations were randomized into three regimens to achieve optimal prophylaxis of postoperative thromboembolic complications. All of the patients were screened by the 125I-fibrinogen uptake test for seven days and if the phlebographic findings were positive. Of 81 patients receiving low dose heparin, 12 had thromboembolism. Of 79 receiving a combination of low dose heparin and graded compression stockings, two had thromboembolism, and of 85 receiving a combination of dextran and graded compression stockings, 13 had this complication. This difference is significant in favor of the second treatment (p = 0.013). It is concluded that the combination of low dose heparin and graded compression stockings is an effective way to prevent thromboembolism after acute abdominal operations. ",0
"Cytomegalovirus colitis and wasting. Disseminated cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is associated with significant and progressive depletion of body cell mass and body fat in patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). In a study examining the effect of ganciclovir on wasting in AIDS patients with disseminated CMV infection, it was found that patients receiving ganciclovir had significant improvement in such variables as body cell mass, body fat, body weight, and total body energy content when compared with those not receiving ganciclovir. The repletion of body cell mass observed in AIDS patients with disseminated CMV infection who are successfully treated with ganciclovir appears to be associated with improved quality of life and prolongation of survival.

"Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma of the tongue. A case of posterior tongue lymphoma associated with adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) that occurred as a lesion in the lingual dorsal portion is reported in a 64-year-old woman. Initially, a diagnosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma was considered as no findings associated with ATL except lymphadenopathy and serum anti-ATLA antibodies were present. Combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy were administered with favorable results; however, 4 months later, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia developed, and 2 months later, generalized lymphadenopathy and hypercalcemia evolved. At this time, a diagnosis of ATL was made. The patient died of renal dysfunction 6 months after the initial presentation. In suspected cases of ATL and malignant diseases of T-cell lineage, namely, malignant lymphoma and mycosis fungoides, the presence of HTLV-1 infection should be confirmed by testing for anti-ATLA antibodies.

"Long-term outcome of massive small bowel resection. The long-term outcome for seven patients 4-17 yr (mean 7.1 yr) after massive small bowel resection, leaving 5-160 cm (mean 86.4) of small bowel, was reviewed. Their mean age at the final enterectomy was 40 yr. Adaptation to foodstuffs and the effects of physiologic alterations and complicating diseases on their return to work were emphasized. More than 3.5 yr after surgery, the patients had adapted to many kinds of foodstuffs, but dietary fat could not be tolerated by three patients. Six patients returned to work an average of 2.7 yr after surgery, but four were obliged to discontinue their work because of rehospitalization for long-term complications. In addition, their working hours were limited, and they could not engage in heavy physical work, owing to physiologic alterations, such as a reduced metabolic state, after massive enterectomy. ",0
"Long-term medical consequences of incest, rape, and molestation. One hundred thirty-one patients who gave a history of childhood sexual abuse were seen in a general medical practice decades after the event and were compared with a control group. The subject patients were found to be distinct for chronic depression, morbid obesity, marital instability, high utilization of medical care, and certain psychosomatic symptoms, particularly chronic gastrointestinal distress and recurrent headaches. It is clear that these remote events can underlie difficult chronic medical problems. Questions about childhood sexual abuse must become part of the practitioner's review of systems in these difficult cases, if not routinely. ",0
"Estimation of PR and ER by immunocytochemistry in breast cancer. Comparison with radioligand binding methods. Immunocytochemical assays for progesterone receptor (PR) using monoclonal antirabbit PR antibodies (PR-ICA) and for estrogen receptor (ER) (ER-ICA) were compared with radioligand binding (dextran-coated charcoal [DCC]) methods for receptor determination in patients with breast cancer. Immunocytochemical staining for PR was exclusively nuclear in localization. In this regard, PR staining is similar to previous findings for ER; PR-ICA showed a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 100%. ER-ICA was also 89% sensitive and similarly specific. There was good correlation between the degree and intensity of staining and quantitative binding of radioligand. Receptor-positive tumors, however, show considerable variation of immunocytochemical staining, suggesting heterogeneity of cellular PR content. The availability of an immunocytochemical assay for PR increases the discriminatory potential for these methods of receptor determination. ",0
"LDH isoenzymes in cerebrospinal fluid in various brain tumours. This study examined the isoenzymatic pattern of LDH in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as well as the ratio between the five fractions of LDH among patients with various brain tumours, carcinomatous meningitis and control groups. LDH 1/LDH 2 less than 1 was found significant for carcinomatous meningitis (p less than 0.001) and brain metastases (p less than 0.001). LDH 1/LDH 2 ratio was found to be significantly lower in carcinomatous meningitis than in brain metastases (p less than 0.05). No LDH 1/LDH 2 ratios smaller than 1 were found in the other groups. The LDH 1/LDH 2 ratio smaller than 1 was found in the early stage of carcinomatous meningitis without other evidences of the involvement of the leptomeninges. Examination of LDH 1/LDH 2 can be found as an adjunctive method to identify brain metastases and carcinomatous meningitis at the initial stage. ",0
Analgesic use: a study of treatments used by patients for migraine prior to attending the City of London Migraine Clinic. Eighty-three unselected patients attending the City of London Migraine Clinic for the first time were asked about their drug intake and use of alternative treatment. Thirty-one of those questioned took regular daily doses of medication. Fifteen were taking a combination of drugs bought 'over the counter' (OTC) and drugs prescribed by their GP; eleven took OTC drugs only; and 5 took prescription drugs only. It was noticeable that those taking drugs prescribed both by the GP and obtainable over the counter were more likely than the other groups to be taking several drugs rather than a single type. Thirty five of the 83 (42.2%) had tried alternative treatments for their attacks. ,0
"Biological correlates of mental activity studied with PET. The development of newer imaging techniques that allow direct investigation of the function of the human brain under normal and pathological conditions has affected the way in which we conceive of the mind/brain relation. In this report the authors use examples from findings obtained with positron emission tomography (PET) to illustrate the highly interactive organization of the brain. Because operations in the brain require the participation of various brain areas, a model that does not require a one-to-one relationship between the physical and mental, but rather allows an association between clusters of physical processes and one or more mental phenomena, may reflect better the relation between physical brain phenomena and mental activities.

"A model of pneumococcal pneumonia in chronically intoxicated rats. To determine the role of chronic ethanol intoxication on the pathogenesis of pneumococcal pneumonia, male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed an ethanol-containing diet for 1 week before intratracheal challenge with type 3 Streptococcus pneumoniae and for 10 days after infection. Control rats were fed the same diet except that ethanol was replaced isocalorically with carbohydrate. Ethanol treatment increased pneumococcal bacteremia, levels of capsular polysaccharide antigenemia, and susceptibility to lethal pneumonia. Once dissemination occurred, ethanol-fed rats failed to eliminate pneumococci from the bloodstream. Ethanol-fed rats demonstrated a defect in late pulmonary clearance of pneumococci that was temporally associated with a significantly higher pneumonia severity index. Pneumonia was characterized by an intense polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration, severe edema, and a fibrous exudate. Bronchoalveolar lavage confirmed the heightened inflammatory response in the lungs of ethanol-fed rats, suggesting that chronic ethanol intoxication did not impair polymorphonuclear leukocyte recruitment but may alter their antipneumococcal functions.

"Combined hepatic and vena caval resection with autogenous caval graft replacement. Right-sided and caudate hepatic lobectomy with resection of the retrohepatic vena cava were performed in a 34-year-old woman with recurrent adrenal carcinoma. The vena cava was replaced with a graft constructed from autogenous superficial femoral vein. Included herein is a review of the literature detailing the three previously reported cases of combined hepatic and caval resection; to our knowledge, there are no prior reports of the use of an autogenous vein graft in this setting. With surgical and anesthetic techniques, including total vascular exclusion of the liver and venovenous bypass, methods that were developed in large part through experience in liver transplantation, this type of surgery can be performed with a high rate of success.

"Effects of radiation therapy on skeletal growth in childhood. Ionizing radiation was used to treat childhood cancer long before the advent of chemotherapy, and it took little time for physicians to appreciate the deleterious effects it had on skeletal growth. The cause of this complication results predominantly from alteration of chondroblastic activity. This may stem directly from irradiation at the epiphyseal plate or indirectly from irradiation of glands that secrete growth-mediating hormones. The complication can go far beyond the obvious physical afflictions and extend into the psychologic domain, rendering deeper, more permanent scars. Presently, many of these effects are predictable, reducible, and treatable without compromising the cure that so often depends on the use of irradiation. Because of the complexities of childhood cancer therapy, strategies aimed at diminishing these effects are challenging. It is imperative that these effects be understood so that they can be reduced in current patients and prevented in future patients. ",0
"Clinical spectrum of leber's congenital amaurosis in the second to fourth decades of life. Leber's congenital amaurosis is a type of congenital retinitis pigmentosa in which the fundus abnormalities are extremely variable and to some extent age dependent. Most cases are seen in infancy. The retinal, electroretinogram, and fluorescein angiographic findings are described in ten patients with Leber's congenital amaurosis who ranged in age from 13 to 36 years when first seen. All of the patients were from Honduras and were unrelated except for one pair (a brother and sister). The polymorphic appearance of the fundus is emphasized and is particularly striking in the siblings. A macular lesion (a bull's-eye maculopathy) not previously associated with Leber's congenital amaurosis is reported as a variant fundus appearance in this entity. ",0
"Quadriceps myopathy: forme fruste of Becker muscular dystrophy. We examined dystrophin, the protein product of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene, in muscle biopsy specimens from 4 male patients with quadriceps myopathy, all of whom showed a mild and slowly progressive myopathy confined to the quadriceps muscles. All 4 patients had clear abnormalities of dystrophin, and were diagnosed as having Becker muscular dystrophy by both immunofluorescence and immunoblot examinations; that is, dystrophin of an abnormal molecular mass was visualized in muscle cryosections as ""patchy"" or discontinuous immunostaining at the surface membrane of the muscle fibers. One patient had a brother who showed widespread myopathic changes consistent with typical Becker muscular dystrophy. We conclude that the syndrome called quadriceps myopathy includes a group of forme fruste Becker muscular dystrophy. ",0
"Response of spinal cord blood flow and motor and sensory evoked potentials to aortic ligation. To produce spinal cord ischemia in the lamb, ligation of the thoracic aorta was performed for 15, 30, and 45 minutes in three animals each. Spinal cord blood flow and motor and sensory evoked potentials were measured before, during, and after aortic ligation. Ischemia with a blood flow of zero during ligation was encountered in the thoracic and lumbar cords, followed by hyperemia upon release of the ligature. Both somatosensory and motor evoked potentials were obliterated during aortic ligation and gradually recovered following resumption of flow. Motor and sensory evoked potentials behaved similarly to high aortic ligation. ",0
"Prediagnostic serum levels of carotenoids and vitamin E as related to subsequent cancer in Washington County, Maryland. In 1974 and 1975, serum specimens were collected from 25,802 volunteers in Washington County, Maryland. The serum was kept frozen at -73 degrees C until the time of assay. Prediagnostic samples from 436 cancer cases and 765 matched control subjects have been assayed. Nine sites have been studied: colon, rectum, pancreas, lung, melanoma, basal cell of skin, breast, prostate, and bladder. Serum beta-carotene levels showed a strong protective association with lung cancer, suggestive protective associations with melanoma and bladder cancer, and a suggestive but nonprotective association with rectal cancer. Serum vitamin E levels had a protective association with lung cancer; none of the other sites showed impressive associations. Low levels of serum lycopene were strongly associated with pancreatic cancer and less strongly associated with cancer of the bladder and rectum. ",0
"Recovery from vegetative state of six months' duration associated with Sinemet (levodopa/carbidopa). Certain pharmacologic interventions may improve outcome for brain injury in animals and humans. Medications affecting the dopaminergic pathway appear to be important. We present the case of a 24-year-old man with traumatic brain injury who remained unresponsive to commands and unchanged for six months despite periodic aggressive therapy. Within days of beginning Sinemet (levodopa/carbidopa), the patient became conversant and responsive. The reported low likelihood of spontaneous recovery of cognition in patients who are vegetative for six months suggests that Sinemet was responsible for this patient's recovery. In this case, the relatively small risk of side effects from Sinemet was greatly outweighed by the change in functional outcome. ",0
"Treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum with cyclosporine: results in seven patients. The mainstay of therapy for pyoderma gangrenosum has been corticosteroids, but many patients respond poorly. During the past 2 years we have treated seven patients who had pyoderma gangrenosum with cyclosporine after their condition proved resistant to conventional therapy. No evidence of permanent toxicity from cyclosporine was detected and treatment with other immunosuppressive agents was discontinued in five of seven cases. Tuberculosis was reactivated in one patient. Three patients had a remission, three had an intermediate response, and one did not respond. These results indicate that cyclosporine is useful in the treatment of patients with refractory pyoderma gangrenosum and suggest an immune mechanism in the pathogenesis of this disorder. ",0
"Randomised single blind trial to compare the toxicity of subconjunctival gentamicin and cefuroxime in cataract surgery. Comparatively little attention has been paid to the conjunctival toxicity of antibiotics administered at the time of cataract surgery. We have observed the effect of subconjunctival gentamicin and cefuroxime injection, using colour photography in a randomised single blind trial of 121 patients undergoing routine cataract surgery. Our results suggest that a hyperaemic eye is likely to occur about twice as often in patients injected with gentamicin (p less than 0.001). Gentamicin is associated with more pain postoperatively (p less than 0.05). Significant manifestations of gentamicin toxicity are conjunctival oedema and capillary closure. Cefuroxime has some theoretical advantages over gentamicin in its antibacterial spectrum. ",0
"Neuropsychological aspects of learning disabilities in epilepsy. Cognitive impairment is regarded as the link between epileptic conditions and the inability to learn in school. The neuropsychological approach to learning disabilities in epilepsy, therefore, first concentrates on analyzing the differential effects of epileptic factors on cognitive function. The impact of seizure activity, localization of epileptogenic foci, and antiepileptic treatment on cognitive functioning can be evaluated based upon the results of continuous assessment with a computerized neuropsychological test system. Second, learning disabilities may be evaluated on observations made during classroom performance. Three issues seem to predominate in learning studies among disabled children with epilepsy: test-retest variability, deterioration, and the supposed specificity of the learning disabilities. ",0
"Longitudinal histopathologic assessment of rejection after bladder-drained canine pancreas allograft transplantation. In preparation for assessment of percutaneous biopsies in our clinical pancreas transplant program, a working knowledge of the histopathologic changes after transplantation was obtained in a longitudinal open biopsy study of 16 dogs receiving bladder-drained whole pancreas allografts. Edema, extravasation of polymorphs, and lymphocytes associated with focal parenchymal injury were early, invariable, and probably nonspecific findings. The initial feature of unmodified rejection was the appearance of capillary and small vein endothelial changes with mainly perivascular inflammatory cell infiltration. Acinar cell loss occurred early and was progressive, whereas islets and ducts were relatively preserved, indicating that acinar tissue may be more vulnerable to lytic necrosis when damaged. Functional rejection, determined by fasting urinary amylase levels, was at a stage of extensive and irreversible necrosis. Functioning grafts in immunosuppressed dogs had minor and transient endothelial changes with absence of class II antigen staining of parenchymal cells. ",0
"Postoperative pancreatic abscess due to Plesiomonas shigelloides. Plesiomonas shigelloides is being recognized with increasing frequency as a human pathogen. The organism is ubiquitous in fresh and brackish water, and clinical illness has been associated with foreign travel and ingestion of inadequately cooked seafood. We describe a 64-year-old Filipino woman who presented 2 weeks after elective cholecystectomy and pancreatic biopsy with left upper quadrant pain, abdominal distention, and fever. Computerized tomography of the abdomen revealed an abscess in the tail of the pancreas with fluid accumulation in the lesser omental sac. Percutaneous aspiration yielded purulent material, and P. shigelloides was recovered in pure culture. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of pancreatic abscess due to P. shigelloides.

"Uniparental paternal disomy in Angelman's syndrome. Angelman's syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome are both causes of mental retardation with recognisable, but quite different, clinical phenotypes. Both are associated with deletions of chromosome 15q11-13, of maternal origin in Angelman's and paternal in Prader-Willi. Prader-Willi can arise by inheritance of two chromosomes 15 from the mother and none from the father (uniparental maternal disomy). In 2 patients with Angelman's syndrome we found evidence of uniparental paternal disomy. The phenotypic effects of maternal and paternal disomy of chromosome 15 are very different and inheritance of two normal 15s from one parent does not lead to normal development--strong evidence in man for genomic imprinting, in which the same gene has different effects dependent upon its parental origin.

"Pleuropulmonary manifestations of hepatic amebiasis Pleuropulmonary manifestations of hepatic amebiasis occurred in 30 patients; 18 (60%) presented with at least 1 pulmonary complaint and 10 (33%) had multiple pulmonary symptoms. In 14 patients (47%), abnormalities were found on examination of the chest. In 16 chest roentgenograms (53%), there was at least 1 abnormality: right-sided pleural effusion (9 patients) and elevated right hemidiaphragm (8 patients) were the most common. All patients were treated with metronidazole (Flagyl) and had resolution of the amebic liver abscess and pulmonary disease. Pleuropulmonary disease is a common complication of amebic liver abscess. The clinical presentation and chest roentgenograms are virtually diagnostic and obviate the need for invasive procedures to confirm the diagnosis. Pleuropulmonary disease resolves with amebicidal treatment of the hepatic abscess. ",0
"Acute tumor lysis syndrome after intrathecal methotrexate administration. A 44-year-old man had acute tumor lysis syndrome after a single dose of intrathecal methotrexate was administered for lymphomatous meningitis (high-grade, small noncleaved B-cell) in the setting of untreated systemic disease. The metabolic derangements reversed completely with conservative therapy and did not recur with subsequent treatment. Intrathecal methotrexate administration results in potentially toxic systemic methotrexate levels which persist longer than an equivalent systemic dose. Active central nervous system lymphoma may increase the duration of toxic levels in the circulation and contribute to the peripheral effects of the drug. The pathogenesis of tumor lysis syndrome in this patient and the mechanisms of systemic toxicity of intrathecal methotrexate are discussed. ",0
"Intradural spinal cord tumor presenting as a subarachnoid hemorrhage: magnetic resonance imaging diagnosis. Negative findings on four-vessel angiography after a subarachnoid hemorrhage are seen in 5 to 30% of patients. A previously silent lesion in the spinal canal may be responsible for the ictus in a small percentage of this group. The etiological factors include tumors and arteriovenous malformations; however, investigations of such lesions have been limited to patients with signs and symptoms of spinal cord or nerve root pathological processes. This report describes the management of a 56-year-old woman with clinical findings typical of an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and negative findings on cerebral angiography, in whom magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement revealed an intradural extramedullary cervical schwannoma. For this reason, cervicothoracic magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement should be considered as an adjunctive scanning examination in all patients with a subarachnoid hemorrhage and negative findings on angiography.

Transferrin receptor activity as a marker in transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. An immunohistochemical staining method was used to study transferrin receptors (TFR) in bladder tissue from 10 patients with benign conditions and 33 with bladder cancer. All patients with bladder cancer were followed up by cystoscopy at intervals of 3 months (mean follow-up period 11 months). The relationship between TFR activity and recurrence rates was investigated. It was not possible to demonstrate TFR in normal bladder mucosa except for the proliferating cells of the basal layer. TFR activity in malignant tissue correlated well with the histological grade and pathological stage of the tumour. Patients with low grade superficial tumours showing TFR activity had a higher recurrence rate than those with no TFR activity. It was concluded that TFR activity in low grade superficial bladder tumours is a useful marker for predicting the recurrence rate. ,0
"The significance of moderate and severe inflammation on class I Papanicolaou smear The significance of a cytologic diagnosis of moderate and severe inflammation with a normal (class I) Papanicolaou smear has not been addressed. A retrospective review of 596 consecutive cervical smears performed over 13 months revealed 85 women who had a class I cytologic smear with moderate to severe inflammation. Seventy-eight patients had colposcopic examinations and were considered for this study. Fifty-nine (75.6%) had cervical punch biopsies and/or endocervical biopsies. Of the 78, 19 (24.4%) had cervical condylomata and nine (11.5%) had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. We conclude that class I cytologic smears with moderate to severe inflammation may be associated with findings of condylomata and cervical dysplasia. ",0
"Infrarenal abdominal aortic disease: a review of the retroperitoneal approach. Transabdominal exposure is the most widely used surgical approach to the infrarenal aorta. Over the last 30 years a number of surgeons have championed the retroperitoneal approach for repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms and aortoiliac occlusive disease using a variety of incisions. Several studies attest to the clinical superiority of this approach over the transabdominal route and recent evidence demonstrates reduced physiological disturbance with this technique. The retroperitoneal approach is suitable for all elective operations on the abdominal aorta, particularly in patients with high-risk aneurysms and in selected patients with symptomatic and ruptured aneurysms.

"Urogenital dysfunction after abdominoperineal resection for carcinoma of the rectum. The long-term urogenital dysfunctions in 46 of 104 surviving patients submitted to abdominoperineal resection for rectal carcinoma between 1972 and 1986 were collected and assessed. Urinary retention was present in 41 percent of the men and 35 percent of women, while incontinence was present in 10 percent of men and 29 percent of women. Impotence was reported by 59 percent of the males, all sexually active before surgery. Dyspareunia was present in 50 percent of the women in the study. The possibility of treating prostatic hypertrophy concurrently with abdominoperineal resection in selected cases to avoid urinary retention is discussed. The limited number of responders to the survey may interfere with the global statistical significance. ",0
"Antibodies to nuclear lamin C in chronic hepatitis delta virus infection. Sera of patients with chronic hepatitis delta virus infection stained the nuclear periphery in indirect immunofluorescence. Using proteins of isolated nuclei, isolated nuclear matrices, the nuclear pore complex-lamina fraction and purified lamins A and C as antigen source in immunoblotting experiments, nuclear lamin C was identified as the reactive antigen. Most sera tested (8 of 10) recognized nuclear lamin C exclusively, but not the nuclear lamins A and B. Antibodies reacting with both nuclear lamins A and C, which share extensive sequence homologies, have been reported to occur in autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis. The present findings suggest that the novel autoantibody associated with chronic hepatitis delta virus infection recognizes an epitope localized in the short carboxyterminal region of nuclear lamin C.

"Middle cerebral artery flow velocity waveforms in fetal hypoxaemia. In 81 small-for-gestational age fetuses (SGA) colour flow imaging was used to identify the fetal middle cerebral artery for subsequent pulsed Doppler studies. Impedence to flow (pulsatility index; PI) was significantly lower, and mean blood velocity was significantly higher, than the respective reference ranges with gestation. Fetal blood sampling by cordocentesis was performed in all SGA fetuses and a significant quadratic relation was found between fetal hypoxaemia and the degree of reduction in the PI of FVWs from the fetal middle cerebral artery. Thus, maximum reduction in PI is reached when the fetal PO2 is 2-4 SD below the normal mean for gestation. When the oxygen deficit is greater there is a tendency for the PI to rise, and this presumably reflects the development of brain oedema. ",0
"The acutely affected abdomen in paraplegic spinal cord injury patients. The records of 145 paraplegic or quadriplegic patients were reviewed to identify those factors useful in the correct diagnosis of the acute abdomen in this population. Twenty-one patients had 22 episodes of acute or subacute abdominal problems. Presenting complaints, physical findings, and laboratory results were useful in various ways. However appropriate radiographic studies led to the correct diagnosis in 77% of patients. Although paraplegic and quadriplegic patients are predisposed to a distinct constellation of medical problems, including urinary tract infection and calculi, they also may present with other abdominal conditions that cause significant morbidity and mortality if not promptly recognized.

"Clinical recognition and evaluation of peptic ulcer disease. When a patient has epigastric pain that worsens 1 to 3 hours after meals, the possibility of peptic ulcer disease should be considered. Completely typical clinical presentations in patients younger than age 50 justify empirical therapy when no physical or laboratory findings suggest a mimicking disorder. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy should be undertaken when response to therapy is incomplete, symptoms recur quickly, or dyspeptic symptoms present for the first time in a patient older than age 50. When gastric ulcers are diagnosed radiographically, endoscopy and biopsy at multiple sites should be done to exclude malignant disease. Intractable duodenal ulcers may necessitate endoscopic biopsy of antral and duodenal mucosa to rule out an associated Helicobacter pylori infection, which may modify therapeutic approaches. Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is rare but should be suspected when ulcer disease presents atypically or aggressively or in families. Diagnosis is not difficult to confirm. ",0
"Persistent mullerian duct syndrome. Persistent mullerian syndrome is rare. A case of phenotypically normal male with persistent mullerian structures that consisted of a bicornuate uterus, fallopian tubes, and upper third of the vagina is reported. These unusual structures were found in association with bilateral cryptorchidism and a right inguinal hernia, and were diagnosed while repairing the hernia in the neonatal period. The uterus and fallopian tubes were removed via laparotomy when the child was eighteen months old; at the same time a bilateral orchiopexy was performed. To avoid damage to the vas deferens, which lay in closely to the mullerian structures and could not be separated from the vaginal wall, a small segment of the upper third of the vagina was retained. The testicles, although normal on pathologic examination, have shown poor response to hormonal stimulation with human chorionic gonadotropin. Long-term follow-up for these patients is necessary because they have an increased risk of testicular tumors developing. ",0
"Introducing the 'walk-up' flap. Reconstructive oral and maxillofacial surgeons often find the need for additional soft tissue even when a myocutaneous flap has been previously placed. This article introduces the principles, technique, and results of 32 ""walk-up"" muscle flaps derived from existing myocutaneous flaps. The anastomotic vascular ingrowth at the original myocutaneous flap's distal end permits its proximal detachment and axial vessel ligation to rotate the proximal two thirds to a tissue-deficient site. In our experience at the University of Miami, these flaps have been predictable (97% viable transfer rate), have provided vascular soft tissue in deficient areas, and have been skin grafted at their surface to increase oral lining or skin cover, among several other uses.

"Sudden death due to delayed rupture of hepatic subcapsular hematoma following blunt abdominal trauma. Blunt abdominal trauma can cause sudden, unexpected death due to injuries to internal organs. Rupture of a hepatic subcapsular hematoma is a relatively rare cause of sudden death following minor blunt abdominal trauma. Death may be delayed several days to weeks. The autopsy is an invaluable diagnostic tool that can be utilized to uncover sudden deaths due to abdominal trauma. The case of an alcoholic who died of a ruptured hepatic subcapsular hematoma is presented. The death investigation revealed that the victim had sustained blunt abdominal trauma during a fall a few days prior to death. ",0
"Long-term potentiation of electrotonic coupling at mixed synapses. Long-term potentiation of chemical synapses is closely related to memory and learning. Studies of this process have concentrated on chemically mediated excitatory synapses. By contrast, activity-dependent modification of gap junctions, which also widely exist in higher structures such as hippocampus and neocortex, has not been described. Here we report that at mixed synapses between sensory afferents and an identified reticulospinal neuron, the electrotonic coupling potential can be potentiated, as well as the chemically mediated excitatory postsynaptic potential, for a prolonged time period using a stimulation paradigm like that which produces long-term potentiation in hippocampus. The effect on coupling is due to an increase in gap-junctional conductance. Our data indicate that the potentiation of both synaptic components requires an increase in intracellular calcium, involves activation of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors, and is specific to the tetanized pathway.

"Limb-salvage surgery in the treatment of osteosarcoma in skeletally immature individuals. Sacrifice of major growth plates during resection and fixed-length reconstruction of a limb in a skeletally immature child with osteosarcoma may result in a significant limb-length inequality as growth progresses. A limb-length discrepancy in the humerus may cause minor cosmetic problems but does not generally result in a significant functional deficit. In the lower extremity, tumors about the knee, including the distal femur and proximal tibia, usually present the dilemma of whether limb salvage by arthrodesis, osteoarticular allograft, or endoprosthetic replacement would result in a significant limb-length inequality and whether amputation of the extremity is a preferable procedure. The techniques of rotationplasty and an expandable endoprosthesis have been successfully used for treating skeletally immature patients with osteosarcoma of the distal femur. With regard to survival and function, the results obtained with these innovative methods are favorable compared with those of a high above-knee amputation. ",0
"The management of postoperative chylous ascites. A case report and literature review. Chylous ascites remains rare as a complication of surgical intervention. Although therapeutic manoeuvres to control chylous ascites have been developed over the past 20 years, its pathophysiology is poorly understood. Conservative approaches involving dietary restriction of long-chain triglycerides and salt, together with multiple paracenteses, are still the therapies of choice. Persistent chylous ascites may be treated surgically by ligation of leaking lymphatics or implantation of a peritoneovenous shunt once the lymphatic anatomy has been defined by preoperative investigations. We report a case of chylous ascites developing after laparotomy and duodenotomy for obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, which did not respond adequately to medical therapy and was successfully managed by the insertion of a peritoneovenous shunt.

"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease--more than a renal disease. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common genetic disease, affecting a half million Americans. The clinical phenotype can result from at least two different gene defects. One gene that can cause ADPKD has been located on the short arm of chromosome 16. This discovery has made possible new methods for diagnosing the disorder in gene carriers prior to the development of renal cysts. Although renal cysts are clearly an important manifestation of the gene defect, other systemic manifestations are both common and clinically important. Cardiac valvular lesions, intracranial aneurysms, hepatic cysts, and diverticula are included in the array of systemic manifestations. Moreover, renal cysts are only one of a myriad of renal manifestations. Although ADPKD was long considered an adult cystic disease, it is also a common cause of childhood cystic disease and must be considered in the differential diagnosis in that setting. ",0
"Endoscopic nasobiliary catheter drainage in biliary and pancreatic disease. Nasobiliary catheter drainage was first introduced a decade ago. It provides drainage of the biliary system and facilitates interventional procedures of the biliary and pancreatic system, both for therapy and research purposes. The present review addresses the designs of nasobiliary catheters, the technique of insertion, and indications for drainage, with special emphasis on the management of bile duct stones and associated complications. Its potential application in biliary research is discussed further. Certain caveats in the performance of nasobiliary drainage are also included. All of these emphasize the need for this technique to be included in therapeutic endoscopy training. ",0
"Speech, velopharyngeal function, and hearing before and after orthognathic surgery. Articulation, voice, resonance, hearing sensitivity, and middle ear function were examined in 34 patients before and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after orthognathic surgery. Thirty of the 34 patients had articulation errors before surgery. Errors on the sibilants /s/ and /z/ occurred most frequently, followed by those on /j,zh,ch/ and /sh/. Errors were predominantly distortions with both visual and acoustic components. After surgery, articulation improved spontaneously in the absence of intervention. Most of the preoperative articulation errors were eliminated by 3 months postoperative, but, thereafter, a gradual decline was noted so that by 12 months, errors occurred on /s/ and /z/. Voice, resonance, velopharyngeal port area, and hearing sensitivity were not altered by surgery. This study suggests that severe skeletal malocclusions requiring surgical correction have deleterious effects on the patients' articulation of consonants and that surgical alteration leads to the correction of most of these errors.

"Osteoid osteoma of the scapula. A case report and review of the literature. The scapula is a rare location for osteoid osteoma, which in most cases does not involve the flat bones. The en bloc excision in this uncommon location can be problematic since the surgical exposure is difficult, and shoulder joint function can be affected if the lesion is subchondral. In an 18-year-old man, an osteoid osteoma was located in the subchondral area of the glenoid. A guided needle biopsy of the nidus resulted in complete healing. This mode of treatment, with proper follow-up examination, is acceptable for a benign lesion situated in a problematic location. ",0
"Role of membrane proteins in monosodium urate crystal-membrane interactions. II. Effect of pretreatments of erythrocyte membranes with membrane permeable and impermeable protein crosslinking agents. Intact, human erythrocytes were pretreated with membrane permeable, dimethyl adipimidate (DMA) and dimethyl suberimidate (DMS) and membrane impermeable 3,3' dithiobis (sulfosuccinimidylpropionate) (DTSSP) protein crosslinking agents and incubated with monosodium urate monohydrate (MSUM) crystals. The percent inhibition of lysis values for pretreated cells relative to untreated cells were determined. All 3 agents caused a concentration dependent inhibition of MSUM induced hemolysis that was not due to a decrease in MSUM binding to the pretreated membranes. It was proposed that the inhibition of lysis was due to crosslinking of integral and cytoskeletal membrane proteins, resulting in a reduced mobility of the proteins, inhibition of lateralization of integral proteins into aggregates and decreased ""pore"" formation in the membrane.

"Topographic mapping of electrophysiologic measures in patients with homonymous hemianopia We analyzed electroencephalographic (EEG) activity and spatial distribution of the pattern-reversal visual evoked potential (PVEP) in 20 patients with unilateral lesions in the retrochiasmal visual pathways. Focal abnormalities that were consistent with lesion location were present in the topographically analyzed EEG or VEP of 85% of the patients, compared with a 70% detection rate for conventional analysis techniques. Quantitative analysis of spectrally analyzed EEG revealed focal abnormality in 7 patients whose conventional EEG was interpreted as either normal or diffusely slow. However, focal paroxysmal spikes present in the EEG of 1 patient were missed by EEG mapping, and a false localization of quantitative EEG abnormality contralateral to the lesion occurred in 1 patient. Topographic analysis of the PVEP was no more sensitive to retrochiasmatic lesions than conventional analysis of 2 lateral occipital electrodes. We conclude that topographic mapping is a valid technique in the detection of localized cerebral lesions. ",0
"Chondrosarcoma of the head and neck. Chondrosarcoma is a malignancy rarely encountered in the head and neck. In an attempt to define this tumor's characteristics and response to therapy, all cases of chondrosarcoma treated at the University of Michigan over the past 25 years were retrospectively studied. Fourteen cases originating in the nose and paranasal sinuses, mandible, temporal bone, and larynx were reviewed. Aggressive surgical resection was the mainstay of treatment, and resulted in an overall survival of 70%, with an average follow-up of 3.5 years. Survival was highest in primary temporal bone lesions, and lowest in paranasal sinus lesions. Unresectable lesions were not cured by other modalities. This study, therefore, continued to support the crucial role of wide surgical resection in the treatment of head and neck chondrosarcoma, but conservative resection, when needed to preserve important structures, has resulted in long-term survival.

"The prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in the Peoples Republic of China. Meta-analysis on data from 16 (two volunteer and 14 endoscopic) studies ahs been performed to investigate the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in the stomachs of individuals within the Peoples Republic of China. In this survey covering 2216 cases (89 volunteers and 2127 endoscopy patients), the incidence of H. pylori infection in 15- to 22-yr-old healthy volunteers, and in 13- to 88-yr-old symptomatic patients undergoing gastroscopy was 49.4% and 64.5%, respectively. The frequency of H. pylori infection in chronic gastritis (63.6%), gastric ulcer (71.9%), and duodenal ulcer disease (73.1%) differed significantly from that in histologically normal individuals (8.2%), confirming the relationship of H. pylori infection with those disease states. We found no significant association between H. pylori infection and symptoms. ",0
The induction dose of propofol in infants 1-6 months of age and in children 10-16 years of age. The propofol dose needed for satisfactory induction of anesthesia was determined in 22 infants 1-6 months of age and 22 children 10-16 yr of age. A single bolus of propofol was given over 10 s. Thirty seconds after injection the lid reflex was tested and the anesthesia mask was applied. The patient was considered to be asleep if there were no gross movements during the next 30 s while the patient breathed O2. The dose required for satisfactory induction in 50% of patients (ED50) (+/- SE) was 3.0 +/- 0.2 mg/kg in infants and 2.4 +/- 0.1 mg/kg in older children (P less than 0.02). Pain on injection occurred in 50% of the infants and 18% of the children. ,0
"Experimental retinal branch vein occlusion in miniature pigs induces local tissue hypoxia and vasoproliferative microangiopathy. In miniature pigs, retinal veins were experimentally occluded using argon laser coagulation. Microvascular modifications leading to retinal hemorrhages and retinal edema were observed some hours after the occlusion. These lesions resolved progressively within 3 weeks after the occlusion, but in most cases ischemic retinal territories persisted. Preretinal partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) measurements, using double barrelled O2-sensitive microelectrodes, showed that all the ischemic areas were indeed hypoxic. In half of the experiments, preretinal and intravitreal new vessels grew on the ischemic territories. Tissue hypoxia appears to be a key step in triggering neovascularization. However, the critical level of hypoxia was not determined. ",0
"Vitamin C and cancer prevention: the epidemiologic evidence. Epidemiologic evidence of a protective effect of vitamin C for non-hormone-dependent cancers is strong. Of the 46 such studies in which a dietary vitamin C index was calculated, 33 found statistically significant protection, with high intake conferring approximately a twofold protective effect compared with low intake. Of 29 additional studies that assessed fruit intake, 21 found significant protection. For cancers of the esophagus, larynx, oral cavity, and pancreas, evidence for a protective effect of vitamin C or some component in fruit is strong and consistent. For cancers of the stomach, rectum, breast, and cervix there is also strong evidence. Several recent lung cancer studies found significant protective effects of vitamin C or of foods that are better sources of vitamin C than of beta-carotene. It is likely that ascorbic acid, carotenoids, and other factors in fruits and vegetables act jointly. Increased consumption of fruits and vegetables in general should be encouraged. ",0
"Hemodynamic effects of H2-receptor antagonists. Histamine H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) often are administered to intensive care unit patients in an attempt to reduce gastric acidity and to prevent stress-related mucosal damage. These agents have an extremely low overall incidence and severity of adverse reactions; however, hemodynamically significant hypotension has been noted. Clinical studies with rapidly administered intravenous cimetidine in critically ill patients have demonstrated a depression in blood pressure in up to 75 percent of patients. Ranitidine, also studied in this setting, does not appear to induce similar hemodynamic changes. The newer H2RAs, famotidine and nizatidine, have not been evaluated in critically ill patients. ",0
"The Los Angeles experience with laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Surgeons should be competent in diagnostic laparoscopy before performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). Well-structured and endorsed courses with experienced faculty are important. Within 12 months, 418 LCs were performed in our hospital. The number of open cholecystectomies decreased to one third of all cholecystectomies performed. Cholangiography was attempted routinely and the duct was successfully cannulated in 90%. Inquiries were made at 6 other hospitals within a 5-mile radius where a total of 220 LCs were performed. The following gray areas need to be addressed: patients with slightly increased liver function tests but no jaundice, and unsuspected stones discovered by cholangiography. New projects are in progress to explore the common bile duct via the cystic duct or directly through the common bile duct with insertion of a T tube. The authors recommend proper training as well as caution and sound judgment before commencing with LC. ",0
"Removal of large symptomatic intrauterine growths by the hysteroscopic resectoscope. Fifty-three patients underwent 55 procedures with a resectoscope for the removal of large symptomatic intrauterine growths. The presenting complaint was menorrhagia, menometrorrhagia, or heavy postmenopausal bleeding in 38 patients; excessive menses plus infertility in 13 patients; and infertility alone in two patients. Forty-three patients had pedunculated or sessile submucous myomas and ten patients had large endometrial polyps. The long-term results are based on 45 patients followed for longer than 1 year. Excessive bleeding was controlled in 40 of the 43 women (93%). Failure to control abnormal bleeding was apparent within the first year. Seven of the 12 infertility patients (58%) delivered live-born infants. Five patients have undergone subsequent hysterectomies (9%). Two patients had repeat resectoscopic removal of myomas and two had subsequent non-resectoscope myomectomies. No major complications were encountered. ",0
"Analysis of side-effects of medium- and low-dose cyclosporin maintenance therapy in psoriasis. The side-effects of long-term cyclosporin A (CyA) treatment in 26 patients with severe psoriasis were evaluated. These patients had a mean PASI score of 30.2 and were treated with CyA for between 7 and 37 months (mean 19.5 months). There were three groups according to the dose of CyA, less than 2 mg/kg per day, 2-3 mg/kg per day and greater than 3 mg/kg per day. In all three groups, CyA was found to be equally effective. Treatment with CyA was discontinued in 12 of the 26 patients because of nephrotoxicity and/or development of hypertension. One was in the less than 2 mg/kg per day group, three were in the 2-3 mg/kg per day group and eight in the greater than 3 mg/kg per day group. There was no hepatotoxicity with CyA treatment. One patient developed two squamous cell carcinomas of the skin. ",0
"Survivorship analysis of total knee arthroplasty. Cumulative rates of survival of 9200 total knee arthroplasties. From 1971 through 1987, 9200 total knee arthroplasties were performed at the Mayo Clinic. Actuarial analysis was used to estimate cumulative rates of survival. Use of a proportional-hazard, general linear model led to the identification of four independent variables that were associated with a significantly lower risk of failure: primary total knee arthroplasty, a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, an age of sixty years or more, and use of a condylar prosthesis with a metal-backed tibial component. When all four of these favorable variables were present (without regard for radiographic changes and non-disabling symptoms), the probability of an implant being in situ was 97 per cent at both five and ten years.

"The effect of dopexamine HCl upon collateral perfusion of the acutely ischemic myocardium in anesthetized dogs. The effects of low-dose (10(-9) and 3 x 10(-9) mole/kg/min) infusions of dopexamine HCl, a new synthetic catecholamine with beta 2-adrenergic and DA1-dopaminergic agonostic actions, was tested in anesthetized dogs, with and without acute ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The infusions caused diastolic arterial blood pressure to fall by 12 +/- 4 and 23 +/- 5 mmHg, respectively. Microsphere-estimated collateral blood flow to the ischemic myocardium did not change significantly during the drug infusions. The findings suggest that low doses of dopexamine HCl do not cause coronary ""steal"" from acutely ischemic myocardium. ",0
"Visual illusions in a patient with lateral medullary syndrome. The disturbance of visual perception associated with nystagmus is a rare phenomenon. This is a case of a 61-year-old woman who developed progressive right hemisensory deficit, left facial sensory deficit, vertigo, staggering to the left, left ptosis, vertical diplopia, and ataxia of the left upper extremity. She had rotatory nystagmus in primary position, which increased in amplitude with left gaze. The above signs and symptoms were consistent with lateral medullary syndrome. During her rehabilitation, the patient complained of visual disturbances typical of oscillopsia. These disturbances, or illusions, are compensatory mechanisms for nystagmus and its resultant retinal error. The purpose of this case presentation was to study the pathophysiology underlying oscillopsia in patients with nystagmus and to stimulate awareness of such visual disturbances in stroke patients. ",0
"Low dose amitriptyline in chronic pain: the gain is modest. In the double-blind placebo-controlled study presented here, the effects were investigated of a low dose of amitriptyline (75 mg) in patients with chronic pain of various origins. The active drug was superior to placebo in reducing pain intensity. The reduction was small. In the second treatment week, the amitriptyline treated patients slept longer. No differences between active drug and placebo were found with respect to daily activities or use of analgesics. Based on our data and those of other studies, it is concluded that amitriptyline (and other antidepressants) in low doses does have a positive effect on the intensity and some other aspects of chronic pain, but that the effect is modest. It must be kept in mind that chronic pain is a very treatment-resistant condition. Therefore, even modest positive effects may be worthwhile. ",0
"Early identification of hearing loss: listen to parents. Families of 49 hearing-impaired children responded to a questionnaire requesting information about the identification of their child's hearing loss. Parents were the first to suspect the hearing loss in 48 cases but more often than not were told that the child would outgrow it or was too young to test. When professionals agreed with the parents and attended to their concerns, confirmation of the hearing loss occurred significantly more rapidly than when they disagreed with parents and ignored their concerns. A child whose hearing loss is not clearly identified and whose communication is inadequate or nonexistent, causes frustration and stress within the family and prevents the child from receiving the maximum benefit from early language input and amplification. It would benefit both the child and family if professionals would listen to parental concerns regarding their child and assist in the early identification process. ",0
"Early carcinoma of the gallbladder: macroscopic features and US findings. To facilitate early detection of carcinoma of the gallbladder, a comparative study of macroscopic forms and ultrasonographic (US) features of stage I (TNM staging system) gallbladder cancer was carried out retrospectively in 71 cases of such carcinomas that were resected surgically. Macroscopic forms of the lesions were classified into four types: pedunculated (eight cases), sessile (15 cases), superficial raised (25 cases), and flat (23 cases). Among 71 cases, only 20 were diagnosed preoperatively by means of US. US patterns of the lesions were also classified into four types: fungating mass, lumen filling, smooth raised, and thickening of mucosa. US features corresponded well to the macroscopic forms. No flat lesion was identified preoperatively. For early detection of carcinoma of the gallbladder, it seemed essential to pay careful attention to mild mucosal change, as more than 50% of early cancers did not show apparently protruding lesions.

"Push-enteroscopy for diagnosis of patients with gastrointestinal bleeding of obscure origin. Push-enteroscopy using a disinfected colonoscope was performed on 39 patients with gastrointestinal bleeding of obscure origin. Our results show that: (1) A high percentage of patients (38%) have pathological lesions responsible for bleeding located in the distal duodenum and proximal jejunum, which are readily detected by push-enteroscopy. (2) Duodeno-jejunal arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are the most common cause for bleeding, and these lesions can be conveniently cauterized through the endoscope. (3) An efficient sequence of steps for diagnosis of patients with this problem includes push-enteroscopy when the initial EGD and colonoscopy are normal followed by small bowel radiography. Mesenteric angiography and intraoperative enteroscopy can be reserved for patients with severe bleeding when push-enteroscopy and small bowel radiography are negative. We conclude that push-enteroscopy has an important role to play in the early assessment of patients with gastrointestinal bleeding of obscure origin. ",0
"Impact of active immunisation against enteritis necroticans in Papua New Guinea. Enteritis necroticans, known locally as pigbel, has been a major cause of illness and death among children in the highlands of Papua New Guinea. After a successful trial of active immunisation against the beta toxin of the causative organism, Clostridium perfringens type C, immunisation of children was begun in 1980. The effects of the immunisation programme on pigbel admissions in 3 of the 5 major highland hospitals were assessed. In each of the centres studied the proportion of admissions due to enteritis necroticans dropped significantly after immunisation was introduced (p less than 0.001) and hospital admissions for pigbel in 1984-86, when immunisation was well established, were less than one fifth of previous figures.

"Relative accuracy of three scintigraphic methods for determination of right ventricular ejection fraction: a correlative study with ultrafast computed tomography. The accuracy of three scintigraphic methods for determination of right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) was tested in 29 patients using ultrafast computed tomography (UFCT) as the gold standard. RVEF measurements by the ECG-gated first-pass approach showed excellent correlation with the UFCT results (r = 0.96, y = 0.06 + 0.91x), while both the standard gated acquisition blood-pool imaging (r = 0.71, y = 0.14 + 0.59x) and the nongated first-pass curve approach (r = 0.63, y = 0.18 + 0.37x) significantly underestimated RVEF. The error can be ascribed to partial inclusion of the atrial activity in the region assigned to the right ventricle. The tricuspid valve plane was found to move by a distance equal to 9%-33% (mean = 20%) of the right ventricular long-axis between systole and diastole. This translational motion was more pronounced with higher EFs. ",0
"Development of acute myelocytic leukemia in patients with Crohn's disease. In our hospital within one year two patients with Crohn's disease were seen who developed an acute myelocytic leukemia. A review of the literature reveals eight previously reported patients with both Crohn's disease and leukemia. Six of the reported 10 patients have had acute myelocytic leukemia and, interestingly, three of them, including our two patients, have shown monocytic differentiation (FAB type M4). It has been suggested that the relative risk of leukemia, especially acute myelocytic leukemia, is increased in patients suffering from ulcerative colitis. More data of patients with Crohn's disease and acute leukemia are needed to evaluate the possible association between these diseases. ",0
"Pulmonary tumor embolism to alveolar septal capillaries. A prospective study of 12 cases. Pulmonary tumor embolism leading to subacute cor pulmonale has been extensively studied. However, to our knowledge, the involvement of pulmonary alveolar capillaries has not previously been studied in detail. A prospective study was conducted on 112 autopsied patients with cancer to determine the presence of microembolism in the alveolar septal capillaries. Fifteen sections of predetermined lung areas were obtained and examined. Tumor embolism to alveolar septal capillaries was detected in 12 cases (10.7%), with simultaneous involvement of other vascular territories in 11. Seven patients had dyspnea; four, right ventricular failure; four, hypertrophy of the right ventricle; and three, arterial vascular sclerosis. The present data have led us to conclude that pulmonary tumor embolism to alveolar septal capillaries occurs in association with the involvement of arterial or lymphatic vessels and should be analyzed within the context of the study of subacute cor pulmonale.

"Diphenylhydantoin-induced hypogammaglobulinemia in a patient infected with human immunodeficiency virus. A case is reported of reversible panhypogammaglobulinemia in a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patient. Onset and resolution were temporally correlated with initiation and termination, respectively, of diphenylhydantoin therapy for a possible seizure. A rapid alteration in peripheral T-cell subpopulations was also noted in association with diphenylhydantoin administration. This case is compared with previous reports of diphenylhydantoin-associated hypogammaglobulinemia in non-HIV-infected patients. In addition, the case is discussed with regard to possible deleterious effects associated with the use of diphenylhydantoin as therapy for HIV-associated seizures or as an antiretroviral agent in HIV disease.

"Rapid control of refractory atrial tachyarrhythmias with high-dose oral amiodarone. To shorten the delay in the onset of antiarrhythmic effect when using amiodarone for the conversion of refractory atrial tachyarrhythmias to sinus rhythm, 19 patients were given oral amiodarone according to a high-dose loading protocol. In 18 of 19 patients (95%), sinus rhythm was restored 36 hours (range, 0 to 96 hours) after starting amiodarone. The conversion occurred as a result of amiodarone therapy alone within 48 hours in 12 patients (63%), and by amiodarone therapy plus electrical cardioversion at 48 to 96 hours in six patients (32%). Minor side effects were noted in eight patients (42%). No major side effects were encountered. The length of hospital stay after initiating amiodarone therapy was 3.6 days (range, 2 to 5 days). High-dose oral amiodarone loading is a safe and effective method for the rapid conversion of atrial tachyarrhythmias to sinus rhythm. ",0
"Is there a place for conservative surgery in the treatment of renal carcinoma? Since 1981, 31 patients have undergone conservative surgery for malignant renal tumours and have been followed up for at least 2 years. The techniques included enucleation or resection (wedge resection or partial nephrectomy). In 10 patients the indications for kidney-sparing surgery were absolute, while in the remainder the conservative surgical approach was a deliberate choice. The tumours varied in diameter from 1.3 to 12 cm and no metastases were detected on pre-operative screening. One patient died post-operatively from myocardial infarction. In the remaining 30 there were no local recurrences. Two patients died from skeletal metastases (1 with bilateral malignancy) and 2 underwent surgery in the post-operative period for haemorrhagic complications. The efficacy of conservative surgery in the local control of renal cancer is an argument in favour of its wider use. ",0
"Deposits of crystalline material containing silicon in surgically excised human valves. Ninety-seven surgically excised natural cardiac valves were examined by scanning electron microscopy and x-ray energy spectroscopy to assess the occurrence of crystalline deposits that contain the element silicon. Valves examined included 33 mitral valves, 63 aortic valves, and 1 tricuspid valve. To reduce the possibility of surface contamination, the deep layers of some valves were examined after exposure by fracture of the valve. Crystalline material containing silicon was observed in the deep tissue. Such crystalline material was sometimes entwined within subendothelial fibers. Crystalline deposits that contained silicon were associated with 34 of 97 of these valves (35%). Among the 34 valves that showed silicon, 24 (71%) also showed microdeposits of calcific material. In view of evidence that silicon may participate in the calcification of bone, and is found in the intima of arteries, a role for this element in ectopic calcification of valves may exist. ",0
"Cervical rotation flaps for midface resurfacing. The midface has long served as a focus for creativity in surgical reconstruction. Full-thickness skin grafts, split-thickness grafts, and distal flaps have long been used to attempt to reduplicate existing anatomy in this area. Recent reconstruction efforts have focused on the creative use of microvascular free flaps for this purpose. This article reports on the use of extensively developed regional rotation flaps as an excellent reconstructive modality for use in this area of the face. The details of surgical incisional planning are given. The nuances of surgical creation of these flaps and their rotation and suspension into place are given. The cases we have done using this technique for the past 3 years are reviewed. Our present indications for use of these flaps and their limitations are given. ",0
"Oncocytic glomus tumor of the trachea. An oncocytic variant of glomus tumor of the trachea occurred in a 47-year-old woman. She experienced intermittent cough and hemoptysis for about three years. Bronchoscopy and chest CT scan showed a small reddish polypoid tumor on the lower end of the trachea. Bronchoscopic biopsy was carefully done and was diagnosed as oncocytoma. A wedge resection of the tumor was done. Tumor cells were characterized by strongly eosinophilic granular cytoplasm on light microscopy and by numerous closely packed round or ovoid mitochondria with prominent tubular cristae on electron microscopy. They were arranged in a sheet around small vessels, as a result of which the biopsy diagnosis of oncocytoma was changed to oncocytic glomus tumor. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an oncocytic glomus tumor arising from the trachea. ",0
"Retrovirus from human T-cell leukemia virus type I-associated myelopathy is the same strain as a prototype human T-cell leukemia virus type I. A retrovirus was isolated from a T-cell line that was established from lymphocytes in the cerebrospinal fluid of a patient with human T-cell leukemia virus type I-associated myelopathy (HAM), and its genome was sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of the 3' half of the total genome was identical in 99.5% of the nucleotides to that of the prototype human T-cell leukemia virus type I that was derived from a patient with adult T-cell leukemia. These results indicate that the same retrovirus human T-cell leukemia virus type I is associated with both a neurological disease, HAM, and a lymphoproliferative disease, adult T-cell leukemia. ",0
"Safe performance of difficult laparoscopic cholecystectomies. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has been advocated for the treatment of uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease, but has not been widely advocated for the management of more complicated gallbladder disease such as acute cholecystitis, previous surgery, or common duct stones. During the last 9 months, 360 patients underwent laparoscopic removal of their gallbladder. A total of 138 had a complicated presentation, making surgery more difficult. This article discusses the management of these patients with acute cholecystitis, previous surgery, or common duct disease. Using the described techniques, there were no complications or mortality. Laparoscopic management of difficult gallbladder problems is safe and effective. ",0
"Surgical management of renal cell carcinoma with extensive intracaval involvement using a venous bypass system suitable for rapid conversion to total cardiopulmonary bypass. Renal cell carcinoma involves the vena cava in approximately 4% of the patients. Presently surgical extirpation is the only form of therapy that can result in cure. Recently management of extensive vena caval involvement has involved the use of cardiopulmonary bypass with circulatory arrest and hypothermia. We describe a technique using a venous bypass pump system (femoral vein to right atrium) for resection of renal cell carcinoma with suprahepatic vena caval extension (type II), which avoids the risks and complications of cardiac arrest and hypothermia but allows for rapid conversion to total cardiopulmonary bypass should the intraoperative need arise.

"Skeletal muscle depressed calcium and phosphofructokinase in chronic heart failure are upregulated by captopril--a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, after treatment for 5-6 weeks with 25 mg t.i.d., were studied in 12 patients with stable moderate heart failure. Five patients received placebo treatment, and the two groups were comparable at baseline. Angiotensin II levels decreased in response to captopril therapy. Skeletal muscle potassium, magnesium and chloride levels did not differ from reference values. Calcium was subnormal (P less than 0.0001), but increased to the reference range during captopril treatment. Phosphofructokinase, a rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme, was in the lower reference range and increased (P less than 0.04) in response to captopril therapy. In conclusion, stable moderate heart failure is associated with low levels of skeletal muscle calcium and phosphofructokinase activity, these metabolic changes tending to return to normal levels with captopril treatment.

"Retroviral recombination and reverse transcription. Recombination occurs at a high rate in retroviral replication, and its observation requires a virion containing two different RNA molecules (heterodimeric particles). Analysis of retroviral recombinants formed after a single round of replication revealed that (i) the nonselected markers changed more frequently than expected from the rate of recombination of selected markers; (ii) the transfer of the initially synthesized minus strand strong stop DNA was either intramolecular or intermolecular; (iii) the transfer of the first synthesized plus strand strong stop DNA was always intramolecular; and (iv) there was a strong correlation between the type of transfer of the minus strand strong stop DNA and the number of template switches observed. These data suggest that retroviral recombination is ordered and occurs during the synthesis of both minus and plus strand DNA. ",0
"Seizure disorders in Down syndrome. The prevalence, onset, and type of seizure disorders, as well as seizure control, were studied in a large cohort of 405 individuals with Down syndrome (age range, 6 months to 45 years). The evaluation of a questionnaire completed by the subjects' parents and of the patients' medical records indicated that 33 (8.1%) of 405 persons with Down syndrome had seizure disorder. With regard to the onset of seizures, a bimodal distribution was noted: 40% of patients began having seizures before the age of 1 year, and another 40% started with seizure activity in the third decade of life. In the younger age group, primarily infantile spasms and tonic-clonic seizures with myoclonus were observed, and the older patients often had partial simplex or partial complex seizures as well as tonic-clonic seizures.

"Rupture of atheromatous plaque as a cause of thrombotic occlusion of stenotic internal carotid artery. We analyzed the clinical profiles and autopsy findings of five patients who died shortly after developing cerebral infarction following thrombotic occlusion of the internal carotid artery. In all five cases, thrombotic occlusion was caused by rupture of the fibrous lining over the gruel of atheroma at the origin of the internal carotid artery showing tight stenosis of the lumen. The mean +/- SD shorter diameter of the lumen at the site of occlusion was 1.5 +/- 0.4 mm. Our results show that an internal carotid artery with tight stenosis of the lumen by atheroma containing gruel harbors a risk of thrombotic occlusion, which may give rise to cerebral infarction by artery-to-artery embolism or by reduced cerebral perfusion.

"Chronic hyperglycemia increases the density of glucose transporters in human erythrocyte membranes. We investigated the effect of chronic hyperglycemia on glucose transporters in erythrocytes of subjects with and without diabetes mellitus. We found a 22% increase in D-glucose-displaceable cytochalasin-B binding in erythrocyte membranes of diabetic subjects over those of controls (311 +/- 13 vs. 254 +/- 8 pmol/mg protein; P less than 0.001). This increased binding was due to a higher density of binding sites without a significant change in binding affinity. Cytochalasin-B binding to erythrocyte membrane correlated positively with both erythrocyte glycohemoglobin and serum glucose levels, but not with plasma C-peptide levels. The data are compatible with up-regulation of glucose transporters in the erythrocytes of subjects with chronic hyperglycemia. We suspect that this is brought about by increased synthesis and membrane incorporation of the glucose transporter during erythropoiesis. ",0
"The management of mid-face fractures with intracranial injury. Recent advances have radically changed the management of facial fractures. CT scanning, extensive exposure, and rigid plate fixation in the setting of the trauma center have permitted early operation with improved results. A subset of patients with facial fractures will also have intracranial injuries (ICI). We sought to identify parameters associated with an increased risk for ICI. We also sought to examine the safety and limits of early craniofacial repair in patients with intracranial injuries. Of 114 mid-face fractures treated over a 1-year period, 43 (38%) had a concomitant ICI. The majority, 36 (84%), were from motor vehicle accidents (MVA). Frontal sinus and orbitoethmoid fractures were at the highest risk for ICI, although orbitozygomatic fractures caused by MVAs also had a surprisingly high incidence of ICI. Our results show that early craniofacial repair can be performed safely with appropriate general surgical and neurosurgical support. ",0
"Identification of transforming growth factor beta family members present in bone-inductive protein purified from bovine bone. Characterization of the polypeptides present in bone-inductive protein extracts from bovine bone has led to the cloning of seven regulatory molecules, six of which are distantly related to transforming growth factor beta. The three human bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) we describe herein, BMP-5, BMP-6, and BMP-7, show extensive sequence similarity to BMP-2, a molecule that by itself is sufficient to induce de novo bone formation in vivo. The additive or synergistic contribution of these BMP-2-related molecules to the osteogenic activity associated with demineralized bone is strongly implicated by the presence of these growth factors in the most active fractions of highly purified bone extract.

"Endovascular occlusion of vertebral arteries in the treatment of unclippable vertebrobasilar aneurysms. Twenty-one patients with aneurysms of the vertebrobasilar circulation underwent unilateral or bilateral endovascular occlusion of the vertebral artery. Six patients presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), 10 with mass effect, four with mass effect and SAH, and one with ischemic symptoms. Thirteen patients had good outcomes with complete clinical and angiographic cure. Six patients had partial thrombosis of their aneurysms. There was one death and one treatment failure. One patient suffered transient stroke. It is concluded that endovascular occlusion of the vertebral artery following test occlusion is a safe and effective treatment for proximal aneurysms of the vertebrobasilar circulation. ",0
"Oral contraceptives and breast cancer. Among women in general the risk of breast cancer through 59 years of age does not appear to be affected appreciably by the use of oral contraceptives. Nonetheless, concern continues to be expressed about the effects of early age at first use, long-term duration of use, formulation, and a variety of other factors thought to influence breast cancer risk in the presence of oral contraception. A number of recent studies restricted to young women suggest that long-term use may increase the risk of disease occurring very early, but the present lack of consistent findings in well-conducted epidemiologic studies prevents any certain conclusion with regard to cause-and-effect. However, if an increased risk were indeed present, the most plausible interpretation is that long-term oral contraception promotes earlier clinical manifestation of breast cancer in some women while having no net impact on their lifetime risk of the disease.

"Abscess of the sphenoid sinus after transsphenoidal surgery. A case of a bacterial abscess developing in the sphenoid sinus 2 weeks after transsphenoidal surgery is presented. Although abscesses within the sella turcica have been reported as rare complications of transsphenoidal surgery, this is the first reported case of the postoperative formation of an abscess of the sphenoid sinus. The patient sought treatment for severe headaches, nausea and vomiting, and marked temperature elevation. A computed tomographic scan demonstrated soft tissue and air within the sphenoid sinus. A regimen of stress doses of hydrocortisone and antibiotics was prescribed, and the patient underwent transsphenoidal drainage of the sphenoid sinus. The sella turcica was not involved. Anaerobic cultures were positive for Fusobacterium necrophorum. ",0
"The pathology of heart allograft rejection. The pathologist plays an important role in the care of cardiac transplant recipients. Day-to-day management of immunosuppression is largely dependent on the diagnosis and grading of acute rejection. While noninvasive methods have been tried experimentally, the endomyocardial biopsy remains the gold standard in monitoring the rejection status of the heart allograft. The diagnosis of rejection, however, is complicated by a variety of other histologic findings, which may be procedural or processing related, due to sampling, or specifically related to transplantation. Failed allografts, whether from autopsy or explantation, provide the opportunity to study short- and long-term changes in the transplanted heart. Allograft arteriopathy, or graft atherosclerosis, is the major limiting factor in long-term recipient survival. While the morphological features of graft arteriopathy have been well described, the mechanism and factors contributing to its development remain unclear. ",0
"Cerebral blood flow in progressive aphasia without dementia. Case report, using 133xenon inhalation, technetium 99m hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime and single photon emission computerized tomography. We report a case of progressive aphasia without clinical signs of intellectual or behavioral impairment, satisfying Mesulam's clinical criteria of primary progressive aphasia, as 4 yrs of extensive psychometric testing and radiological imaging, comprising CT and MRI, failed to detect evidence of relevant involvement outside the left perisylvian regions. Cranial CT was normal but MRI showed multiple bilateral lesions in the deep white matter. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) studies by single photon emission computerized tomography, however, showed an initial frontotemporal focus of hypoperfusion that progressively extended to include most of the ipsilateral hemisphere and the contralateral frontal lobe. This suggests that CBF imaging may yet be the most sensitive technique in revealing subclinical injury in the degenerative brain diseases of focal onset. ",0
"Definitive mandibular replacement using reconstruction plates. Mandibular defects following radical cancer surgery continue to provide challenges to head and neck surgeons. Twenty-seven patients with advanced oral cancer underwent primary mandibular replacement with metal reconstruction plates without the use of bone. Twenty-one patients (78%) had successful reconstruction with primary soft tissue healing. Six patients required removal of the plate in the postoperative period. Two of these patients had their reconstruction plates replaced as a secondary procedure following soft tissue healing. Thus, 23 of 27 patients (85%) had final mandibular reconstruction and were followed for an average of 19 months. Functional and cosmetic results were satisfactory. For patients with advanced disease, this technique compares favorably with microvascular transfer in terms of operating time and donor defect. Despite problems with plate exposure, the initial and overall success rates of 78% and 85%, respectively, make the use of these plates a reasonable choice for immediate reconstructive needs in patients with difficult tumors.

Intra-abdominal abscesses in Crohn's disease. We reviewed 22 patients who had intra-abdominal abscesses secondary to Crohn's disease. A total of 29 abscesses were discovered. These included superficial and deep intraperitoneal as well as pelvic and retroperitoneal abscesses. Diagnosis was aided by ultrasound and computer tomographic scanning. Barium studies continue to play an important role in delineating the extent of bowel involvement and fistulization. Treatment varied depending on the location and size of the abscess. The need for ultimate bowel resection was determined in the majority of cases by the presence of fistulization between the abscess cavity and the bowel. The terminal ileum or neoterminal ileum were almost always involved. ,0
"Systemic mast cell disease associated with primary mediastinal germ cell tumor. The first known case of systemic mast cell disease associated with a germ cell tumor is reported. Six months after the complete remission of a primary mediastinal germ cell tumor treated by chemotherapy and resection, a young man had a series of episodes of hypotension and syncope and, a few months later, a gastric hemorrhage and coagulation disorder. The diagnosis of systemic mast cell disease was made in view of bone marrow and liver biopsies. A transient circulating heparin-like anticoagulant was noted. The occurrence in a short period of these two unusual conditions, given previous knowledge of hematologic disorders associated with germ cell tumors, suggests that the present association is not a coincidence. Systemic mast cell disease should be considered among the hematologic disorders associated with a germ cell tumor. ",0
"Inflammatory pseudotumor of intra-abdominal lymph nodes manifesting as recurrent fever of unknown origin: a case report. A 27-year-old man presented with a 7-month history of debilitating recurrent fever and weight loss. Extensive clinical evaluation led to the discovery of splenomegaly and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. The patient underwent splenectomy as well as liver and lymph node biopsy. Histologic examination of the lymph nodes, but not the liver and spleen, revealed inflammatory pseudotumor of lymph nodes. The patient has remained asymptomatic for more than 3 years following the surgical procedure despite the absence of further intervention. Inflammatory pseudotumor of lymph nodes should be considered in the differential evaluation of prolonged or relapsing fever of unknown etiology. ",0
"Antibiotic use among children in an urban Brazilian slum: a risk factor for diarrhea? [published erratum appears in Am J Public Health 1991 Apr;81(4):417] Among a cohort of children in a poor urban setting in Brazil, the relative risk for the occurrence of a new episode of diarrhea in the two weeks following antibiotic use vs all other weeks was 1.44 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.33, 2.45). Among children ever [corrected] exposed to antibiotics, the odds ratio was 1.34 (95% CI = 0.84, 2.16) after stratifying by individual child and controlling for previous diarrhea. Further research is needed to confirm whether antibiotics are a risk factor for diarrhea in such settings. ",0
"Acquired Lutembacher syndrome or mitral stenosis and acquired atrial septal defect after transseptal mitral valvuloplasty. Critical mitral stenosis in selected patients may be treated successfully with percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty. Complications of this procedure, particularly an atrial septal defect following transseptal approach, are generally of minor clinical significance. We describe a woman who initially underwent a successful percutaneous double-balloon mitral valvuloplasty via the transseptal approach. Three months later she presented with right-sided heart failure. Color Doppler echocardiography and cardiac catheterization demonstrated an atrial septal defect (ASD) as well as restenosis of the mitral valve. We conclude that significant ASDs may occur following transseptal mitral valvuloplasty with appearance of right ventricular failure and that color Doppler imaging aids in the diagnosis of this new variant of the classical Lutembacher syndrome.

A controlled trial of community based coronary rehabilitation. Two hundred patients who had suffered an acute myocardial infarction 4-6 weeks before entered a randomised controlled trial of exercise treatment at a community sports centre supervised by a general practitioner. Eighty one per cent of the treatment group continued to exercise until they returned to work and 73% completed three months' exercise. There were no serious complications of the exercise course. The prevalence of angina pectoris fell by 10% in the treatment group but rose by 60% in the control group. The perceived energy level rose by significantly more in the treatment group than in the controls. The rise in predicted maximum oxygen uptake was significantly greater in the treatment group than in the control group as was the reduction in the double product (a reflection of myocardial workload) at peak exercise. Coronary rehabilitation in the community can be both safe and effective. ,0
"Treatment of ventricular tachycardia induced cardiogenic shock by percoronary chemical ablation. Incessant ventricular arrhythmias pose an especially challenging therapeutic dilemma. We describe the successful treatment and follow-up of a patient with refractory ventricular tachycardia-induced cardiogenic shock with percoronary chemical ablation. After endocardial mapping was used to identify the ""tachycardia-related"" coronary artery, temporary termination of the arrhythmia with balloon occlusion and subselective intracoronary installation of iced saline as previously advocated was unsuccessful. This was probably due to a dual arterial blood supply to the arrhythmogenic focus. However, infusion of 2 cc ethanol (99%) permanently terminated the arrhythmia. Contrary to previous experience, ethanol-induced arrhythmia termination did not result in arterial occlusion, further supporting a direct toxic effect on the myocardium as its mode of action. Use of standard angioplasty balloon inflation prevents ""backwash"" of distally infused ethanol and more generalized cell death. The only complication of this procedure was temporary third-degree AV block, requiring permanent pacemaker implantation. ",0
"Poisoning with equine phenylbutazone in a racetrack worker. Phenylbutazone is a potent nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory drug often used by veterinarians to treat racetrack animals. Its use in human beings is limited because of significant adverse effects and the availability of newer, safer drugs. We report the case of a 24-year-old man who ingested 17 g of equine phenylbutazone over a 24-hour period to treat the pain of a toothache. He developed grand mal seizures, coma, hypotension, respiratory and renal failure, and hepatic injury. Serum phenylbutazone concentration obtained approximately eight hours after presentation was 900 micrograms/mL. The patient recovered during six weeks of intensive supportive care and repeated hemodialysis. ",0
"Reduction of post-traumatic swelling and compartment pressure by impulse compression of the foot. Following the discovery of a powerful venous pump in the foot that is activated by weight-bearing independently of muscular action, a pneumatic impulse device was developed to actuate this pump artificially. In a multicentre international trial the device was shown to reduce post-traumatic and postoperative swelling; pain also was alleviated. Evidence is also presented that dangerously high compartment pressures may be reduced to acceptable levels and fasciotomy avoided. We present an explanation of the clinical effects of activation of the venous footpump, based on recent improved understanding of the physiology of the microcirculation. The hyperaemic response that follows the liberation of endothelial-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) by sudden changes of pressure after weight-bearing or impulse compression is particularly important.

"Variations on the temporoparietal fascial flap. An improved understanding of the vascular supply of the layers of the temporal fossa has increased the potential of this region for new and ingenious reconstructive techniques. Separate and independently vascularized layers of this region include hair-bearing scalp, glabrous skin, tempororoparietal fascia (and galea aponeurotica), temporalis muscle and fascia, and pericranium. Island flaps of glabrous skin and scalp provided esthetically appropriate tissue to cover a variety of defects. The malleable bulk of the subcutaneous fascial layers were combined with skin grafts to restore thin lining, and used as a vascularized bed for cartilage grafts in otherwise unsatisfactory recipient sites. Illustrative cases from our 5-year clinical experience are presented to demonstrate various combinations of the temporoparietal fascial pedicle with tissues from the temporal region to reconstruct the eyebrows, eyelids, orbits, cheeks, and lips.

"Features of ""near-death experience"" in relation to whether or not patients were near death The medical records of 58 patients, most of whom believed they were near death during an illness or after an injury and all of whom later remembered unusual experiences occurring at the time, were examined. 28 patients were judged to have been so close to death that they would have died without medical intervention; the other 30 patients were not in danger of dying although most of them thought they were. Patients of both groups reported closely similar experiences but patients who really were close to death were more likely than those who were not to report an enhanced perception of light and enhanced cognitive powers. The claim of enhancement of cognitive functions despite the likelihood that brain function had probably become disturbed and possibly diminished, deserves further investigation. ",0
"Leukemias of indeterminant lineage. Two biologically and clinically important forms of acute leukemia have been described. Evidence suggests that both undifferentiated acute leukemia and many types of hybrid leukemia arise from relatively fewer differentiated cells than do the more straightforward acute leukemias. Clinical correlations suggest that patients with these leukemias may have a poorer prognosis, although some findings may be associated with an improved prognosis. More data in which multiple techniques are applied to the same leukemic cells are clearly needed. Patients with certain types of hybrid leukemias may be suitable candidates for more aggressive forms of chemotherapy or, possibly, combinations of therapy directed at cells of both lineages. ",0
"Efficacy of percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty with the inoue balloon. Percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty has become an accepted technique for use in selected patients with severe, symptomatic mitral stenosis. Recently, a new balloon catheter with an ""hourglass"" shape and specially designed guidewires and dilators has become available (Inoue balloon). The design of this balloon provides ease of manipulation and self-stabilization across the mitral valve during inflation. These features should decrease the incidence of complications associated with the procedure. Preliminary results in 12 consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty with the Inoue balloon are presented. The mitral valve area increased from 0.92 +/- 0.21 cm2 before the procedure to 1.75 +/- 0.40 cm2 after the procedure. No complications occurred from the procedure, including no increase in severity of mitral regurgitation or creation of an atrial septal defect. Further follow-up is necessary to determine the long-term efficacy with this new balloon. Nonetheless, the preliminary results are encouraging. ",0
"Thallous chloride uptake and DNA profile in parathyroid adenomas. Thallium isotope scintigraphy is used to localize parathyroid adenomas but the mechanism underlying the technique is poorly understood. While larger adenomas are reliably localized the results are less certain for small tumours. This study explores the relationship between cellular DNA profile and thallium uptake (localization accuracy) in 24 parathyroid adenomas. The DNA profile was assessed using flow cytometry and standard subtraction thallium scintigraphy was performed before surgery. Fifteen of the 24 adenomas demonstrated excessive mitotic activity and 13 of these glands were accurately localized. Of the remaining nine glands, only five were localized accurately (P less than 0.01, chi 2 test including Yates' correction). This difference in thallium uptake could not be accounted for on the basis of gland weight. Thallium localization of parathyroid adenomas is related to mitotic activity. This may explain some of the limitations of this technique. ",0
"Fetal alcohol syndrome in adolescents and adults. Fetal alcohol syndrome is a specific recognizable pattern of malformation. Manifestations in 61 adolescents and adults suffering from alcohol teratogenesis are presented. After puberty, the faces of patients with fetal alcohol syndrome or fetal alcohol effects were not as distinctive. Patients tended to remain short and microcephalic, although their weight was somewhat closer to the mean. The average IQ was 68, but the range of IQ scores widely varied. Average academic functioning was at the second- to fourth-grade levels, with arithmetic deficits most characteristic. Maladaptive behaviors such as poor judgment, distractibility, and difficulty perceiving social cues were common. Family environments were remarkably unstable. Fetal alcohol syndrome is not just a childhood disorder; there is a predictable long-term progression of the disorder into adulthood, in which maladaptive behaviors present the greatest challenge to management.

"Colorectal adenocarcinoma in patients less than 40 years of age. From 1973 to 1985, 105 patients under 40 years of age were treated for colorectal adenocarcinoma at Roswell Park Cancer Institute. There were 51 males and 54 females. The mean age was 32 years. The majority of patients were treated for left colon or rectal carcinomas. Ninety-seven of 105 patients underwent surgical resection of their primary cancer, 70 (67 percent) of which were potentially curative. Twenty-seven patients underwent palliative resections. Dukes' A or B lesions were not seen in patients less than 20 years old, whereas these early lesions were seen in 11 percent of patients 20 to 29 years old and in 26 percent of patients greater than 30 years of age. The mean survival for patients between 20 and 29 years was 39 months and 46 months for patients 30 years and older. ",0
"Specificity of affective and autonomic symptoms of depression in Parkinson's disease. Previous investigators have suggested that numerous symptoms used to diagnose depression, such as sleep or appetite disturbance, are non-specific in medically ill patients, and alternative diagnostic criteria should be developed. In the study this hypothesis was tested in Parkinson's disease (PD) by comparing patients with PD who reported a depressive mood with patients having PD but without a depressive mood. Depressed patients showed a significantly higher frequency of both autonomic and affective symptoms of depression. Depressed patients with PD reported a significantly higher frequency of worrying, brooding, loss of interest, hopelessness, suicidal tendencies, social withdrawal, self-depreciation, ideas of reference, anxiety symptoms, loss of appetite, initial and middle insomnia, and loss of libido when compared with non-depressed patients. No significant between-group differences, however, were observed in the frequency of anergia, motor retardation, and early morning awakening. ",0
"Late recurrence of varus deformity after proximal tibial osteotomy. One hundred thirteen knees with medial gonarthrosis in 95 patients were treated by valgus-producing proximal tibial osteotomy and followed clinically and roentgenographically for a minimum of five years (mean, 6.3 years). Sixty-four knees (57%) were pain free or had only mild discomfort when walking. The standing femorotibial angle decreased from a postoperative average of 9.3 degrees valgus to 7.8 degrees valgus at the final follow-up examination. The tendency for varus recurrence greater than 5 degrees and for medial- or lateral-compartment arthritic progression was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier survival method. Varus recurred in 18%, lateral-compartment arthritic progression in 60%, and medial-compartment arthritic progression in 83% by nine years after surgery. The probability of arthritic progression is much higher than the probability of significant varus recurrence in long-term roentgenographic follow-up studies of patients with valgus-producing proximal tibial osteotomies.

"Myocardial infarction prognostic scoring system. A myocardial infarction prognostic scoring system for patients treated in a coronary care unit is described. The prognostic significance of 22 variables, all which were available on admission, were analyzed. A prognostic index was then constructed by a modified stepwise logistic regressional analysis technique. The variables that were used in the scoring system were Killip hemodynamic class, infarct location, and the maximal ST segment elevation in a single lead. The scoring system was validated in an independent group of patients, including a group of patients treated with intravenous streptokinase. The scoring system may prove to be useful for individual patient prognostication and management strategies, and for the quantification of infarct severity for use in clinical studies. ",0
"Silent myocardial ischemia and infarction in diabetics with peripheral vascular disease: assessment by dipyridamole thallium-201 scintigraphy. We investigated the incidence of silent myocardial ischemia and infarction as assessed by dipyridamole thallium scintigraphy in 30 diabetic patients with peripheral vascular disease and without clinical suspicion of coronary artery disease. Seventeen patients (57%) had thallium abnormalities, with reversible thallium defects compatible with ischemia in 14 patients (47%) and evidence of prior, clinically silent myocardial infarction in 11 patients (37%). Thallium abnormalities were most frequent in patients with concomitant hypertension and cigarette smoking (p = 0.001). These results suggest that unsuspected coronary artery disease is common in this particular group of patients with diabetes mellitus. ",0
"Celiac disease, brain atrophy, and dementia. We report 5 patients who developed dementia before age 60 and were subsequently found to have celiac disease (CD). Intellectual deterioration ranged from moderate to severe, and diffuse cerebral or cerebellar atrophy was found on brain CT. Diagnosis of CD was confirmed by findings of subtotal villous atrophy in jejunal biopsy specimens and positive serum reticulin and gliadin antibodies. Conspicuously, gastrointestinal symptoms were mild. The gluten-free diet failed to improve the neurologic disability except in 1 patient. CD is a multisystem disorder and may play a role in some cases of presenile dementia. Although the pathogenetic mechanisms are obscure, immunologic mechanisms are implicated. ",0
Parathyroid hormone-like peptide in normal and neoplastic mesothelial cells. Mesothelioma has not been commonly reported as a cause of hypercalcemia of malignancy. We have studied a patient with malignant mesothelioma and hypercalcemia in association with elevated plasma concentrations of parathyroid hormone-like peptide (PLP). Immunohistochemical analysis of the tumor and seven of eight other mesotheliomas that were not associated with hypercalcemia revealed the presence of PLP cytoplasmic immunopositivity. PLP immunopositivity was also detected in normal and reactive mesothelial cells. The results of these studies suggest that PLP immunoreactivity is common in normal and neoplastic mesothelial cells and raises the possibility that PLP production may play a role in the pathogenesis of hypercalcemia associated with mesothelioma. ,0
"Further mapping of an ataxia-telangiectasia locus to the chromosome 11q23 region. We recently mapped the gene for ataxia-telangiectasia group A (ATA) to chromosome 11q22-23 by linkage analysis, using the genetic markers THY1 and pYNB3.12 (D11S144). The most likely order was cent-AT-S144-THY1. The present paper describes further mapping of the AT locus by means of a panel of 10 markers that span approximately 60 cM in the 11q22-23 region centered around S144 and THY1. Location scores indicate that three contiguous subsegments within the [S144-THY1] segment, as well as three contiguous segments telomeric to THY1, are each unlikely to contain the AT locus, while the more centromeric [STMY-S144] segment is most likely to contain the AT locus. These data, together with recent refinements in the linkage and physical maps of 11q22-23, place the AT locus at 11q23. ",0
"Ganglioglioma: a clinical study with long-term follow-up. Gangliogliomas are uncommon tumors of mixed neoplastic glial and neuronal elements. Because of their low incidence, few large series exist that fully describe the clinical characteristics of patients afflicted with this tumor. We have reviewed the medical records of 20 patients at Duke University Medical Center with histologically proven gangliogliomas. These patients typically presented within the first three decades of life and their most common presenting symptom was seizures. Therapies included surgical resection, either partial or total, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy. Long-term follow-up was achieved by chart review and by telephone interview. Patients who underwent gross total resection alone seemed to fare the best when comparing all treatment groups, and we therefore recommend this as the main form of treatment. ",0
"Intraoperative scintigraphy for active small intestinal bleeding. Localizing active sites of bleeding within the small intestine remains a difficult task. Endoscopic, angiographic or scintigraphic studies may point to the small intestine as the site of blood loss, but at operation, without a palpable lesion, the exact site of bleeding remains elusive. Patients are managed at laparotomy with intraoperative endoscopy, angiography, multiple enterotomies, ""blind"" resections, or placement of an enterostomy. We describe two patients in whom intraoperative scintigraphy accurately identified active sites of bleeding in the small intestine when other modalities failed. Intraoperative scintigraphy is rapid, easy to perform and is an effective means of identifying active sites of bleeding within the small intestine. ",0
"Patient perception of tics and other movement disorders. To determine the subjective perception patients have of abnormal movements, 170 patients with various hyperkinesias were interviewed with questions directed at the ""voluntary"" or intentional versus ""involuntary"" aspects of their symptoms. One hundred and two of 110 patients with non-tic disorders thought that the abnormal movements were entirely involuntary. Forty-one of 60 tic disorder patients stated that all their motor and phonic tics were intentionally produced. Fifteen others had both voluntary and involuntary components, usually with the former predominating. A ""voluntary"" response could be used to predict the correct diagnostic category (tic versus non-tic) in 8 of 9 patients for whom the referral category was incorrect. These results suggest that a large proportion of the motor and phonic symptoms experienced by tic patients are irresistibly but purposefully executed, more akin to compulsions than to the other ""involuntary"" hyperkinesias with which they are commonly discussed.

"Clinical efficacy of flosequinan in heart failure. The effects of the new arterial and venous vasodilator flosequinan have been evaluated in a variety of ways in different groups of patients with chronic heart failure. Flosequinan improved the central hemodynamic effects of heart failure in one group, with benefits still apparent up to 24 hours after a single oral dose. In another group it also improved calf blood flow and, therefore, blood flow to skeletal muscle. Also, using a number of different tests, it improved the exercise performance of the patients. In a further group the improvement in exercise tolerance produced was similar to that of captopril. Flosequinan has the necessary properties of a drug that is likely to be of benefit in the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure. ",0
Foci of increased T2 signal intensity in MR images of healthy elderly subjects. A follow-up study. An 18-month follow-up study was conducted on 26 healthy elderly subjects with and without foci of increased T2 signal intensity on MR imaging. The subjects did not differ with respect to health status or cognitive performance as measured by the Cognitive Subscale of the Cambridge Mental Disorders of the Elderly Examination and the Mini Mental State Examination at follow-up. There was a significant decline in performance on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test in subjects who had evidence of T2 foci compared to the performance of subjects without T2 foci. This may indicate that the presence of T2 foci is correlated with subtle difficulties in learning and memory. ,0
"Surgery for acute and chronic cholecystitis. Cholecystostomy and cholecystectomy remain appropriate and effective therapy for acute and chronic cholecystitis. Cholecystectomy is the gold standard against which all alternative methods of treatment of inflammatory biliary stone disease should be judged. The pathogenesis, diagnosis, and surgical treatment of acute and chronic cholecystitis have been described. Techniques of cholecystostomy, cholecystectomy, and intraoperative cholangiography used by the author have been given. Our results and those generally described in the literature indicate that the overall mortality rate for cholecystectomy, in all age groups, is approximately 0.5%. This rate increases slightly in patients with acute cholecystitis and in those over the age of 65 years. Cholecystectomy remains the most effective and the definitive treatment for acute and chronic cholecystitis. ",0
"Fludarabine: a new agent with marked cytoreductive activity in untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Thirty-three patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with advanced Rai stage (III-IV) or progressive Rai stage (0-II) disease were treated with fludarabine as a single agent. Eleven patients (33%) obtained a complete remission (CR), 13 (39%) a clinical CR with residual nodules as the only evidence of disease (nodular partial remission [PR]), and two patients (6%) achieved a PR for a total response rate of 79%. Response was rapid, usually occurring after three to six courses of treatment. The major morbidity was infection. Febrile episodes occurred in 13% of the courses (pneumonia 6%, minor infection 4%, and transient fever of undocumented cause 3%). Fludarabine appears to be the most cytoreductive single agent so far studied in CLL. ",0
"Chronic diarrhea in essential mixed cryoglobulinemia: a manifestation of visceral vasculitis? Gastrointestinal involvement occurs frequently in essential mixed cryoglobulinemia, and most often involves the liver and spleen. Intestinal involvement is much less common and is generally felt to be a late and often catastrophic manifestation of the disease due to severe vasculitis. Occasionally, the disorder mimics inflammatory bowel disease, both clinically and radiographically. We recently cared for a patient with essential mixed cryoglobulinemia who developed persistent diarrhea. Endoscopic evaluation revealed scattered petechial lesions in the duodenum and colon as well as prominent lymphoid hyperplasia in the terminal ileum. Mucosal biopsies disclosed the presence of diffuse inflammation. We suggest that this patient's diarrhea was due to intestinal vasculitis and that prominent ileal lymphoid hyperplasia may be a manifestation of essential mixed cryoglobulinemia. ",0
"An objective appraisal of the role of computed tomographic (CT) guided drainage of intra-abdominal abscesses. Computed tomographic (CT) guided drainage is an important tool in the treatment of intra-abdominal abscess. Its most important role is in the treatment of small, unilocular, well-placed abscesses. Success rates in our experience diminish considerably in abscesses involving necrotic tumors or those infected with yeast. As is frequently characteristic of new technologic procedures, the initial evaluation of the success rate of the procedure is overly optimistic. The procedure carries a considerable complication rate (13%) and mortality rate (15%). Most importantly, success is usually evident early; within the first 24 to 48 hours. After this length of time, careful evaluation to consider further treatment should be contemplated. ",0
"Development of language in six hemispherectomized patients. The development of language skills in the isolated right hemisphere was investigated by comparing the performance of 3 left hemispherectomized with that of the 3 right hemispherectomized patients and three groups of control subjects on baseline clinical measures of language and on production and judgement of morphological markers. The initial brain insult in the hemispherectomy patients of each group had occurred either during early, middle or late childhood. The left hemispherectomy patients were severely impaired in language processing across all three stages of language development. The consequences of a right hemisphere insult on language development were more restricted, with deleterious effects being apparent only in the case in which the lesion was acquired during early childhood.

"Veterans Administration Cooperative Study Group on Hypertensive Agents: effects of age on treatment results. In three double-blind studies of 1,396 hypertensive patients, the age-related effects of hydrochlorothiazide or bendroflumethazide were compared with those of propranolol, nadolol, or captopril, given singly or in combination with a thiazide. Patients in each treatment group were divided into those aged 55 to 69 years and those aged under 55. Whereas no age-related differences were apparent with propranolol, nadolol alone, or captopril alone, in all three studies the blood pressure-reducing effect was found to be greater in the older group of thiazide-treated patients than in the younger thiazide-treated group. The antihypertensive drugs studied are at least as effective in older as in younger hypertensive patients and the antihypertensive response with diuretics is greater in older patients than in younger patients.

"Lower extremity revascularization via the lateral plantar artery. Lower extremity bypass grafts to the tibial and crural arteries are commonly employed to treat patients with atherosclerotic limb-threatening ischemia. Although occasional series have mentioned bypasses to a plantar artery, few of these specifically examine the results of arterial reconstructions using these vessels. Six patients underwent femoral to lateral plantar artery (LPA) bypass within a 19-month period for gangrene of the forefoot. There was one early graft failure and in the five completely autogenous reconstructions, graft patency and limb salvage had been achieved during a follow-up ranging from three to 22 months. The LPA is an acceptable site for anastomosis of lower extremity bypass grafts and the early results presented herein support its more liberal use when proximal sites are unavailable. ",0
"The J-curve phenomenon and the treatment of hypertension. Is there a point beyond which pressure reduction is dangerous? We critically appraised the medical literature to evaluate whether there is a point beyond which blood pressure reduction in hypertensive subjects is no longer beneficial and possibly even deleterious. Thirteen studies that stratified cardiovascular outcomes by level of achieved blood pressure in treated hypertensive subjects who had been followed up for at least 1 year were critiqued by four independent reviewers. Data addressing population, protocol, and methodological characteristics were evaluated. Studies did not show a consistent J-shaped relationship between treated blood pressure and stroke, but they did demonstrate a consistent J-shaped relationship for cardiac events and diastolic blood pressure. The beneficial therapeutic threshold point was 85 mm Hg. We conclude that low treated diastolic blood pressure levels, ie, below 85 mm Hg, are associated with increased risk of cardiac events. ",0
"Direct visualization of ruptured chordae tendineae by transesophageal two-dimensional echocardiography. To determine the value of transesophageal echocardiography in the detection of ruptured chordae tendineae, 28 patients who had surgical therapy for pure mitral regurgitation were evaluated prospectively by conventional transthoracic and transesophageal two-dimensional echocardiography. Seventeen patients (Group I) had ruptured chordae tendineae and 11 (Group II) had intact chordae tendineae. Transthoracic echocardiography detected ruptured chordae tendineae in 6 patients from Group I (sensitivity 35%) and flail leaflets in 11 patients from Group I (sensitivity 65%). Transesophageal echocardiography disclosed ruptured chordae tendineae in all 17 Group I patients (sensitivity 100%); the sensitivity was significantly higher than that of transthoracic echocardiography. No abnormal chordal echoes were visualized in any patient from Group II by either transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography (specificity 100%). Transesophageal echocardiography is a highly sensitive method for detecting ruptured chordae tendineae and is superior to transthoracic echocardiography in establishing its diagnosis. ",0
"Evolution of the continuity equation in the Doppler echocardiographic assessment of the severity of valvular aortic stenosis. The use of Doppler techniques has greatly enhanced the noninvasive ultrasound technique for evaluation of valvular aortic stenosis. M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiography could not reliably distinguish patients with severe aortic stenosis from those with milder obstructions. The hemodynamic information offered by Doppler complemented echocardiographic imaging and provided an alternative modality for evaluation of patients with aortic stenosis. By application of the modified Bernoulli equation, the pressure gradient across the stenotic aortic valve could be estimated by Doppler echocardiography. Though helpful and widely used, the information provided by the pressure gradient across the valve about the severity of the obstruction was not complete. The assessment of valvular aortic stenosis therefore includes an estimation of the valve area by application of the continuity equation. This review examines the maturation of the continuity equation by Doppler techniques and discusses the implications of the procedure. ",0
"Calcium channel blockers versus angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors: renal effects. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium channel blockers are two classes of antihypertensive agents with novel effects on renal function. In both experimental and clinical studies, calcium channel blockers tend to increase renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, and urinary sodium excretion in essential hypertension. ACE inhibitors have similar effects on renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate in essential hypertension, but they tend to cause sodium retention. ACE inhibitors can cause marked reductions in glomerular filtration rate in renovascular hypertension, making them a problematic choice for the treatment of this form of hypertension. In chronic, progressive renal diseases, ACE inhibitors have been shown to decrease protein excretion and morphologic evidence of glomerulosclerosis. The relationship of the decrease in protein excretion to the progression of renal disease has not yet been established. ",0
"Intraoperative dexamethasone irrigation in lumbar microdiskectomy. In 45 lumbar hemilaminectomy/microdiskectomy patients, a control group of 23 patients had the standard operative procedure. The remaining 22 patients were treated with intraoperative irrigation of long-acting dexamethasone before incision closure. Age, weight, gender ratio, mean postoperative hospital stay, mean in-hospital narcotics usage, and incidence of perioperative complications among the two groups were compared. Age and gender ratios were comparable, although the control group was significantly heavier in body weight than the steroid-irrigated group. The steroid-irrigated group had a significant reduction in hospitalization and a marked reduction in narcotics usage compared with the control group. Postoperative fever occurred in one patient in the steroid group. The control group had three postoperative complications. These preliminary observations suggest that dexamethasone irrigation during lumbar diskectomy is a safe and effective adjunct to surgical management. ",0
"Delayed facial nerve palsy after temporal lobectomy for epilepsy: report of four cases and discussion of possible mechanisms. Four cases of idiopathic peripheral facial nerve palsy were documented after 110 consecutive resections of the temporal lobe for intractable epilepsy. In 3 of the 4 cases, the palsy was ipsilateral to the side of the temporal lobectomy. The onset of facial weakness was delayed 7 to 13 days after surgery (mean, 9.7 days). One patient underwent facial electroneurography, which documented 17% of normal facial motor function at the height of his weakness and the absence of the acoustic stapedius reflex. All patients were treated with prednisone (60-80 mg per day by mouth for 10-14 days, tapering off throughout the subsequent week). Facial function recovered fully in all patients within 6 to 8 weeks. Possible mechanisms are discussed, including heat and/or mechanical trauma to the facial nerve near the geniculate ganglion during resection of mesial temporal lobe structures. ",0
"The role of infection in the morbidity and mortality of patients with head and neck cancer undergoing multimodality therapy. Cancer of the head and neck is a common cancer worldwide. The majority of patients present with locally advanced disease. Recently a great deal of improvement has been made in multimodality therapy of this disease, warranting more careful consideration of factors affecting quality of life, disease course, and treatment. Infection is clearly a factor. Analysis of 662 hospital admissions of 169 head and neck cancer patients was performed. A definite infection was documented in 86 febrile episodes, pneumonia contributed to 40%, bacteremia to 13%, skin and soft tissue infection to 12%, and tracheobronchitis to 10%. Among the evaluated risk factors, foreign bodies, specifically intravenous (IV) cannulae and gastrostomy tubes, race, performance status, alcohol intake, and nutritional status were statistically significant variables that predicted for or were associated with infection. Infection contributed to 44% of the deaths. ",0
"Surgery for sinusitis and aspirin triad. An 11-year retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the surgical treatment of sinusitis in aspirin-triad patients. Twenty-five patients were selected for surgery when their sinus disease and asthma progressed despite intense medical treatment. Sixteen patients had radiographic evidence of severe ethmoid disease, and their initial surgical procedures were limited (i.e., bilateral intranasal ethmoidectomies). Of these 16 patients, 6 required subsequent surgery for recurrent sinusitis. Nine of the 25 patients had radiographic evidence of severe antral, as well as ethmoid, disease. Their initial surgical procedures were radical, i.e., bilateral Caldwell-Luc operations with intranasal and transantral sphenoethmoidectomies. None of these 9 patients required further surgical treatment for control. This review indicates that if antral and sphenoid disease are detected in association with ethmoid involvement, a radical surgical approach is the operation of choice. ",0
"RAR-alpha gene rearrangements as a genetic marker for diagnosis and monitoring in acute promyelocytic leukemia. Acute promyelocytic leukemias (APLs) are characterized by a translocation that involves chromosomes 15 and 17. The translocation breakpoints have recently been identified and shown to involve the RAR-alpha gene on 17 and myl on 15. Here we report Southern blotting analysis of 26 APLs, including cases with normal karyotypes and atypical morphology, which showed RAR-alpha rearrangements in 92% cases, myl rearrangements in 73%, and either RAR-alpha or myl rearrangements in 100%. Despite a negative clinical and morphologic picture, DNA rearrangement analysis showed that neoplastic promyelocytes persisted in the bone marrow of two patients sampled after induction chemotherapy. Therefore, the RAR-alpha and myl rearrangements provide molecular markers for accurately diagnosing APLs and monitoring the course of the disease during and after chemotherapy. ",0
"Relationship of laparoscopic findings to self-report of pelvic pain. An assessment battery including standardized measures of behavioral and psychosocial factors associated with other chronic pain conditions was administered to 102 women scheduled for laparoscopic surgery. Surgeons who were blinded to the patient's self-reported pain data completed the American Fertility Society classification for endometriosis and adhesions on the basis of observed physical disease. Although American Fertility Society classification scores were significantly related to self-assignment into pain or no-pain groups, the extent of physical disease evaluated by this procedure was not significantly correlated with ratings of pain levels or a number of indexes of impairment. The group of patients with laparoscopically diagnosed pathologic conditions reported higher pain levels and greater interference than the group who reported pain and had negative laparoscopic results; however, some women with observable pathologic conditions reported no pain symptoms.

"Synergistic effects of psyllium in the dietary treatment of hypercholesterolemia. We investigated psyllium fiber supplementation as a means of enhancing the cholesterol-lowering effect of the phase I American Heart Association diet. Fifty-nine subjects with total serum cholesterol (TC) levels ranging from 5.56 to 10.24 mmol/L (215 to 396 mg/dL) were given a 2-month dietary lead-in followed by 3 months of diet only (29 subjects) or diet supplemented with 20.4 g of psyllium daily (30 subjects). Unlike women, men had a significant decrease in levels of both TC (-8.0%) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (-10.1%) during the dietary lead-in. Psyllium supplementation resulted in an additional 5.5% reduction in the TC levels as compared to diet alone. Psyllium supplementation combined with dietary lead-in resulted in an overall 17.3% decrease in the TC and a 20.0% decrease in LDL-C for men, with decreases of 7.7% and 11.6%, respectively, for women. Psyllium effectively enhances the cholesterol-lowering effect of the phase I diet. ",0
"Randomised single blind trial to compare the toxicity of subconjunctival gentamicin and cefuroxime in cataract surgery. Comparatively little attention has been paid to the conjunctival toxicity of antibiotics administered at the time of cataract surgery. We have observed the effect of subconjunctival gentamicin and cefuroxime injection, using colour photography in a randomised single blind trial of 121 patients undergoing routine cataract surgery. Our results suggest that a hyperaemic eye is likely to occur about twice as often in patients injected with gentamicin (p less than 0.001). Gentamicin is associated with more pain postoperatively (p less than 0.05). Significant manifestations of gentamicin toxicity are conjunctival oedema and capillary closure. Cefuroxime has some theoretical advantages over gentamicin in its antibacterial spectrum. ",0
"Extracapsular cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation after scleral buckling surgery. We reviewed the records of 28 patients who had undergone successful scleral buckling surgery followed by extracapsular cataract extraction with implantation of an intraocular lens. Posterior chamber intraocular lenses were inserted in 27 eyes, and anterior chamber intraocular lenses were inserted in two eyes with posterior capsule rupture at the time of surgery. The mean follow-up period was 44 months. Final visual acuity was 20/40 or better in 15 of 29 eyes (52%). One eye (3.4%) developed a recurrent retinal detachment 15 months after cataract surgery. Two eyes (6.9%) developed angiographically proven cystoid macular edema. The outcome for extracapsular cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation in eyes that had previously undergone successful scleral buckling for retinal detachment is favorable. ",0
"Effect of hydrocephalus on prostaglandins and thromboxane B2 in ventricular cerebrospinal fluid. The concentrations of prostaglandin F2 alpha, prostaglandin E2, 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha (prostacyclin metabolite), and thromboxane B2 were assayed in ventricular cerebrospinal fluid obtained from 28 patients with hydrocephalus (17 obstructive, 11 communicating). Seven patients received dexamethasone or hydrocortisone on the day of sampling. No patient received nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory compounds for 48 hours before sampling. The median values did not differ significantly between the two types of hydrocephalus or from the concentrations in lumbar cerebrospinal fluid obtained from patients without intracranial pathology during lumbar myelography for possible lumbar disc disease. Hence, there is no evidence that eicosanoids accumulate in the ventricles in hydrocephalus, and it is unlikely that they have a significant role in its symptomatology. ",0
"Effect of prednisolone treatment in chronic silicosis. We evaluated the effects of daily oral prednisolone therapy on alveolitis parameters and pulmonary function tests over a 6-month period in patients with chronic silicosis. Pulmonary function tests were done in 34 patients, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was done in 21 of them. Pulmonary function tests showed a significant improvement in lung volumes, FEV1, PEFR, SGaw, DLCO, and PaO2. Analysis of BAL fluid revealed a significant decrease in total cell count. Mean fibronectin and immunoglobulin values in BAL fluid also were lower after treatment, but the change was not statistically significant. No serious side effects were encountered with prednisolone therapy. These results indicate that daily oral prednisolone therapy may suppress the alveolitis in certain patients with chronic silicosis and bring about a significant improvement in lung functions and gas exchange.

"Total knee arthroplasty in obese patients. We examined 182 patients (257 knees) who had had a total knee arthroplasty two to five six years earlier. The patients were grouped into five weight classes. Eighteen patients (twenty-seven knees) were considered moderately obese and twelve patients (twenty-seven knees), severely obese. The results in all but four knees were rated excellent or good. One patient needed a revision procedure for late infection, and the result was rated poor. Three results were rated fair. There was no discernible difference in the over-all scores among the five weight groups. However, 30 per cent of the knees of the moderately and severely obese patients had patellofemoral symptoms, whereas the incidence was 14 per cent in the other groups (p less than 0.03). No clear-cut association was found between obesity and either thrombophlebitis or complications related to the wound. ",0
"Intravenous administration of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor causes a cutaneous eruption The intravenous administration of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor to three patients with leukemia who were receiving marrow aplasia-inducing chemotherapy resulted in the development of wide-spread erythematous macules and papules. The course of the eruption paralleled the time of infusion of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Skin biopsy specimens taken from two of the eruptions displayed characteristic changes consisting of a variable mixture of granulocytes and lymphocytes, increased number and size of dermal macrophages, mild to moderate epidermal exocytosis, intercellular edema, and rare dyskeratotic keratinocytes. Immunophenotypic analysis of one specimen was notable for keratinocyte intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression. Administration of the recombinant human cytokine in pharmacologic doses is postulated to induce changes in the immunologic status of the skin, resulting in the expression of a cutaneous eruption. ",0
"Evaluation of argon laser surgery in children under 13 years of age. Argon laser surgery is an effective treatment for ectasias and congenital port-wine stains; however, its use in children under the age of 13 is controversial. This paper reviews 202 children under the age of 13 who underwent argon laser treatments for congenital port-wine stains, spider angiomas, epidermal nevi, and lentigines. The clinical characteristics of port-wine stains in 170 children are discussed. Good to excellent results (moderate to complete clearing) in port-wine stains were obtained in 60 percent of patients and seemed to correlate best with lack of blanchability on pressure. Hypertrophic scarring was seen in only 7 children, all of whom had undressed wounds; no significant scarring has been seen in any subsequent child who had maintained a dressed wound postoperatively.

"Cholinergic deficiency and frontal dysfunction in Parkinson's disease. To investigate the influence of central cholinergic deficit on cognitive function in Parkinson's disease (PD), we compared the neuropsychological performance of a group of 20 patients who were treated with anticholinergic drugs (mean daily dose, 10.2 mg) with that of a group of 20 patients who received no anticholinergics. The two groups were matched for all the variables of parkinsonism and levodopa therapy. At the dose used, there was no significant difference between the two groups of patients for intellectual, visuospatial, instrumental, and memory function. In contrast, in the group that received anticholinergics severe impairment was observed on tests believed to assess frontal lobe function. These results suggest that the lesion of the ascending cholinergic neurons, which has been demonstrated post mortem in PD, may play a role in the subcorticofrontal behavioral impairment of this disease.

"Cerebrospinal fluid endothelin-1 and endothelin-3 levels in normal and neurosurgical patients: a clinical study and literature review. Endothelins are a family of structurally related, potent, long-lasting vasoconstrictor peptides. There are no established normal human levels of endothelin-1 or endothelin-3 in the cerebrospinal fluid. We measured cerebrospinal fluid endothelin-1 and endothelin-3 levels in five groups of patients: normal controls, patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral vasospasm, patients with severe head injuries, patients undergoing temporal lobectomy for intractable epilepsy, and a patient with a gunshot injury to the thoracic spine. Endothelin-3 levels were significantly elevated in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and may participate in cerebral vasospasm and subsequent neurologic deterioration. ",0
"The analysis of erythrocyte morphologic characteristics in urine using a hematologic flow cytometer and microscopic methods. Three methods for the examination of erythrocyte morphology in urine are described: phase contrast microscopy, microscopy of cytocentrifuged and stained preparations, and erythrocyte analysis with the Technicon H1. Analysis with the H1 has not been described until now. All methods can be used to discriminate between dysmorphic and isomorphic erythrocytes. The red cell distribution width was the best H1 parameter for this discrimination. The authors have found a good correlation between the microscopic methods. The clinical impact of the three methods was studied with urine samples from patients with a confirmed diagnosis. The discrimination between renal and nonrenal hematuria is similar with phase contrast microscopy and cytocentrifuged preparations. The use of the H1 for this discrimination is not recommended. ",0
"Cheilitis granulomatosa: report of six cases and review of the literature. Six cases of cheilitis granulomatosa, a rare inflammatory disorder of unknown origin, are reported. The condition produces nontender, persistent swelling of one or both lips and affects primarily young adults. Histologically, nonnecrotizing granulomatous inflammation is seen. The clinical findings and results of therapy in these six cases are presented. One patient was treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate (Plaquenil) that stabilized the process. One of our patients had vesicular-appearing lesions. Microscopic examination showed the lesions to be dilated superficial lymphatic channels, a finding that to our knowledge has not been previously described. ",0
"Alcoholic blackouts: legal implications. Alcoholic blackouts are defined as the temporary, complete inability to form long-term memory as the result of a high blood alcohol level. This means that a neuron-to-neuron system has been blocked. Since that is the case, such central nervous dysfunction should have legal implications, both from the blackout itself and also from the fact that this degree of neural interference in one system is at least suggestive that other dysfunction may be present. The subject of blackouts is updated with recent developments in neuroscience. The legal significance of the blackout is examined in enough depth to allow for further discussion and exploration. ",0
"Pneumonia due to Legionella micdadei in bone marrow transplant recipients. Legionella micdadei has previously been described as a cause of nosocomial pneumonia, particularly in kidney transplant recipients. Cell-mediated immunity is the principal host defense against this pathogen. A common clinical scenario in the immunocompromised host is that of septic pulmonary embolus, but asymptomatic infections have also been reported. The organism is weakly acid-fast in clinical specimens but loses this property when grown on solid media. We report two cases of L. micdadei pneumonia, differing markedly in clinical severity and outcome, in bone marrow transplant recipients. Additionally, we note the growth of the organism in liquid culture media with preservation of its acid-fast property. ",0
"Passive immunoprophylaxis after liver transplantation in HBsAg-positive patients. 110 HBsAg-positive patients underwent orthotopic liver transplantation and received long-term anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) passive immunoprophylaxis with anti-HBs immunoglobulin. During a mean follow-up period of 20 months, all patients became HBsAg negative after transplantation but circulating HBsAg reappeared in 25 (22.7%). Overall 1-year survival was 83.6% and overall 2 year actuarial recurrence of HBsAg was 29% (59% after posthepatitis B cirrhosis, 13% after posthepatitis B-delta cirrhosis, and 0% after fulminant hepatitis B). Patients with HBV cirrhosis who were HBV-DNA positive had a much greater risk of HBsAg recurrence than patients who were HBV-DNA negative (96% vs 29% at 2 years). Reappearance of HBsAg was associated with evidence of HBV replication and abnormal histological findings in the graft. Long-term passive anti-HBV immunoprophylaxis significantly reduced HBV reinfection and improved survival in patients without evidence of active HBV replication before orthotopic liver transplantation.

"Endoscopic management of postoperative biliary leaks: review of 77 cases and report of two cases with biloma formation. Biliary leaks are uncommon complications of abdominal surgery. Left untreated, they may result in significant morbidity and mortality. The traditional treatment has been surgical, but several authors have reported successful endoscopic management. We review 77 cases of endoscopically managed postoperative biliary leaks reported in the literature over the past 15 yr. Endoscopic treatment was technically successful in 95% of cases, and resulted in biliary leak healing in 82%. Cystic stump leaks had a better prognosis for healing compared with common bile duct or hepatic duct leaks. We also present two additional cases of postoperative biliary leaks with biloma formation successfully treated with endoscopic stent placement. Our experience lends additional support to endoscopic management as the preferred approach to postoperative biliary leaks. ",0
"Relevance of focal cerebral ischemia models. Experience with fibrinolytic agents. Despite the limitations of individual ischemia models, experience with fibrinolytic agents suggests that 1) early intervention with rt-PA may result in rapid thrombolysis, functional recovery, and decreased mortality in small animal stroke thromboembolism models, 2) rt-PA has no general effect on clinical recovery following MCA occlusion and reperfusion in the nonhuman primate at dose rates capable of producing very high circulating rt-PA levels, while u-PA has an apparently salutary effect, and 3) intravenous infusion of rt-PA or u-PA early after ischemia/infarction in several model systems is not associated with significant intracerebral hemorrhage. The true clinical relevance of these general impressions must await the completion of human studies and studies in well-conceived models designed to define the vascular consequences to be expected from reperfusion achievable with thrombolytic agents.

"Cystocerebral syndrome. Acute urinary retention presenting as confusion in elderly patients. The diagnosis of acute mental status changes in the elderly patient is often very difficult. Many causes are possible, and there is often little history obtainable. The physical examination occasionally provides the essential clues needed to discover the source of the sudden deterioration. We have recently evaluated four episodes of acute delirium in three elderly patients who presented with no readily apparent cause for these changes. On further evaluation, the patients were found to have marked bladder distention associated with acute urinary retention. None of these patients complained of discomfort, and none had any awareness or recollection of their deterioration. Each patient had rapid resolution of symptoms on bladder decompression. To our knowledge, this ""cystocerebral syndrome"" has not been previously described, and we suggest that it be considered in the evaluation of acute confusional states in elderly men. ",0
"Predictors of physician nonadherence to chemotherapy regimens. Physician nonadherence to cancer treatment regimens may diminish treatment efficacy and compromise clinical research. The influence of clinical, demographic, and psychosocial patient characteristics on physician adherence to breast cancer chemotherapy was investigated, as was the role of the clinician's attitudes concerning the chemotherapy. One hundred seven women recently diagnosed with breast cancer were followed for 26 weeks of treatment. Fifty-six (52%) of the patients experienced unjustified modification for at least one chemotherapeutic agent. Stepwise multiple regression revealed independent contributions of increased patient age, treatment setting (clinic versus academic or community private practice), and stage of disease to physician nonadherence. Regimen complexity, delay in seeking treatment, and presence of psychiatric disorder did not contribute, in general, to unjustified regimen modifications. Patient psychological and psychiatric factors, however, did influence prescribing behavior for vincristine. Physician awareness of factors contributing to unnecessary treatment modifications may reduce the frequency of such behaviors. ",0
"Vitamin E in gastric mucosal injury induced by ischemia-reperfusion. To clarify the relationship among vitamin E, oxygen radicals, and lipid peroxidation in ischemia-reperfusion, we produced an experimental model of gastric mucosal injury in rats by ischemia-reperfusion with clamping of the celiac artery and measurements of the area of gastric erosion, thiobarbituric acid (TBA)-reactive substances, and alpha-tocopherol in serum and gastric mucosa during ischemia-reperfusion. The area of gastric erosions and TBA-reactive substances in gastric mucosa were significantly increased after 30 and 60 min of reperfusion. The serum alpha-tocopherol-cholesterol ratio and gastric mucosal alpha-tocopherol were significantly decreased after 30 and 60 min of reperfusion. On the other hand, in vitamin E-deficient rats, gastric mucosal injury induced by ischemia-reperfusion was more severe than that in vitamin E-nondeficient rats. These results indicate that vitamin E is consumed in the process of lipid peroxidation induced by oxygen radicals in ischemia-reperfusion to prevent the development of tissue damage. ",0
"Physical features of Prader-Willi syndrome in neonates. A retrospective study of 16 patients was undertaken to identify physical features that may typify neonates with Prader-Willi syndrome. Several features known to be typical of Prader-Willi syndrome in early infancy were confirmed, including hypotonia and genital hypoplasia. A number of features that have not previously been emphasized as characterizing Prader-Willi syndrome were also identified, most notably abnormal cry and, in males, signs of genital hypoplasia but with an apparently normal phallus. Other features included disproportionately large head circumference, disproportionately large anterior fontanelle, mild micrognathia, mild anomalies of the gingivae or alveolar ridges, and changes in the appearance of the skin. Appreciation of these features may assist the pediatrician in recognizing the child with Prader-Willi syndrome during the neonatal period, before the appearance of better-known findings of later onset, such as obesity and acromicria.

"Congenital angiotropic lymphoma (intravascular lymphomatosis) of the T-cell type. The autopsy of a stillborn infant showed an extensive intravascular proliferation of atypical cells throughout the body. There was no infiltration by these cells of the parenchyma of the bone marrow, lymph nodes, or thymus. By histochemistry, these cells were negative for naphthol-ASD-chloroacetate esterase, a marker of granulocytes. By immunohistochemistry, they were reactive with MT-1 and anti-Leu-22, but unreactive with MB-1, L26, anti-Leu-M1, Tu-9, and antihemoglobin antibodies. A few cells reacted with antileukocyte common antigen and UCHL-1. Based on these findings, the lesion was diagnosed as angiotropic lymphoma (intravascular lymphomatosis) of the T-cell type, which occurred congenitally. Most angiotropic lymphomas in the literature are of the B-cell type, and no leukemia virus type I antibody was negative in the mother. ",0
"Treatment of ventricular tachycardia induced cardiogenic shock by percoronary chemical ablation. Incessant ventricular arrhythmias pose an especially challenging therapeutic dilemma. We describe the successful treatment and follow-up of a patient with refractory ventricular tachycardia-induced cardiogenic shock with percoronary chemical ablation. After endocardial mapping was used to identify the ""tachycardia-related"" coronary artery, temporary termination of the arrhythmia with balloon occlusion and subselective intracoronary installation of iced saline as previously advocated was unsuccessful. This was probably due to a dual arterial blood supply to the arrhythmogenic focus. However, infusion of 2 cc ethanol (99%) permanently terminated the arrhythmia. Contrary to previous experience, ethanol-induced arrhythmia termination did not result in arterial occlusion, further supporting a direct toxic effect on the myocardium as its mode of action. Use of standard angioplasty balloon inflation prevents ""backwash"" of distally infused ethanol and more generalized cell death. The only complication of this procedure was temporary third-degree AV block, requiring permanent pacemaker implantation. ",0
"Cardiotoxicity of interferon. A review of 44 cases. Cardiovascular complications have occurred in clinical trials of interferon. We review herein experience to date of cardiotoxicity with all types of interferons in cancer patients. The most common presentations of cardiotoxicity were cardiac arrhythmia, dilated cardiomyopathy, and symptoms of ischemic heart disease, including myocardial infarction and sudden death. The cardiac effects were not related to the daily dose, cumulative total dose, or period of therapy. Some of the patients in whom interferon has caused cardiovascular sequelae have had a history of coronary heart disease or have previously been given chemotherapy with drugs known to be cardiotoxic. In most of the patients, cardiac toxicity was reversible following the cessation of the drug therapy. ",0
"A randomized study of methanol-extraction residue of bacille Calmette-Guerin as postsurgical adjuvant therapy of uveal melanoma. A randomized controlled clinical trial of methanol-extracted residue of bacille Calmette-Guerin adjuvant treatment of posterior uveal melanoma was undertaken. Of 113 patients, 34 patients received adjuvant immunotherapy and 79 patients received no treatment. No difference in survival was observed between the adjuvant-treated group and the control group of patients. This study found that the size of the tumor was a highly significant risk factor for death caused by metastasis of uveal melanomas. The standard deviation of the nucleolar area of the neoplastic cells was a significant risk factor, even though patients with tumors composed of Callender's spindle-type cells were not included in the study.

"Correction of subclavian artery stenosis by percutaneous angioplasty. Subclavian artery stenosis is an infrequently recognized cause of left-sided chest and arm pain that can mimic the signs and symptoms of angina pectoris. In addition, more proximal subclavian artery stenoses can be associated with cerebrovascular symptoms in the ""subclavian steal syndrome."" This article reviews the clinical experience in four patients who presented with different manifestations of subclavian artery stenosis and who were all successfully treated by percutaneous angioplasty. Their clinical presentation, angiographic findings, and post-angioplasty results are documented. In conclusion, it is felt that nonsurgical correction of critical subclavian artery stenosis, using current angioplasty techniques, is the preferred method of treatment. ",0
"Angioplasty of occluded coronary arteries: use of thin shaft balloon over-the-wire system without pre-dilatation. A retrospective review was done on 13 consecutive patients who underwent PTCA of totally occluded coronary arteries using a recently released thin shaft balloon over-the-wire angioplasty system. Balloon size was determined by the closest fit to the arterial size and used without predilatation techniques. This technique was initially successful in 12 patients with only 2 clinically insignificant episodes of distal embolization and one probable early reclosure. Using thin shaft angioplasty systems, balloon dilatation of totally occluded coronary arteries can be done safely with a single balloon in many cases resulting in simplified procedures and economic benefits.

"The role of infection in the morbidity and mortality of patients with head and neck cancer undergoing multimodality therapy. Cancer of the head and neck is a common cancer worldwide. The majority of patients present with locally advanced disease. Recently a great deal of improvement has been made in multimodality therapy of this disease, warranting more careful consideration of factors affecting quality of life, disease course, and treatment. Infection is clearly a factor. Analysis of 662 hospital admissions of 169 head and neck cancer patients was performed. A definite infection was documented in 86 febrile episodes, pneumonia contributed to 40%, bacteremia to 13%, skin and soft tissue infection to 12%, and tracheobronchitis to 10%. Among the evaluated risk factors, foreign bodies, specifically intravenous (IV) cannulae and gastrostomy tubes, race, performance status, alcohol intake, and nutritional status were statistically significant variables that predicted for or were associated with infection. Infection contributed to 44% of the deaths. ",0
"The epidemiology of cancer among Hispanic women. The experience in Florida. To explore cancer incidence among Hispanic women living in Dade County, Florida, data were analyzed from the statewide cancer registry. For all but three sites, Hispanics had lower rates of the 15 most prevalent cancers than non-Hispanics. However, higher rates of cancer among Hispanics were noted for cancers of the gallbladder, liver, and heart and soft tissue. Subgroups of women had significantly higher rates of cervical cancer and thyroid cancer. Lower rates among Hispanics were observed for cancers of the esophagus, vagina, breast, colon, buccal cavity and pharynx, and malignant melanoma. These data suggest that most cancer sites traditionally higher among US Latino women were not higher among Dade Hispanics, and that sites more common among non-Hispanics have not yet shown an increased incidence among Hispanic women in Dade County.

"Senile dementia and healthy aging: a longitudinal CT study. Volumetric indexes of cerebral atrophy obtained by using computed tomography (CT) were measured longitudinally in patients with senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT) and in healthy elderly control subjects. Measurements were made three times over a 51-month period. Of the original 44 patients with SDAT, five were available for CT examination at the last time of assessment (51 months); in contrast, 41 of the original 58 control subjects were still available for study at 51 months. As a group, scans of SDAT subjects showed greater atrophy than those of control subjects in all volumetric indexes at each time of testing and demonstrated greater progression of atrophy during the study period. However, the overlap of indexes between the patients with SDAT and the control subjects indicates that CT data cannot be used alone to predict the presence or progression of dementia in individual cases.

"Hemodynamic effects of lobar pulmonary artery occlusion in a porcine sepsis model. We induced severe pulmonary hypertension and acute lung injury in 6 pigs by Pseudomonas aeruginosa infusion. We studied the effect of pulmonary artery catheter inflation of a pulmonary artery catheter balloon in the left lower lobar pulmonary artery was accompanied by a significant (p less than 0.05, paired t test) increase in pulmonary artery pressure, a decrease in left atrial pressure, a decrease in cardiac output, and a decrease in mean arterial pressure. No significant changes occurred when the catheter was advanced into the wedged position without balloon inflation. Balloon inflation had no significant effect on these variables before bacterial infusion. We conclude that with sufficiently severe pulmonary hypertension in association with diffuse lung injury, lobar pulmonary artery occlusion may cause alterations in cardiac output and left atrial pressure. This may confuse interpretation of pulmonary artery catheter measurements. ",0
"Prolonged confusion following convulsions due to generalized nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Among patients with a prolonged confusional state after convulsive seizure, we diagnosed 8 cases as generalized nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Six had a history of seizures, and 2 had new onset. The convulsive seizures were generalized in 6 and focal in two. The postictal confusion lasted up to 36 hours in the most prolonged case, and a delayed response to anticonvulsant medications occurred in all cases. The clinical symptoms ranged from mild confusion to coma. Psychiatric manifestations or automatisms were rare. The presumed etiology was due to diverse causes, but a withdrawal state was the most common. EEG demonstrated continuous or nearly continuous generalized ictal discharges of variable morphology. These cases call attention to the fact that some prolonged confusional states following convulsive seizures are in fact due to persistent seizure activity that can be diagnosed by EEG. ",0
"Flow cytometric determination of breast tumor heterogeneity. Flow cytometric analysis was done on the DNA content of nuclei obtained from different sites of small breast tumors. Although specimens for analysis were obtained within a few millimeters of each other, dramatic differences were occasionally observed in the DNA histograms. In a limited study involving 141 consecutive breast specimens submitted for flow cytometry, 52% (74) were found to have at least one DNA aneuploid population. In 18% of DNA aneuploid tumors, one or more specimens from areas grossly identified as tumor had no DNA aneuploid population. Because of the proposed correlation of aneuploidy with a poorer prognosis and possible responsiveness to chemotherapy, multiple sites should be assayed when flow cytometric DNA analysis is done. ",0
"Protective role of vitamin E in biological systems. Vitamin E is well accepted as nature's most effective lipid-soluble, chain-breaking antioxidant, protecting cell membranes from peroxidative damage. Free-radical-mediated pathology has been implicated in the development over time of degenerative diseases and conditions. This paper reviews the current research on the protective role and requirements for vitamin E and the other antioxidants in preventing or minimizing free-radical damage associated with specific diseases and lifestyle patterns and processes, including cancer, aging, circulatory conditions, arthritis, cataract, pollution, and strenuous exercise. While awaiting results of further human studies, research evidence suggests that an adequate intake of vitamin E and the other antioxidants can provide protection from the increasingly high free-radical concentrations caused by air pollutants and current lifestyle patterns.

"Primary care patients who refuse specialized mental health services. The charts of 65 patients who completed mental health care referrals were compared with those of 65 patients who failed to complete such referrals. In the year before referral, the noncompliant patients made 37% more medical visits than the compliant patients. As compared with the compliant patients, a significantly greater proportion of the noncompliant patients' medical visits were for difficult-to-explain somatic symptoms. Mental health referrals from some physicians were much more successful than referrals from other physicians. By attending to their patients' pattern of health care utilization, primary care physicians may be able to identify patients at high risk for noncompliance with mental health referrals. ",0
"The natural history of non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy. Seventy one patients with non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy were studied retrospectively. Sixty three (89%) were followed to the end of the study or death, mean follow up time was 5.3 years. Whilst twenty (28%) had diabetes or hypertension, in thirty nine (55%) no predisposing condition was identified. In those who had monocular disease at presentation (68), subsequent involvement of the second eye occurred in seventeen (25%), seven within the first year. Nineteen patients died within the study period. Of these, nine died from myocardial infarction and four from cerebrovascular disease. This is a significant increase above figures calculated from the Office of Population Census and Surveys (p less than 0.001 for all causes, p less than 0.002 for myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular disease). Such an increase in mortality has not been previously reported, and implies that this condition carries a more sinister systemic prognosis than is frequently supposed. ",0
"The opposite pupil in herniation. I serially examined the pupil opposite the one already enlarged from transtentorial herniation in 13 patients. The main abnormalities, stereotyped in most patients, were an initially diminished light reaction with a 2.5- to 4-mm-diameter pupil, followed by slight reduction in size, and then reenlargement to greater than original size, all with preserved roundness. Subsequent deterioration varied among patients, but a transitional oval shape was infrequent and oculomotor function was preserved until both pupils were enlarged and fixed. Once the pupil on the side of a mass enlarges, heralding herniation, subsequent deterioration can be appreciated through changes in reactivity and size of the opposite pupil. ",0
"Upper gastrointestinal bleeding in relation to previous use of analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Catalan Countries Study on Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding To assess the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding associated with the use of individual non-narcotic analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), a multicentre study of 875 cases of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and 2682 hospital controls was done. With control for confounding factors, the overall odds ratio estimate for aspirin taken at least once during the week before the first symptom was 7.2 (95% confidence interval 5.4-9.6). Non-aspirin NSAIDs associated with upper gastrointestinal bleeding were diclofenac (7.9 [4.3-14.6]), indomethacin (4.9 [2.0-12.2]), naproxen (6.5 [2.2-19.6]), and piroxicam (19.1 [8.2-44.3]). Paracetamol, propyphenazone, and dipyrone did not increase the risk. A previous history of gastrointestinal bleeding or peptic ulcer did not greatly affect odds ratio estimates, which differed according to sex and were higher for younger than for older patients. However, the incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding was higher among the elderly. ",0
"Mixed connective tissue disease with arterial thrombosis, antiphospholipid antibodies and heparin induced thrombocytopenia. We report a patient with mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) who presented with thrombosis of the right femoral artery in association with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). When treated surgically and with heparin prophylaxis, she developed heparin induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis which necessitated amputation of a lower limb. Thus our patient developed 2 separate groups of autoantibodies associated with thrombotic events. Our case highlights an association between thrombosis, aPL and MCTD. Furthermore, it emphasizes a need for intensive monitoring when hypercoaguable individuals with connective tissue disorders are treated with heparin. ",0
"Superficial esophageal carcinoma. Surgical treatment and the results. We report 92 patients treated with esophagectomy for superficial esophageal carcinoma (SEC; 9.1% of all resected esophageal cancers at our institution). The operative mortality rate was 5.4%. In 24 cases, cancer invasion was limited to the mucosa, and in 68 to the submucosa. Twenty-three patients in the former group had no lymph node involvement, whereas 24 patients (35.3%) of the latter group had lymph node metastases. The 5-year survival rate after surgery for patients with SEC limited to the mucosa was 83.5%, which was significantly better than that for carcinoma invading the submucosa (54.9%). No recurrent disease occurred in patients with lesions limited to the mucosa. In conclusion, an esophagectomy with wide lymphadenectomy is necessary to provide a better prognosis for SEC invading the submucosa, whereas a less extensive treatment may be considered for SEC limited to the mucosa.

"The recalcitrant perineal wound after rectal extirpation. Applications of muscle flap closure. Perineal wounds developing after abdominoperineal resection result in chronic purulent drainage and intermittent episodes of sepsis and are generally unresponsive to conservative medical and surgical treatment. Thirteen consecutive patients (aged 27 to 74 years; mean, 48 years) who underwent debridement and immediate muscle flap closure of these wounds were analyzed to identify risk factors for delayed healing and to evaluate the effectiveness of muscle flap coverage. Three risk factors were identified: preoperative or postoperative radiation therapy, resection for recurrent carcinoma, and inflammatory bowel disease. A total of 19 muscle flaps (11 gracilis, five gluteal thigh, two gluteus maximus, and one rectus abdominis) were used to close these wounds. During an average 3.5-year follow-up, four (31%) minor complications and one (8%) recurrence were noted to occur. Muscle flaps provide safe, effective, single-stage procedures for the closure of chronic perineal wounds. ",0
Prostate specific antigen for assessing response to ketoconazole and prednisone in patients with hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer. Serial prostate specific antigen levels were assessed in 15 patients with hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer treated with ketoconazole and prednisone. Of the men 12 (80%) with continually increasing prostate specific antigen levels before treatment had a decrease in prostate specific antigen with a median duration of response of 3 months. Three patients (20%) had a prolonged response (greater than or equal to 8 months) as seen by a persistently decreasing prostate specific antigen and improvement in bone pain. There appears to be a small subgroup of patients with progressive prostate cancer despite androgen ablation who will benefit from ketoconazole and glucocorticoid treatment. The use of serial prostate specific antigen levels appears to help define this subgroup and avoid the need for multiple radiological procedures to assess response. ,0
"Intravascular ultrasound: a new potential modality for angioplasty guidance. Current angioplasty devices are limited by significant rates of arterial perforation and dissection, due to inadequate techniques of guidance, and by restenosis, which may be partly attributed to inadequate debulking of lesions. This paper describes the authors' initial experience in-vitro and in-vivo with intravascular ultrasound as a possible method of enhancing the three-dimensional guidance of devices through atherosclerotic obstructions. Using an in-vitro model they correlated the dimensions and histologic morphology of animal and human arteries with ultrasound images of the specimens. Additional in-vivo evaluations of this technology in canine arteriosclerotic and human atherosclerotic arteries preliminarily support the hypothesis that intravascular ultrasound defines the transmural arterial morphology and may enhance the accuracy of angioplasty procedures. Simultaneous imaging with angioscopy and intravascular ultrasound is demonstrated as a potential method of accurately defining both intraluminal and transmural arterial wall characteristics. ",0
"Tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesions of the head and neck. The term 'tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesion' has been used to describe a fibrosclerosing disorder which has a locally destructive nature but is characterized by a benign histological appearance. We report five patients, over a five year period, with such a lesion. The clinical behaviour and surgical findings suggest the lesion to be an invasive malignancy. However, the histological appearance of an admixture of chronic inflammatory cells and fibrosis is consistent with a benign condition. We recommend surgical excision of the lesion as the mainstay of treatment; other studies report the use of steroids and radiotherapy. ",0
"Reversal of cardiac dysfunction secondary to type 1 primary hyperoxaluria after combined liver-kidney transplantation. A 23-year-old man with type 1 primary hyperoxaluria, renal failure, and oxalosis developed a severe cardiomyopathy while awaiting combined liver-kidney transplantation. This manifested as radiographic cardiomegaly, a dilated hypokinetic left ventricle with a decreased ejection fraction, ventricular arrhythmias, and cardiac uptake on bone scanning. On liver and kidney transplantation, these abnormalities markedly improved and/or reversed. The cardiac size almost normalized, the left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 20% to 34%, the ventricular arrhythmias resolved, and the cardiac uptake on bone scanning disappeared. This coincided with normalization of oxalate production and excretion. Severe cardiac involvement secondary to oxalosis in patients with primary hyperoxaluria may improve or reverse with combined liver-kidney transplantation. ",0
"Unsuspected syphilitic hepatitis in a patient with low-grade proteinuria and abnormal liver function A 25-year-old patient was found to have cholestatic liver enzyme abnormalities during assessment for asymptomatic low-grade proteinuria at the US Naval Hospital in Portsmouth, Virginia. These abnormalities persisted for a 6-month period, and an extensive workup, including viral serologic studies, rapid plasma reagin test, iron studies, ceruloplasmin, antimitochondrial, antinuclear, and anti-human immunodeficiency virus antibodies, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and liver biopsy, was unrevealing until serologic tests for syphilis were repeated to evaluate a new onset of urethral discharge. The patient had none of the more characteristic signs of secondary syphilis. The liver enzyme abnormalities rapidly resolved after treatment with penicillin. Syphilis remains the great impostor and still must be considered in the differential diagnosis of unexplained liver enzyme abnormalities, even in a patient with no symptoms or signs of early syphilis.

"Percutaneous balloon dilatation of benign biliary strictures. Percutaneous biliary dilatation is an effective alternative to surgical management of benign biliary strictures that has low morbidity and no reported mortality. Reported success rates for this procedure range from 40% to 90% depending on the size of the series, the type of patient being treated, and the length of follow-up period. The procedure is done in the fluoroscopy suite with an angioplasty balloon catheter. Transhepatic access is most common, but the procedure may be done via existing T-tube tracts or specially created jejunal loops. As the frequency of radical liver surgery such as liver transplant and radical trisegmentectomy rises, so too, the rate of biliary stricture is likely to rise, making percutaneous balloon dilatation an increasingly important tool in the interventional radiologist's armamentarium.

"Results of transsphenoidal extirpation of craniopharyngiomas and Rathke's cysts. Fourteen patients undergoing transsphenoidal extirpation of craniopharyngiomas or Rathke's cysts underwent endocrinological evaluation before and after surgery. One patient died during the procedure because of uncontrollable arterial bleeding. The other patients were followed for up to 16 years (average, 8.5 years). One patient had recurrence of tumor 12 years after surgery. Another patient, the only one operated on because of a recurrent craniopharyngioma after previous radiation therapy, died 2 years after the transsphenoidal operation. No patient recovered pituitary functions that had been lost before surgery. One patient, who had an isolated growth hormone deficiency, and another, who had panhypopituitarism with sustained antidiuretic hormone secretion, had no change postoperatively from their preoperative endocrine status. The other 11 patients lost pituitary function and required pharmacological replacement of one to four pituitary hormones. ",0
"Pearson's marrow-pancreas syndrome. A multisystem mitochondrial disorder in infancy. Pearson's marrow-pancreas syndrome (McKusick No. 26056) is a fatal disorder of hitherto unknown etiology involving the hematopoietic system, exocrine pancreas, liver, and kidneys. The observation of high lactate/pyruvate molar ratios in plasma and abnormal oxidative phosphorylation in lymphocytes led us to postulate that Pearson's syndrome belongs to the group of mitochondrial cytopathies. Since rearrangements of the mitochondrial genome between direct DNA repeats were consistently found in all tissues tested, our results show that this disease is in fact a multisystem mitochondrial disorder, as suggested by the clinical course of the patients. Based on these observations, we would suggest giving consideration to the hypothesis of a defect of oxidative phosphorylation in elucidating the origin of other syndromes, especially those associated with an abnormal oxidoreduction status in plasma.

"Retinal arterial macroaneurysms: risk factors and natural history. A case control study was conducted to identify the systemic and ocular risk factors for retinal arterial macroaneurysms. Forty-three patients with 52 photographically confirmed macroaneurysms were located. Forty-three age-matched, race-matched concurrent control patients were also identified. The patients with macroaneurysms had decreased visual acuity (p less than 0.0001) and a higher prevalence of hypertension (p = 0.037), female sex (p = 0.099), and retinal vein occlusions (p = 0.055) than controls. In patients with both a macroaneurysm and venous occlusion there was a 12.0 times higher prevalence of macroaneurysms in the area of retina drained by the occluded vein (p less than 0.05). Common findings associated with macroaneurysms included retinal haemorrhage (81% of patients), retinal exudate (70%), vitreous haemorrhage (30%), macular involvement (30%), and distal arteriolar narrowing (26%). Arteriolar occlusion occurred spontaneously (8%) or after laser photocoagulation (16%). ",0
"Mechanical restraint use among residents of skilled nursing facilities. Prevalence, patterns, and predictors The patterns of and risk factors for mechanical restraint use were determined in 12 skilled nursing facilities. Restraints were being used for 59% of residents at the beginning of the study; 31% of remaining residents were restrained during the follow-up year. No facility characteristic was associated with restraint use. The resident characteristics independently associated with initiation of restraints were older age, disorientation, dependence in dressing, greater participation in social activities, and nonuse of antidepressants. Unsteadiness (72%), disruptive behavior such as agitation (41%), and wandering (20%) were the most frequently cited reasons for initiation of restraints. ",0
"Computed tomography for evaluation of puerperal infections. Pelvic computed tomography was used to evaluate 74 women with persistent puerperal infection. There was at least one abnormal roentgenographic finding in 57, and these are correlated with clinical and surgical findings. In 16 women, a palpable pelvic mass was seen on tomography, however, masses not appreciated clinically were visualized in another 29 women, and in five, a clinically palpable mass was not visualized by tomography. In 12 women who had a normal pelvic examination, septic pelvic thrombophlebitis was diagnosed by tomography. Over-all, there was poor correlation with roentgenographic findings and uterine incisional necrosis and dehiscence. We conclude that pelvic tomography is useful to evaluate some women with persistent puerperal infection, but that these studies must be correlated with clinical findings. ",0
"Central nervous system involvement in patients with facial palsy due to borrelial infection. Patients with a peripheral facial palsy due to an underlying Ixodes-borne borreliosis often have cerebrospinal fluid findings indicating meningeal involvement. The aim of the present study was to identify signs of CNS involvement by means of brain-stem evoked response audiometry (BSER) in patients with a facial palsy due to borreliosis, as well as in patients with a facial palsy of unknown aetiology. Bell's palsy. Abnormalities in BSER were found to be significantly more common along the borrelial patients. Furthermore, a reversal of these abnormalities following treatment with benzyl-penicillin was found in the majority of patients with borreliosis. The results of the present study emphasize the importance of diagnosing and treating an underlying borreliosis in patients with a peripheral facial palsy. ",0
"Driving in Parkinson's disease. Altered motor or mental skills in Parkinson's disease (PD) could adversely affect driving ability. We interviewed 150 patients regarding their driving habits and compared them with 100 controls. Thirty patients had stopped driving because of PD. PD patients had no more lifetime accidents than controls. With increased disability, however, there was a smaller percentage of patients still driving with fewer miles traveled and with proportionately more accidents occurring. Though disability scores did not correlate well with driving ability, there were significantly more accidents in subjects with more severe PD. The presence of cognitive impairment was associated with an increased accident rate. We conclude that driving in PD may be a public health problem and that some PD patients should not drive. ",0
"Standard v lightweight wheelchair propulsion in spinal cord injured patients. Twenty-six male SCI subjects (six quadriplegics, eight ""high paraplegics,"" and 12 ""low paraplegics"") propelled both standard and lightweight wheelchairs at a ""sprint pace"" (Sp) for 400 feet, and at a ""duration pace"" (Du) for four continuous minutes. Pulse, blood pressure and respirations were measured before and after each trial, and V was calculated. Appropriate training and rest periods were given; order of wheelchair testing was randomized. A questionnaire was later administered. Variations in pulse, systolic blood pressure, and respirations were significant between myelopathic levels (P less than 0.01), but were not affected by the type of wheelchair used. Quadriplegic V was less (P less than 0.01) than that of either paraplegic group for Sp and Du trials; for Sp, lightweight wheelchair V is faster (P less than 0.01) than standard wheelchair V for all groups.

"Comparative yield of Salmonella typhi from blood and bone marrow cultures in patients with fever of unknown origin. Over three years, a comparative study on 100 selected patients with fever of unknown origin was undertaken to determine the yield of Salmonella typhi from their blood and bone marrow cultures. The results indicate that in patients who had an infection with S typhi the organism was isolated from the bone marrow in all of them and from the blood in only 66%. This suggests that bone marrow cultures may be attempted when blood cultures are negative for bacterial growth after three to four days of incubation. ",0
"Systemic hypertension in sleep apnea syndrome. Relationship with sleep architecture and breathing abnormalities. To examine the possible relationship between systemic HT and SAS we compared 21 hypertensive (HT+) and 29 normotensive (HT-) patients for morphologic characteristics, sleep disturbances and respiratory events monitored during a full night polysomnography. There was no significant difference between HT+ and HT- patients with respect to age, weight, BMI, sleep stage distribution and disorganization, apnea-hypopnea index (number of episodes per hour of sleep) and duration (minutes per hour of sleep) nor O2 saturation indices: mean nocturnal and minimum O2 saturation. We conclude therefore that HT in SAS patients is not directly related to morphologic characteristics, sleep disturbances and breathing abnormalities. ",0
"Measurement of resistance versus flow in assessing efficiency of aortocoronary bypass grafts. Measurement of flow in saphenous bypass grafts with an electromagnetic flowmeter is complicated and poorly reproducible. Since coronary flow is largely dependent on variable factors the stable value of resistance seems more appropriate for comparison. A simple method has been developed for intraoperative measurement of resistance in the respective coronary bed. Pressure is recorded in the saphenous graft by an electromanometer during continuous flushing with known amounts of blood, and resistance is calculated instantaneously. The procedure is very simple and takes less than one minute. The quality of the saphenous vein itself can be assessed simultaneously by the same method. Resistances were measured during coronary surgery in over 500 saphenous grafts. The results were highly reproducible and comparable. Excellent flows can be expected if resistance is below 200 Peripheral Resistance Units (PRU); if this is over 800 PRU flow is very poor. ",0
"Changes in physician practice for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. To determine recent changes in physicians' practices for cardiovascular disease risk reduction, a randomly selected sample of practicing primary care physicians in the upper Midwest was interviewed by telephone in 1987 and again in 1989 (response rates, greater than 90%; N = 241). The reported mean cutoff levels for labeling a total serum cholesterol level as abnormal dropped from 5.84 to 5.43 mmol/L (226 to 210 mg/dL) and for initiating medication, from 7.34 to 6.54 mmol/L (284 to 253 mg/dL). The proportion of physicians using diuretics as preferred step 1 antihypertensive agents dropped from 60% to 32%. Preferences became evenly divided among diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and beta-blockers. Advice about physical exercise changed little, but consensus among practicing physicians was high. Substantial improvements were found in smoking cessation activities. Practicing physicians are proving to be responsive to new scientific evidence and education in the prevention of cardiovascular disease. ",0
"Orbital compartment syndrome. Direct measurement of orbital tissue pressure: 1. Technique. Many disorders of the orbit produce an increase in intraorbital pressure, which may result in the development of an orbital compartment syndrome and visual loss. Traditionally, orbital tension is assessed clinically by indirect means based on retrodisplacement of the globe. The authors describe their experience with the ""slit-catheter"" technique for direct tissue pressure measurement as applied to the orbit. The preliminary results indicate that normal orbital pressure ranges from 3.0 to 6.0 mm Hg. In patients with Graves' orbitopathy the values ranged from 7.0 to 15.0 mm Hg. The results suggest that the technique may have many exciting possibilities as a clinical research tool in orbital disease, and its use will result in better understanding of orbital compartment syndromes.

"The neuromuscular pathology of the Eosinophilia-Myalgia syndrome. The Eosinophilia-Myalgia Syndrome (EMS) is a recently reorganized disorder in patients ingesting pharmacologic doses of L-tryptophan. We studied the lesions of skeletal muscle, peripheral nerve and skin in 12 cases of EMS. Perimyositis was severe in four, moderate in two, mild in three and absent in three cases. The lesions contained many eosinophils, T-helper cells, mast cells and activated macrophages. Type 2 myofiber atrophy was present in five cases and in one, this was the only pathologic finding. Severe epineurial inflammation was seen in the three sural nerve biopsies. Indirect evidence for peripheral neurologic involvement in three other cases consisted of inflammation surrounding intramuscular nerve twigs (two cases) and neurogenic atrophy (one case). Phlebitis accompanied the connective tissue inflammation in five cases and endarteritis in one. Fasciitis was present in three of four skin biopsies and dermal fibrosis in one. ",0
"Survival rates from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: recommendations for uniform definitions and data to report. Survival rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest vary widely among locations. We surveyed the definitions used in published studies of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Data from 74 studies involving 36 communities showed survival rates ranging from 2% to 44%. There were five different case definitions and 11 different definitions of survivors. The absence of uniform definitions prevents meaningful intersystem comparisons, prohibits explorations of hypotheses about effective interventions, and interferes with the efforts of quality assurance. The most satisfactory numerator for a survival rate appears to be survival to hospital discharge; the most appropriate denominator appears to be witnessed adult cardiac arrest of presumed heart disease etiology, with ventricular fibrillation as the initial identified rhythm. Proposed definitions for the data emergency medical services systems should report as they examine their cardiac arrest survival rates are presented. ",0
"Delayed death from aortic root trauma. A 40-year-old man suffered blunt chest trauma, had a myocardial infarct 58 days later, and died unexpectedly 19 days after that. Autopsy showed partial avulsion of a small branch of the right coronary artery with thrombus extending into the right coronary sinus of Valsalva occluding the right coronary artery and causing a myocardial infarct. Death was caused by a thromboembolus arising from the aortic root thrombus and occluding the left main coronary artery. The case is unusual in that the major consequences of the aortic root trauma were delayed, and death resulted from occlusion of both coronary arteries. ",0
"Acute epididymitis: why patient and consort must be investigated. In this prospective study of 49 patients under 35 years of age with clinically diagnosed epididymitis, detailed microbiological investigation identified an infective cause in 67%. Chlamydia trachomatis was the commonest agent, present in 25 patients, but in 12 of these detection was based solely on raised antibody titres; 20 of the 28 female consorts screened were partners of men with chlamydial epididymitis and 80% of them were also positive for this infection. Isolating the micro-organism from 14 of 16 consorts indicated active infection despite the negative swabs from the men. If this important infection is to be adequately treated we recommend that all patients in this age group with epididymitis and their partners should be referred to a specialist unit with access to full chlamydia laboratory facilities.

"Mucosal characteristics of pelvic ileal pouches. This study aimed to investigate the degree of colonic metaplasia in ileo - anal pouches. Biopsy specimens from 25 patients with functioning pouches, eight of whom had pouchitis, were studied using routine histology, mucosal morphometry, mucin histochemistry, and immunoperoxidase staining with monoclonal antibodies directed towards a 40kD colonic protein and a small bowel specific disaccharidase-sucrase isomaltase. Thirteen patients (including all eight with pouchitis) had subtotal or total villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia. In this group, nine had colorectal type sulphomucin and the 40kD colonic protein was detected in two. These changes were not observed in patients with less severe villous abnormalities. Sucrase-isomaltase activity was, however, present in all 25 pouch specimens. We conclude that although some ileal pouches acquire certain colonic characteristics, complete colonic metaplasia does not occur. ",0
"Diabetic retinopathy in blacks. Diabetic eye disease, particularly diabetic retinopathy, is the leading cause of new cases of legal blindness in people 20-74 yr of age in the United States. The prevalence and rate of diabetes in this age-group are higher in Blacks than in Whites. The rate of blindness from diabetic eye disease is also higher in Blacks than in Whites. Severe macular edema, the most frequent cause of decreased vision in diabetic retinopathy, appears to be more common in Blacks. Risk factors for developing macular edema include poorly controlled hypertension, hyperglycemia, and duration of disease. The higher prevalence of hypertension in Blacks may contribute to the increased severity of diabetic retinopathy. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the influence of race on the severity of diabetic retinopathy. ",0
"Microdochectomy for discharge from a single lactiferous duct. Microdochectomy for persistent discharge from a single lactiferous duct was performed in 162 women. Invasive or in situ ductal carcinoma was diagnosed in 16 patients (10 per cent), none of whom had a palpable lump. The discharge was blood-stained in 14 of these women and in two it was clear. Mammography was performed in 15 of these 16 patients and was abnormal in only five. Three patients had atypical ductal hyperplasia, one of whom subsequently developed an invasive ductal carcinoma. Microdochectomy for persistent discharge from a single lactiferous duct is curative and gives a diagnosis of the cause. It remains the treatment of choice whether the discharge is blood-stained or clear. ",0
"1990 AcroMed Award in basic science. Cauda equina anatomy. II: Extrathecal nerve roots and dorsal root ganglia. Inconsistent data exist regarding the anatomy of the spinal nerve roots lateral to the thecal sac. A newly developed in situ technique was used to precisely define anatomic parameters on 20 fresh human cadavers. The take-off angle of the nerve roots from the thecal sac decreases from a mean of approximately 40 degrees from L1-L5 to 22 degrees at S1. The motor bundles are directly ventral to the sensory fibers within individual roots extrathecally. Dorsal root ganglia size varies with vertebral level. The majority of ganglia lie directly beneath the vertebral pedicles and one third overlie a portion of the lateral intervertebral disc. These previously undescribed relationships may aid in the understanding of lumbosacral neurocompressive disorders and are important to note during pedicle screw insertion, posterolateral decompression for spinal trauma, and paravertebral approaches for lateral disc herniations.

"Retrospective application of prognostic indices to pancreatitis discovered at necropsy. Six prognostic indices, which were developed to assess inpatients with acute pancreatitis, were evaluated for possible retrospective application. When applied to a series of 14 cases in whom pancreatitis was first diagnosed at necropsy, the index devised by Jacobs et al was found to be the most useful, because in nine of these cases eight or more of the variables required were available for assessment from the case records. In the other indices evaluated fewer than eight of the required variables were available for retrospective assessment in most cases. Although undiagnosed pancreatitis is probably uncommon as a sole cause of death, the retrospective use of one or more of these indices may help assess the severity of the patient's condition on admission to hospital.

"Ultrastructural changes in impotent penile tissue: a comparison of 65 patients. To determine whether impotence is caused by specific and consistent changes in erectile tissue, we compared the ultrastructure of the corpora cavernosa in 6 controls with that in 59 patients undergoing implantation of a penile prosthesis. The impotent patients were divided into groups based on a medical history of hypertension (10), pelvic surgery (9), alcoholic smokers (8), hypertensive alcoholics (3), hypertensive alcoholic smokers (3), smokers (3), diabetics (8), diabetic smokers (3), Peyronie's disease (3), spinal cord injury (3) and isolated causes (6). Our data demonstrate that different behavioral and/or medical conditions produce similar degenerative tissue responses. There is no single or specific cause of impotence that is manifest by consistent changes in erectile tissue. ",0
"Transitional cell carcinomatous meningitis after M-VAC (methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin) chemotherapy. The M-VAC (methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin) regimen has been utilized at our two institutions to treat 17 patients with advanced stage transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. We report 2 cases of carcinomatous meningitis resulting from metastatic transitional cell carcinoma which occurred in patients treated with M-VAC. Review of the literature suggests that our experience with central nervous system metastases is not unique, and that treatment of advanced stage transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder with M-VAC may enhance the incidence of meningeal metastases. Carcinomatous meningitis, although rare, is a rapidly fatal manifestation of metastatic transitional cell carcinoma if left untreated. However, prompt diagnosis and early aggressive therapy may result in palliation and stabilization of neurologic status. We review the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of transitional cell carcinomatous meningitis. ",0
"Safe use of codeine in the recovering alcoholic or addict. The effect that codeine has on the process of addiction and recovery is unclear. Confusion about definitions, study endpoints, and a lack of well-controlled clinical studies has led to this uncertainty. Codeine addiction is uncommon in people who do not have existing vulnerability to addiction, including alcoholism. Codeine use can sustain addiction or increase the risk of relapse in patients afflicted with addiction. The risk of relapse must be considered when treating conditions such as pain or cough in a person recovering from addiction. Codeine use may be circumvented with the appropriate use of alternative treatments for pain or cough. If codeine use becomes necessary, cautious prescribing and reliance on the patient's recovery support network become imperative. ",0
"Surgical complications with the cochlear multiple-channel intracochlear implant: experience at Hannover and Melbourne. The surgical complications for the first 153 multiple-channel cochlear implant operations carried out at the Medizinische Hochschule in Hannover and the first 100 operations at the University of Melbourne Clinic, The Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital, are presented. In the Hannover experience the major complications were wound breakdown, wound infection, electrode tie erosion through the external auditory canal, electrode slippage, a persistent increase in tinnitus, and facial nerve stimulation. The incidence of wound breakdown requiring removal of the package was 0.6% in Hannover and 1.0% in Melbourne. The complications for the operation at both clinics were at acceptable levels. It was considered that wound breakdown requiring implant removal could be kept to a minimum by making a generous incision and suturing the flap without tension. ",0
"Incidence and survival rates of children and young adults with osteogenic sarcoma. Gender-specific and race-specific incidence and survival rates of osteogenic sarcoma over a 14-year period are presented for persons aged 0 to 24 years from eight Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries. They were no significant gender or racial differences in age at diagnosis. There was no significant gender difference in overall incidence. Although incidence rates were slightly higher in blacks compared with whites, the difference was not significant after controlling for multiple comparisons. Females (median, 74 months) survived longer than males (median, 29 months), although this difference weakened after controlling for stage. No racial differences in survival were observed. White females survived the longest (median, 94 months), followed by black females (median, 41 months), black males (median, 34 months), and white males (median, 29 months). This striking difference in survival should be explored more fully. ",0
"Racial differences in the anterior circulation in cerebrovascular disease. How much can be explained by risk factors? The entry characteristics of 1367 patients enrolled into the Extracranial/Intracranial Bypass Study were examined to determine if site differences in intracranial and extracranial arterial lesions among racial groups could be explained by differences in risk factors. Blacks were more often hypertensive, diabetic, or cigarette smokers, while whites had higher systolic blood pressure and hemoglobin values. Orientals had the lowest prevalence of vascular risk factors. Despite these differences in risk factors, multivariate analysis showed race to be an independent and strong predictor of the location of cerebrovascular lesions. To our knowledge, this study is unique in documenting risk factors prospectively and systematically in three racial groups simultaneously. Although generalization is limited by possible biases related to patient selection, the results affirm previous tentative conclusions about the role of race in determining the location of cerebrovascular disease.

"Dysplasia and DNA aneuploidy in a pelvic pouch. Report of a case. A patient with an 18-year history of ulcerative colitis was operated on with colectomy, mucosal proctectomy, ileoanal anastomosis, and an S-type pelvic pouch due to intractable chronic continuous disease. The patient was followed by endoscopic controls and biopsy sampling from the pouch at regular intervals. A gradual development of severe atrophy in the ileal mucosa was followed by the development of low grade dysplasia. At the most recent endoscopic control, 4 years after the construction of the pouch, biopsies were sampled also for flow cytometric DNA analyses. DNA aneuploidy was detected in a biopsy from the center of the pouch, and a biopsy taken immediately adjacent showed low grade dysplasia. These findings underline the importance of endoscopic follow-up after construction of a pelvic pouch and focus attention to the potential of malignant transformation of the mucosa. ",0
"Survival after hypertonic saline resuscitation from hemorrhage. There has been recent increased interest in hypertonic saline resuscitation from shock and hemorrhage. This study was performed to evaluate the survival effects of hypertonic saline resuscitation. Fifty male Sprague-Dawley rats of average weight of 325 grams were anesthetized with halothane. Animals were subjected to blood loss of 21 ml/kg over 5 minutes. Intravenous infusion was started 10 minutes after hemorrhage with either lactated Ringer's injection (42 ml/kg) or three per cent NaCl (10.64 ml/kg) chosen randomly. These doses provided equal amounts of sodium. At the end of fluid infusion, blood samples were obtained for electrolyte determination. Rats were observed 3 days for survival. Survival was significantly lower in the three per cent NaCl group compared with the lactated Ringer's group. It is probable that worsened outcome with three per cent NaCl was associated with intracellular dehydration. ",0
"The cellular composition of basal cell adenoma of the parotid gland: an immunohistochemical analysis. Four cases of basal cell adenoma of the parotid gland were examined immunohistochemically to characterize their cellular composition. In all cases epithelial membrane antigen and keratin were detected in the inner luminal cells; some cells also showed positive staining for secretory functional markers, indicating their differentiation toward secretory epithelium. In tubular and trabecular types the outer cells consistently displayed an intense staining for vimentin and some were also positive for actin, indicating their myoepithelial nature. In the solid type, most tumor cells resembled the ductal cells or basal cells of larger ducts in normal gland with regard to their immunoreactivity. Our results may suggest that the proportion and arrangement of heterogeneous tumor cells are responsible for different histologic patterns of the salivary basal cell adenoma. ",0
"Mammographic measurements before and after augmentation mammaplasty. Thirty-five augmented women underwent mammography using both the standard implant-compression technique and, when possible, the implant-displacement technique; all had preaugmentation film-screen mammography available for evaluation. The area of mammographically visualized breast tissue before and after augmentation mammaplasty was measured using a transparent grid. Patients with subglandular implants had a mean decrease of 49 percent of measurable tissue area with compression mammography and a 39 percent decrease with displacement mammography. Patients with submuscular implants had a 28 percent decrease in measurable tissue area with compression mammography and a 9 percent decrease with displacement mammography. Anterior breast tissue was seen better with displacement mammography; posterior breast tissue, with compression mammography. Most patients had some degree of parenchymal scarring and lower image quality after augmentation. State-of-the-art mammography was not possible in most patients augmented with silicone-gel-filled implants. ",0
"Postoperative hypertension: a prospective, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind trial, with intravenous nicardipine hydrochloride. Nicardipine hydrochloride, a new calcium channel blocker for intravenous use, has been compared with placebo in a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial on postoperative hypertension. Of 175 patients who signed preoperative consent, 24 (13.7%) met entry criteria. Hypertension was significantly better controlled in nicardipine-treated patients compared with those receiving placebo (93% versus 30%, p less than 0.05). All the placebo failures were subsequently successfully treated with nicardipine. There were no significant complications in either group. The authors conclude that nicardipine HC1 is an effective, safe therapy for postoperative hypertension. Further studies are now indicated comparing it with other drugs currently used to treat this condition. ",0
"Two-dimensional echocardiographic features of double outlet left ventricle. In a cyanotic newborn infant, the diagnosis of double outlet left ventricle was made from the two-dimensional echocardiographic examination. The diagnosis was later confirmed at cardiac catheterization and surgery. The parasternal and subcostal views were especially useful for identification of the origin of both great arteries from the morphologic left ventricle. A review of the medical literature since 1967 revealed 77 cases of double outlet left ventricle, most of which were diagnosed only at surgery or postmortem examination. The anatomic features demonstrated with two-dimensional echocardiography in this case are representative of the findings cited most often in the cases reported in the medical literature. ",0
"Cholecystectomy and right colon cancer in Puerto Rico. A case-control study was undertaken to evaluate the possible relationship between cholecystectomy and right colon cancer. Two hundred patients with adenocarcinoma of the cecum or ascending colon (diagnosed between 1984 and 1989) were compared with 200 matched neighborhood controls. Cholecystectomy history was obtained through interviews using structured questionnaires and subsequently validated from hospital records. A statistically significant association (odds ratio = 2.14) was found between right colon cancer and a history of prior cholecystectomy. The altered bile metabolism which occurs after removal of the gallbladder may have a carcinogenic effect on the right colon. Dietary habits of the colon cancer patients in our study were consistent with prior reports in the literature, showing that this group has a lower intake of vegetables and cereal fiber than the control population.

"Late cholangitis after successful surgical repair of biliary atresia. Bacterial cholangitis is a frequent complication of successful surgical repair of biliary atresia, occurring in 93% of patients before the age of 1 year, but thought to be rare after 2 years of age. Among 76 children free of jaundice more than 5 years after operation, four presented with late cholangitis (7 to 13.5 years old), consisting of fever, jaundice, and abdominal pain with biochemical features of an inflammatory process and cholestasis. Liver biopsy specimens consistently demonstrated histological features of cholangitis, growth of microorganism, or both. Cholangitis subsided spontaneously in one patient or in response to intravenous administration of antibiotics. Cholangiography consistently demonstrated biliary abnormalities but no definite obstruction to the bilioenteric anastomosis. All the children had good hepatic function 3 weeks to 4 years after the episode of cholangitis. These results suggest that cholangitis may occur several years after surgery but does not seem to alter prognosis. ",0
"Hyperplastic polyps seen at sigmoidoscopy are markers for additional adenomas seen at colonoscopy. Asymptomatic individuals undergoing screening flexible sigmoidoscopy were prospectively studied. Polyps were found in 185 subjects. The endoscopist recorded an opinion on the polyps' histology based on endoscopic appearance. No polyps were removed at sigmoidoscopy. All subjects with rectosigmoid polyps then underwent colonoscopy and polypectomy. Of them, 99 subjects (54%) had at least one rectosigmoid adenoma, 69 (37%) had only hyperplastic polyps, and 17 (9%) had other findings. The endoscopists' opinion of the histopathology of polyps at sigmoidoscopy was correct for 61% of the lesions. Of subjects with adenomatous rectosigmoid polyps, 29% had additional adenomas at more proximal sites. Proximal adenomas were found in 28% of patients with hyperplastic rectosigmoid polyps. Patients with rectosigmoid hyperplastic polyps had the same risk for additional proximal adenomas as patients with rectosigmoid adenomatous polyps. ",0
"Interventional radiology of the biliary tract. Transcholecystic intervention. Diagnostic and therapeutic biliary intervention by percutaneous access to the gallbladder is an important new area in interventional radiology. The anatomy of the gallbladder, biliary tree, and surrounding viscera is reviewed in this article as a preliminary to discussion of the diagnostic techniques of aspiration, cholangiography, biopsy, and the therapeutic techniques of gallbladder drainage and cholelithotomy. Recently there has been a bewildering proliferation of procedures aimed at removal, fragmentation, and dissolution of gallbladder stones. Several of these are discussed in this article. Removal of common bile duct stones by percutaneous cholecystostomy also is discussed. ",0
"Does age affect outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation? We examined the relation between age and outcomes in patients treated for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Seattle, Wash. Considering all out-of-hospital cardiac arrests treated by paramedics over a recent 5-year period, 386 (27%) of 1405 consecutive patients aged 70 years or older were resuscitated and admitted to a hospital vs 474 (29%) of 1624 younger patients; 140 elderly patients (10%) were discharged alive vs 223 younger patients (14%). Of the 140 elderly patients, 112 went home and 28 went to a nursing home. Considering only patients whose initial rhythms were ventricular fibrillation, the percent of patients discharged alive was substantially higher: 120 (24%) of 493 for elderly patients and 194 (30%) of 639 for younger patients. Elderly patients can benefit from attempted resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. ",0
"Increased microvascular permeability in vivo in response to intradermal injection of neutrophil-activating protein (NAP-2) in rabbit skin. Neutrophil-activating protein-2 (NAP-2), an NH2-terminally processed form of the platelet-release product beta thromboglobulin (beta TG), was purified to homogeneity from stimulated human blood leukocytes. In the presence of a vasodilator substance (PGE2, CGRP) picomolar (pmol/l) amounts of NAP-2 induced neutrophil accumulation and plasma leakage on intradermal injection in rabbit skin, whereas the longer forms, beta TG itself and connective tissue-activating peptide III (CTAP-III), had no such effect. NAP-2-induced increased in microvascular permeability was neutrophil dependent and fast in onset, with a half-life of 65 to 75 minutes, comparable to that previously reported for the structural-related neutrophil-activating protein-1/interleukin-8 (NAP-1/IL-8). However NAP-2 showed a lower potency in that more protein was needed to provoke skin reactivity. Nevertheless the finding that a platelet release product can elicit neutrophil-mediated inflammation further narrows the gap between thrombotic events and inflammatory disorders. ",0
"Beta-carotene's effects on serum lipoproteins and immunologic indices in humans. Doses of beta-carotene for cancer-prevention trials have been chosen based on epidemiologic data. Mechanisms of the putative antineoplastic effects by beta-carotene are unknown but may involve modulation of the immune system. We measured plasma carotenoid concentrations and selected immunologic indices at baseline and at 2 and 4 wk in 50 healthy humans (5 groups of 10 each) ingesting 0, 15, 45, 180, or 300 mg beta-carotene/d for 1 mo in this randomized placebo-controlled, open-label, parallel study. Plasma beta-carotene concentrations were markedly increased by 2 wk and were correlated with dose. Beta-carotene concentrations plateaued between 2 and 4 wk except for the 300-mg group. Thus, we developed a dose-concentration curve to optimize beta-carotene-dose selection to achieve target plasma concentrations. We were unable to identify any effects of beta-carotene ingestion on the immunologic indices studied, but modest increases in high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol were observed in all beta-carotene-treated groups.

"Pulmonary malakoplakia in a patient with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Differential diagnostic considerations. Malakoplakia is an unusual inflammatory condition characterized histopathologically by accumulations of benign macrophages, or von Hansemann's cells, that are associated with diagnostic intracellular and extracellular calcospherites, termed Michaelis-Gutmann bodies. Currently believed to represent an acquired defect of macrophage digestion, malakoplakia most commonly occurs in the urinary tract and is associated with a variety of infectious agents, notably gram-negative bacilli. We describe a patient with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome who presented with a cavitating lingular mass. A transbronchial biopsy specimen revealed pulmonary malakoplakia, the seventh reported case of this condition and the second reported occurrence of pulmonary malakoplakia in a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Microbiological cultures were positive for Rhodococcus equi. The significance of this finding, and the differential diagnosis of intra-alveolar histiocytic proliferations in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, is discussed. ",0
"Rigid spine syndrome with respiratory failure. The pathogenesis and therapy of respiratory failure in the rigid spine syndrome are discussed in two cases who improved with respiratory assistance. In both cases, the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide were reversed in arterial blood gas analysis and %VC was less than 30%. Remission from respiratory failure has been obtained by the use of a ventilator during the night. The cause of the respiratory failure in both cases was severe restrictive respiratory dysfunction due to extreme flattening of the chest and fixation of the thorax during respiration as a result of contracture of costovertebral joints. All the previously reported cases of the rigid spine syndrome with respiratory failure died. Appropriate use of the ventilator can improve the prognosis. ",0
"Use of plasmid profiles in the investigation of a patient with Helicobacter pylori infection and peptic ulcer disease. Plasmids may effect bacterial virulence and antibiotic resistance, and serve as epidemiologic markers. In this study, plasmid DNA profiles of serial isolates of Helicobacter pylori showed persistence of an identical strain of this organism in a patient with duodenal ulcer disease. Three control strains of H. pylori isolated from other patients contained plasmids different from each other and from that of the original patient; two of these strains had two plasmids each. These data have important implications for further study of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of H. pylori-related diseases. ",0
"Microspectrophotometric DNA analysis in ulcerative colitis with special reference to its application in diagnosis of carcinoma and dysplasia. The deoxyribonucleic (DNA) content was measured by microspectrophotometry in 100 specimens from 60 patients with ulcerative colitis, including six patients in whom the colitis was associated with carcinoma. Some 23 of 30 (77%) specimens of dysplastic tissue showed aneuploidy or polyploidy, whereas 50 of 53 (94%) specimens of non-dysplastic tissue showed diploidy. The difference was statistically significant (p less than 0.001). Polyploidy was often observed in non-dysplastic mucosa from patients who had carcinoma or dysplasia. In the non-dysplastic patients all samples of inflamed tissue showed diploidy. Some 10% of samples without inflammation, however, also showed polyploidy. A good correlation was found between the frequency of polyploid cells and the grade of dysplasia. Microspectrophotometric measurement of DNA content proved useful in the assessment and diagnosis of dysplasia in ulcerative colitis and could be considered for screening high risk patients. ",0
"Limitation of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization using iodized oil for small hepatocellular carcinoma. A study in resected cases. The radiologic and histologic findings are presented of the resection of 14 small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC), less than 2 cm in maximum diameter, after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TCE) using iodized oil. The effect of TCE on small HCC depended on the morphologic type of the tumors. When no extracapsular invasion of tumor cells occurred, TCE was extremely effective against encapsulated tumors. However, in nine of the 14 resected specimens, viable tumor cells remained in or around the tumor. The authors suggest that small HCC are not always curable with TCE alone and that a multi-disciplinary approach is necessary for patients with small HCC. ",0
"Long-term results of the Belsey Mark IV antireflux operation in relation to the severity of esophagitis A retrospective analysis of the results of the Belsey Mark IV operation has been conducted, relating these to the degree of esophagitis present preoperatively. Analysis of 89 patients showed a 91.7% success rate in patients without esophagitis. Good results diminished steadily as the severity of esophagitis increased, giving 76.5%, 75%, 66.7%, and 50% success rates for first-, second-, third-, and fourth-degree esophagitis, respectively. We believe that shortening of the esophagus is an important factor in this. Shortening is obvious in third- and fourth-degree esophagitis but subtle in first- and second-degree esophagitis. We conclude that the Belsey operation is adequate for patients without esophagitis, but for patients with any degree of esophagitis more effective reflux control is needed. ",0
"Expression of HLA-DR and secretory component antigens and lymphocyte infiltration in human gastric nonmalignant and malignant tissues: an immunohistochemical study. The relation between HLA-DR and secretory component (SC) expression and the degree of lymphocyte infiltration was immunohistochemically examined in human gastric mucosa with or without intestinal metaplasia and gastric carcinoma tissues. Gastric mucosa without obvious inflammation showed neither expression of HLA-DR or SC nor remarkable lymphoid infiltration. In contrast, gastric mucosa with chronic inflammation, tissues with incomplete type of intestinal metaplasia, and carcinoma demonstrated both HLA-DR and SC in almost the same area and also prominent lymphoid infiltration in the surrounding stroma. This simultaneous expression of HLA-DR and SC was not observed in complete type of intestinal metaplasia. The results indicate a close relationship between expression of HLA-DR and SC and the presence of lymphocyte infiltration in gastric mucosa, areas of incomplete type of intestinal metaplasia and in gastric carcinomas.

"Elevated serum tumor markers in patients with testicular cancer after induction chemotherapy due to a reservoir of markers in cystic differentiated mature teratoma. Elevated serum tumor markers in patients with testicular cancer after induction chemotherapy indicate in most instances the presence of residual malignant disease. We describe 2 patients with elevated tumor markers after chemotherapy and before retroperitoneal lymph node dissection who did not prove to have residual malignant disease but cystic differentiated mature teratoma with a high content of alpha-fetoprotein and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin, respectively, in the cysts. It is postulated that leakage of the contents of these cysts to the plasma compartment was responsible for maintaining elevated serum tumor marker levels. Recognition of such entities is of consequence since unnecessary salvage chemotherapy in these patients may be avoided. ",0
"Repetitive conservative surgery for recurrence of endometriosis. We evaluated the recovery of fertility and the relief of pain symptoms in a long-term follow-up of 42 women undergoing repetitive conservative surgery for recurrent endometriosis. The mean age of the patients was 31.1 +/- 4.3 years. At the time of their second operation the disease was stage IV in 14 women, stage III in 25, and stage I in three. After reoperation, the patients were followed for a mean period of 41.8 +/- 30.3 months. Pain symptoms returned in eight women, dysmenorrhea and deep dyspareunia in eight, and pelvic pain in seven. Eight of the 28 women (28.6%) who attempted to conceive achieved a total of 13 pregnancies. The corrected pregnancy rate was 35%, and the cumulative rate at 27 months was 30.7%. A third operation was necessary in six women after a mean period of 35 months. Conservative surgery is an effective therapeutic option for infertile patients with recurrent endometriosis. ",0
"Human atherosclerotic coronary artery xenografts: a model for investigation of transluminal recanalization. A model for testing transluminal recanalization techniques was developed. Fragments of human atherosclerotic coronary arteries were transplanted into carotid arteries of dogs and evaluated by angiographic, angioscopic, and histologic study within a three-month period. An inflammatory response was most intense within the first week. By two weeks no inflammation was noted. Total occlusion (n = 13) and stenosis (n = 11) of the carotid arteries were achieved without complications. The model is easy to produce within a short period and the arterial occlusion resembles human vascular disease. This model has been used to evaluate laser recanalization of vascular obstructions. ",0
"Cervical screening with cervicography and the Papanicolaou smear in women with genital condylomata. Cervicography has been shown to be a very sensitive screening tool in the general population. Its value in screening a high-risk population was explored. One hundred five women seen with vulvar condylomata or a history thereof were offered a cervigram and Papanicolaou smear. Twelve patients had abnormal smears, whereas 53 had abnormal cervigrams. Colposcopically directed biopsies in the abnormal Papanicolaou group revealed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) I in six patients and III in two. Cervicography-positive patients exhibited CIN I in 9 cases, II in 1 and III in 2. There was some overlap. Twelve patients had cervical condylomata without dysplasia. Cervicography, in addition to cervical cytology, should be considered for all women with vulvar condylomata. ",0
"Surgical treatment of low rectovaginal fistulas. Forty women with low rectovaginal fistulas were operated upon over a 9-year period. The etiology of the fistula in the majority was obstetric. Nine women had prior attempts to repair the fistula. All 40 women were managed with endorectal advancement flap with the addition of sphincteroplasty or perineal body reconstruction in 15 patients and rectocele repair in six patients. Postoperative complications included urinary difficulties (two patients) and wound complications (three patients). There were two recurrences. All women treated with sphincteroplasty or perineal body reconstruction were continent. Seven women complained of varying degrees of incontinence postoperatively; none had undergone sphincter or perineal body reconstruction. Endorectal advancement flap is a safe and effective operation for women with rectovaginal fistulas. Concomitant sphincteroplasty or perineal body reconstruction should be performed in women with historical, physical, or manometric evidence of incontinence. ",0
"Contiguous enlarged dental follicles with histologic features resembling the WHO type of odontogenic fibroma Defective odontogenesis and/or retarded eruption of teeth can be associated with histologic features akin to odontogenic fibroma in the dental follicles. Unerupted mandibular premolar and molar teeth of a 24-year-old man were surgically exposed, yet the teeth failed to erupt. About a year and a half later, radiographs indicated further enlargement of the follicle of the premolar, and both teeth were subsequently surgically removed. Histologically, the follicles were composed of mature collagenous tissue among which epithelial islands and numerous clusters of calcified bodies were present. Indirect immunofluorescence showed positive staining for type I and type III collagen, which exhibited a sparse distribution, but not for the aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen. The hamartomatous nature of the lesions is discussed with emphasis on their histologic resemblance to the WHO type of odontogenic fibroma. ",0
"Selenium in forage crops and cancer mortality in U.S. counties. The potential protective effect of selenium status on the risk of developing cancer has been examined in animal and epidemiologic studies. This ecological study investigated the association between U.S. county forage selenium status and site- and sex-specific county cancer mortality rates (1950-1969) using weighted least squares regression. Consistent, significant (p less than .01) inverse associations were observed for cancers of the lung, rectum, bladder, esophagus, and cervix in a model limited to rural counties and for cancers of the lung, breast, rectum, bladder, esophagus, and corpus uteri in a model of all counties. No consistent significant positive associations were observed in the rural county models. This remarkable degree of consistency for the inverse associations strengthens the likelihood of a causal relationship between low selenium status and an increased risk of cancer mortality. ",0
"Abnormal epidermal changes after argon laser treatment. A 26-year-old woman with a congenital port-wine stain on the forehead was treated three times at 2-month intervals with an argon laser. Six months after the last treatment, moderate blanching and mild scaling confined to the treated area was observed. A biopsy specimen of the treated area revealed a significant decrease in ectatic vessels. However, epidermal changes similar to those of actinic keratosis with disorganized cell layers and marked cytologic abnormalities were seen. Analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes for a defect in DNA repair was negative. Multiple, argon laser-induced photothermal effects may be responsible for the changes observed in our case and may lead to premalignant epidermal transformation. ",0
"An angiographic technique for three-dimensional determination of arterial supply patterns in cadaver soft tissue. A method for arterial tree mapping that can be used in cadaver soft tissue is presented. In situ angiograms and photographs are supplemented with profile angiograms of relatively narrow bands of tissue from the removed specimen. The described method was better suited for mapping the course and supply patterns of a soft-tissue arterial network than either in situ angiograms or dissection. While practical problems were encountered with most of the solutions used for providing radiopacity or structural support to the vessels, pure barium sulfate was found to be suitable because it filled the vascular tree to the capillary level without leakage during excision of the specimen.

"Prolonged paralysis following suxamethonium and the use of neostigmine. A case of prolonged neuromuscular block following the administration of suxamethonium is reported. Three hours after administration of suxamethonium, a well defined, recovering phase II block was demonstrated with a T4:T1 ratio of 0.25, and neostigmine was administered. Although the T4:T1 ratio was improved to 0.9, T1 remained at 25% of control, and significant paralysis persisted which responded to administration of cholinesterase. It is concluded that neuromuscular monitoring cannot reliably predict reversibility in such cases and that, even after 3 h, antagonism of prolonged suxamethonium block should commence with cholinesterase, followed by neostigmine if necessary.

"Rectal mucosal dysplasia in Crohn's disease. Serial sections of 812 rectal biopsy specimens from 356 Crohn's disease patients were analysed for mucosal epithelial dysplasia. Dysplasia was found in 18 patients (5%), with four showing dysplasia on repeat biopsy specimen. In these 22 biopsy specimens the dysplasia was mild in 13, moderate in nine, and severe in none. Subsequently, three patients (17%) developed neoplasms including carcinoma in two and an adenomatous polyp in one. In colectomy specimens which showed dysplasia, significantly more dysplastic changes were found in seven patients who underwent colonic resection than in 10 others who underwent operation but had no prior dysplasia (p less than 0.001). Thirteen patients still have their rectum in situ and remain at risk of developing colonic cancer. Four carcinomas developed in patients with Crohn's disease who did not have dysplasia on rectal biopsy specimen. ",0
"Synergism of herpes simplex virus and tobacco-specific N'-nitrosamines in cell transformation. Previous studies indicate that herpes simplex virus (HSV) enhances the carcinogenic activity of smokeless tobacco and tobacco-related chemical carcinogens in animals. Since tobacco-specific N'-nitrosamines (TSNAs) such as N'-nitrosonornicotine (NNN) and 4-(N-methyl-N'-nitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) are major chemical carcinogens of smokeless tobacco and are known to be responsible for the development of oral cancers in smokeless tobacco users, the combined effects of TSNAs and HSV in cell transformation were investigated. Exposure of cells to NNN or NNK followed by virus infection resulted in a significant enhancement of transformation frequency when compared with that observed with chemical carcinogens or virus alone. This study suggests that TSNAs and HSV can interact together and show synergism in cell transformation. ",0
"Corpus callosotomy for intractable seizures in the pediatric age group. The results of corpus callosotomy in 18 patients 16 years old and younger are presented. Eighty-three percent of our patients have had a significant improvement from the surgery (a decrease in seizure frequency of greater than 80% or no longer having generalized atonic, tonic, or tonic-clonic seizures). The procedure seems to be well tolerated in young patients, and we have not noted a postoperative deterioration in behavior, memory, or language function in our patients. One of our patients died in status epilepticus 3 months after surgery. Nevertheless, we have not encountered any serious morbidity in our other patients. Corpus callosotomy can be considered for children with intractable seizures, especially when generalized atonic, tonic, or tonic-clonic (whether primary or secondary) seizures are the major seizure type.

"Low incidence of asymptomatic brain metastases in patients with renal cell carcinoma. Brain metastases from renal cell carcinoma are uncommon. The present study was undertaken to determine the value of routine computerized tomographic (CT) scanning of the brain in patients with renal cell carcinoma. A review of 106 patients with renal cell carcinoma who had undergone CT scan of the brain revealed brain metastases in only 13.2 percent. Brain metastases were accompanied by central nervous system (CNS) symptoms in 78.6 percent of patients, with headaches constituting the most common presenting symptom (64.3%). Brain metastases were detected in only 3.3 percent of patients who had no CNS symptoms at the time of evaluation. It is concluded that CT scanning of the brain should be performed routinely only for those patients who report CNS symptoms at the time of evaluation. ",0
"The use of ultrasound in evaluating neurologic diseases of childhood. Real-time cranial sonography, intracranial Doppler, and neuromuscular sonography are the sonographic techniques that are applicable to the neurologic evaluation of infants and children. Although limited by age, specificity, and operator skill and experience, the advantages of real-time cranial and intracranial Doppler sonography make them useful techniques in the evaluation of the young infant, particularly in the serial assessment of ventricular size and in the study of the critically ill infant. The use of neuromuscular sonography in the assessment of the floppy infant and in the guidance of biopsy makes this an increasingly valuable tool. ",0
"Expandable biliary metal stents for malignancies: endoscopic insertion and diathermic cleaning for tumor ingrowth. Seventeen patients with malignant biliary strictures have been treated by endoscopic insertion of self-expandable metallic prostheses. Two patients received two prostheses inserted simultaneously in both the left and right hepatic ducts for Klatskin tumor type III. Immediate results were satisfactory despite an operative mortality of 18%, and neither early nor late clogging was observed even in patients who presented previously with sludge above plastic stents that were removed. However, among five patients followed for more than 4 months, two presented with obstruction due to tumor ingrowth into the stent through the metallic mesh. Accordingly, initial enthusiasm concerning long-term patency of these stents has decreased. However, we describe a technique of ""diathermic cleaning"" of tumor ingrowth which can easily restore the stent patency. The advantages of these wire mesh 30 F stents are their easier insertion, better immediate drainage, and absence of dislocation or perforation. ",0
"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: an initial report. Sixty consecutive patients underwent an elective attempt at laparoscopic cholecystectomy between March 15 and July 31, 1990 at the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. Fifty-two patients had successful completion of the laparoscopic cholecystectomy (87%). The reasons for conversion to open cholecystectomy were acute cholecystitis (four patients), inability to define the cystic duct-common duct junction (three patients), and one patient with an unexpected choledochal cyst variant. Forty patients (77%) were discharged on the first post-operative day, and the remaining 12 patients on the second post-operative day. Thirty-three patients (63%) required only oral pain medication, and 11 patients (21%) needed no pain medication post-operatively. Fifty-one patients (98%) had resumed normal activities by the seventh post-operative day. Cholecystectomy remains the treatment of choice for biliary colic. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy minimizes length of stay in the hospital, lessens post-operative pain, allows quicker return to normal activities, and has a superior cosmetic result. ",0
"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy using intracorporeal lithotripsy. Over a 13-month period (November 1988 to December 1989), we performed our first 104 laparoscopic cholecystectomies using an intracorporeal ultrasonic lithotripsy technique. The procedure in three of these patients was converted to an open operation because of hemorrhage with unexpected findings of cirrhosis in two patients and dense subhepatic adhesions in a third. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was successfully used in three other patients in whom common bile duct stones were identified. We encountered only three postoperative complications out of all the laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed. One complication was a biliary fistula that closed spontaneously 1 week after surgery. The remaining complications were attributable to abscesses, one subhepatic and one pelvic, which were aspirated and drained laparoscopically. There were no deaths. Advantages of the laparoscopic approach included decreased perioperative pain, shortened hospitalization, absence of scar, and more rapid return to prehospitalization activities. ",0
"In vitro and in vivo consequences of VLA-2 expression on rhabdomyosarcoma cells. Cloned integrin alpha 2 subunit complementary DNA was expressed on human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells to give a functional VLA-2 (alpha 2 beta 1) adhesion receptor. The VLA-2-positive RDA2 cells not only showed increased adhesion to collagen and laminin in vitro, but also formed substantially more metastatic tumor colonies in nude mice after either intravenous or subcutaneous injection. These results show that a specific adhesion receptor (VLA-2) can markedly enhance both experimental and spontaneous metastasis. In contrast to the metastasis results, there was no difference in either the in vitro growth rate or apparent in vivo tumorigenicity of RD and RDA2 cells. ",0
"Plasma epinephrine levels in resuscitation with cardiopulmonary bypass. Since the highest plasma epinephrine levels have been recorded during resuscitation, we evaluated the isolated effect of cardiac arrest upon adrenomedullary secretion. We determined plasma epinephrine in dogs resuscitated with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) after cardiac arrest periods of 12 (CPB-12; n = 4) or 16 min (CPB-16; n = 5). Through 2 h of CPB and the following 6 h of critical care, there was no difference between CPB-12 and CPB-16 regarding most cardiopulmonary functional variables. Plasma epinephrine was markedly elevated immediately after initiation of CPB (p less than .01 at 1 min CPB vs. basal) and returned rapidly to basal concentrations. Comparison of plasma epinephrine levels between CPB and standard CPR groups showed that responses to cardiac arrest were similar (p greater than .05 at 1 min CPB vs. 11.5 min CPR). We conclude that cardiac arrest is the main or sole determinant of the plasma epinephrine elevation of resuscitation. ",0
"Recurrent peripheral facial nerve palsy after dental procedures. Peripheral facial palsy is an uncommon complication of dental procedures. Most cases begin immediately after dental anesthesia and resolve within 12 hours. No report of recurrent facial palsy with dental manipulations has previously been described. We report a patient with two episodes of peripheral facial palsy, 2 years apart, developing within 24 hours of dental procedures. A third episode of contralateral facial weakness developed 3 years after the second event. This event was not related to dental manipulations. Although the exact mechanism is not known, dental manipulations may rarely result in precipitation of recurrent Bell's palsy. ",0
"Brain stem tuberculoma in adult patients: diagnosis and treatment. A consecutive series of six adult patients ranging in age from 29 to 53 years is presented. The clinical and radiological features in each patient are described. Attention is drawn to the features demonstrated on computed axial tomography. In only one patient, the first encountered, was surgical excision undertaken and histological verification obtained. One patient died before any form of treatment could be instituted. The remaining four patients were treated with antituberculous chemotherapy alone and their progress monitored by sequential computed tomography. The excellent response and good outcome in this conservatively treated group are documented. ",0
"Prognostic factors in acute renal failure following aortic aneurysm surgery. This study analyses the prognostic factors associated with survival in 70 patients who developed acute renal failure following surgery for an aortic aneurysm. Forty-nine patients (70 per cent) had surgery for a ruptured aortic aneurysm and 21 patients (30 per cent) had an elective procedure. Fifty-nine patients received haemodialysis. Thirty-three patients (47 per cent) survived the episode of acute renal failure. Six of these thirty-three patients died within three months of recovering from acute renal failure, giving an overall survival of 27/70 (39 per cent). A stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that the following factors significantly adversely affected survival: a need for inotropic support, ventilation for more than three days and age over 65 years. A model developed using these variables provided a basis for predicting outcome. ",0
"Association of acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie's syndrome) with herpes zoster. Ogilvie's syndrome, or acute pseudo-obstruction of the colon is characterized by massive distension of the colon in the absence of organic distal obstruction. The syndrome is associated with various unrelated and, most often, extra-abdominal causes. An association between Ogilvie's syndrome and herpes zoster has been reported only once, by Ceccese et al. in 1985. We present a second such case. This patient did not show evidence of any active illness other than the involvement of the T10 dermatome by herpes zoster. The patient's symptoms of colonic obstruction subsided with resolution of the zosteriform rash. ",0
"Autologous transplantation of adrenal medulla in Parkinson's disease. 18-month results. Eighteen of 19 patients who underwent autologous adrenal medullary transplantation to the right caudate nucleus have been followed up for 18 months. During the course of this study, a statistically significant improvement was noted in percent ""on"" time, percent ""on"" time without dyskinesia, activity of daily living (ADL) scores during the ""on"" stages, and ADL, motor, and Schwab-England scores during the ""off"" stages. Benefits tended to be maximal at 6 months and to gradually lessen thereafter, although statistically significant improvement in comparison with baseline was still present at 18 months for ADL, motor, and Hoehn-Yahr scores during the ""off"" stages. Almost all parameters had deteriorated by 18 months compared with 12 months, including those remaining significantly improved in comparison with baseline. These patterns were similar for each of the three participating centers. Complications were largely restricted to the perioperative period. ",0
"Unilateral hydrocephalus in adults. The authors report 14 cases of unilateral hydrocephalus in adults. Headache was the most common presenting symptom. Unilateral hydrocephalus was documented in each patient with computed tomography scans; magnetic resonance imaging was also used in seven patients in the latter part of the series. Unilateral hydrocephalus was caused by tumor (seven patients), venous angioma (one patient), ependymal cyst (one patient), postinflammatory gliosis (one patient), and was idiopathic in four patients. The primary surgical treatment was craniotomy with fenestration of the septum pellucidum, which relieved symptoms in eight of nine patients for whom long-term follow-up data were available. ",0
"Bleeding ectatic vascular lesion involving the sigmoid colon, endoscopically indistinguishable from angiodysplasia, in an 8-yr-old boy. An 8-yr-old Japanese boy was hospitalized, complaining of active hematochezia. He was shown to have a cherry-red, blood-oozing area of vascular dilation with mucosal prominence in the sigmoid colon by endoscopy, but had no other mucocutaneous vascular abnormalities. A family history was noncontributory. Under the clinical diagnosis of angiodysplasia of the sigmoid colon, he underwent an elliptical resection of the part, based on the intraoperative endoscopic findings. However, histological examination of the surgical specimen revealed a totally different picture from that seen in angiodysplasia: the thin-walled, markedly ectatic, nontortuous veins with hemorrhage were seen only just below the muscularis mucosae, around which the normal ones were shown to coexist. He has had no rebleeding for the past 3 yr. This lesion is considered to be an isolated congenital visceral telangiectasia involving veins. ",0
"Pulmonary vascular steal in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. After pulmonary thromboendarterectomy, performed for relief of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, perfusion lung scans have frequently disclosed new perfusion defects in segments served by undissected pulmonary arteries. Our hypotheses were that these new postoperative defects occurred with great frequency and did not represent postoperative vessel occlusion. We retrospectively reviewed the preoperative and postoperative perfusion scans of 33 consecutive patients undergoing pulmonary thromboendarterectomy. New postoperative perfusion defects were noted in 23 of 33 patients. The incidence of new defects was increased tenfold in segments that had (1) normal preoperative angiographic findings, (2) normal preoperative radionuclide perfusion, and (3) not been entered at the time of surgery. Postoperative angiograms, available in 15 of 33 patients, documented the nonembolic, nonocclusive nature of the new perfusion scan defects. The most plausible alternate explanation for this previously undescribed finding is a redistribution of pulmonary arterial resistance induced by the thromboendarterectomy, namely, a pulmonary vascular ""steal."".

"Controlled trial of antimycobacterial therapy in Crohn's disease. Clofazimine versus placebo. In order to study the effect of clofazimine, a powerful antimycobacterial and antiinflammatory agent, 49 patients with active Crohn's disease were randomized to either corticosteroids plus clofazimine 100 mg daily (N = 25) or to steroids and matching placebo (N = 24). A total of 28 patients (58%) went into disease remission (clofazimine 16, placebo 12; P = NS) with a fall in disease activity score from 10.5 +/- 4.4 to 3.3 +/- 3.5. Patients were treated for a further eight months with clofazimine or placebo and 18 of 28 maintained their remission and completed the study (clofazimine 12, placebo 6; P = NS). Side effects were minor and consisted of skin rash and increased pigmentation. Clofazimine as a solitary antimycobacterial agent appears ineffective in inducing remission in Crohn's disease but may have a role in either disease maintenance or combination chemotherapy. ",0
"Recurrent herpetic keratitis: failure to detect herpes simplex virus infection using the Syva MicroTrak HSV1/HSV2 direct specimen identification/typing test. A 35-year-old man had developed recurrent herpetic keratitis characterized by dendritic keratitis at intervals of a year. We were able to culture cytopathic agents repeatedly from his lesions by inoculating Vero cells. The cultures yielded definitive evidence of a virus that caused a cytopathic effect within 3 days. However, these virus strains could not be identified as herpes simplex virus (HSV) in immunofluorescence assays using the Syva MicroTrak HSV1/HSV2 direct specimen identification/typing test. Rather they were identified as strains of HSV type 1 (HSV-1) on the basis of plaque morphology, neutralization tests, electron-microscopic examination and DNA restriction endonuclease analysis. Our results allow us to assume the existence of HSV-1 strains isolated clinically that are negative to analysis using the Syva Micro-Trak HSV1/HSV2 direct specimen identification/typing test. ",0
"Obstructive sleep apnea presenting with nocturnal angina, heart failure, and near-miss sudden death. An obese woman with a one-year history of episodic nocturnal chest pain was admitted because of shock and pulmonary edema. A clinical diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock was made. She was ventilated and successfully resuscitated. Subsequent investigations showed no evidence of cardiac dysfunction or coronary disease, but sleep study confirmed the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). We suggest that the nocturnal angina and heart failure in this patient might have resulted from extreme hypoxemia produced by OSAS. This case raised the possibility that the high cardiovascular mortality rate reported in OSAS might not necessarily relate to underlying coronary artery disease. Further investigations are required to delineate the true incidence of coronary disease in patients with OSAS. ",0
"Late metastases of cutaneous melanoma: case report and literature review. The development of delayed metastases, although rare, is well documented in patients with invasive cutaneous melanoma. Only 24 cases, including ours, are clearly documented in the literature. We describe a 56-year-old woman who had an acral lentiginous melanoma of the right hand (thickness 1.2 mm). Thirteen years after excision and postoperative irradiation, a subcutaneous metastasis developed in the right arm. One year later the patient died with disseminated bone metastases. This case, as with most of those with delayed metastases, has typical features: female sex; location at a site other than the back, arm, neck, or scalp; and primary tumor thickness between 1.2 and 2.5 mm.

"Resolved and unresolved issues in the prevention and treatment of coronary artery disease: a workshop consensus statement. Advances in cardiovascular research during the past two decades have resulted in an improved understanding of the chain of events that lead to end-stage coronary artery disease. These developments have been paralleled by therapeutic advances that now make it possible to intervene at virtually every stage in the development of advanced cardiac disease, from asymptomatic persons at risk of developing coronary atherosclerosis to patients with end-stage heart failure. By interrupting this chain of events, perhaps at multiple sites, it may be possible to prevent or slow the development of symptomatic heart disease and hopefully prolong life. Many opportunities exist for obtaining further information regarding the underlying pathophysiology, the fundamental mechanisms of action of interventions designed to prevent and/or treat the development of myocardial ischemia and cardiac failure and for effecting favorably the natural history of various forms of heart disease.

"Audit of results of operations for infantile pyloric stenosis in a district general hospital Because of the proposal that infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis should only be treated by surgeons with an interest in paediatric surgery, we carried out a retrospective study to audit our experience in a district general hospital. Forty six infants over a five year period underwent pyloromyotomy. There were no deaths, and 36 infants (78%) made uneventful recoveries. Perforation of the duodenal mucosa occurred during the operation in 11 patients, and eight complications developed in six of these infants. There were seven wound infections, and two patients had vomiting that lasted four days or longer after their operations. There were no long term feeding problems. The results of this study show that such patients can be successfully treated in district general hospitals, and three areas merit special attention: meticulous surgical technique, the use of prophylactic antibiotics, and early graduated feeding.

"Cup containment and orientation in cemented total hip arthroplasties. We reviewed the radiographs of 864 Charnley and STH (Zimmer) cemented total hip arthroplasties with a mean follow-up of seven years (maximum 16 years). Survivorship analysis was used to assess the correlation between radiographic performance and the bony containment or the coronal orientation of the acetabular cup. The cup orientation and containment were interrelated; all vertically oriented cups were completely contained, whereas 25% of more horizontal cups were only partially contained. Completely contained cups had significantly lower incidences of complete cement-bone radiolucency (p = 0.02) and of wear (p = 0.09). Vertically oriented cups had a lower incidence of continuous radiolucency than neutrally oriented cups, but this was not statistically significant (p = 0.25). Our results confirm the importance of complete bony containment, and also indicate that it is better to accept vertical orientation and obtain full bony coverage than to have a more horizontal orientation with partial containment.

Inner ear cholesteatoma and the preservation of cochlear function. Labyrinthine destruction by direct cholesteatoma invasion has always been considered a serious threat to the inner ear function. A number of reports in the literature have cited both patients who had preservation of hearing despite widespread erosion of the labyrinth by cholesteatoma and patients who had retained auditory function despite surgical removal of the matrix from the labyrinth. In most cases the vestibular portion of the inner ear was invaded but cases of cochlear involvement have been described as well. Twelve cases with pre-operative auditory function preservation despite extensive labyrinthine destruction treated at our Institution are reported. Seven cases retained cochlear function post-operatively. Possible explanations of this occurrence and implications of related with hearing preservation in the presence of widespread inner ear destruction by chronic inflammatory disease are discussed. ,0
"Urodynamic morbidity and dysuria prophylaxis. A group of 324 patients received prophylactic treatment with either sodium bicarbonate, potassium citrate or a glucose placebo following urodynamic studies. Urine was screened for infection both before and after testing and the incidence of dysuria assessed by postal questionnaire; 63% of patients experienced some degree of dysuria and this was severe and prolonged in 6.3%, the majority of whom were male. Neither sodium bicarbonate nor potassium citrate was any more effective in preventing dysuria than placebo. The presence of severe prolonged dysuria was not associated with a urinary tract infection or with any particular urodynamic diagnosis. ",0
"Indium-111-antimyosin scintigraphy after doxorubicin therapy in patients with advanced breast cancer Indium-111-antimyosin (111In-antimyosin) scans were performed in 20 women with advanced breast cancer after 10 cycles of chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil and doxorubicin (total cumulative dose of doxorubicin of 500 mg/m2). Antimyosin uptake in the myocardium was quantified by means of a heart-to-lung ratio (HLR). Antimyosin uptake in the myocardium was observed in 17/20 (85%) patients, and HLR after chemotherapy was 1.86 +/- 0.25. Left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) was determined before and after chemotherapy. Patients with decreased EF (8/20, 40%) presented with more intense antimyosin uptake (HLR of 2.11 +/- 0.10 versus 1.70 +/- 0.16 (p = 0.01]. HLR values correlated with EF values after chemotherapy (r = -0.47, p less than 0.05). Positive antimyosin studies after chemotherapy including doxorubicin, indicate the presence of myocardial damage in these patients. Antimyosin studies are a sensitive method to detect myocyte damage in patients after doxorubicin therapy. ",0
"Prevention of hypotension following spinal anaesthesia for elective caesarean section by wrapping of the legs. Twenty-four parturients undergoing elective Caesarean section were allocated randomly to have the legs wrapped with elasticated Esmarch bandages immediately following spinal anaesthesia or to serve as controls. Significant hypotension (systolic arterial pressure less than 100 mm Hg and less than 80% of baseline value) was treated with i.v. ephedrine in 5-mg boluses. Leg wrapped patients had a significantly (P = 0.0033) lower incidence (16.7%) of hypotension than controls (83.3%). Only two patients in the leg wrapped group required ephedrine compared with 10 in the control group. Systolic arterial pressure was significantly (P less than 0.05) less in control subjects at 4, 5 and 6 min following spinal injection. No patient in the leg wrapped group became hypotensive following removal of the elasticated bandages. ",0
"Fatal sepsis following intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin administration for bladder cancer. Intravesical administration of bacillus Calmette-Guerin has been shown to be highly effective treatment of superficial bladder cancer. Complications from bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy are usually minor but serious and even fatal reactions can occur. Five recent cases illustrate the gravity of bacillus Calmette-Guerin sepsis. One man with severe debility and the organic brain syndrome died acutely with a fever of 40 C. Two men had frank sepsis that progressed to multiorgan failure and death. Sepsis progressed despite the use of isoniazid, rifampin and streptomycin. Two men who had equally progressive sepsis with intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin survived with the use of cycloserine for the first 72 hours of treatment. Triple antituberculous antibiotics, including cycloserine, may be lifesaving. Sepsis resulted from intravenous absorption through inflamed or disrupted urothelium. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin treatment should not be administered in the presence of severe cystitis or after grossly traumatic catheterization. ",0
"Intravesical condyloma acuminatum with progression to verrucous carcinoma. Condyloma acuminatum is a common form of venereal disease. Most patients with condylomata acuminata suffer from only the local cosmetic and irritative effects of the lesions. Few patients have progression to aggressive, regionally distributed lesions that can be life-threatening. We describe a forty-three-year-old white woman who had a seventeen-year history of scleroderma with extravesical and intravesical condylomata acuminata. During two years of conservative management with transurethral excision, electrocoagulation, and intravesical chemotherapy, the disease progressed to involve the entire bladder and resulted in obstructive renal insufficiency that required anterior exenteration and urinary diversion. The natural history of the disease is described, and the relevant literature is reviewed. ",0
"Fatal pulmonary embolism caused by streptokinase treatment of deep venous thrombosis of the leg? During the last 10 years, four of 150 (2.7%) patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) treated with streptokinase (SK) at our department have died of pulmonary embolism (PE). A retrospective study of 1393 DVT patients treated with heparin during the period 1973-1986 showed that five (0.36%) of these patients died of PE while still on heparin. In this paper we describe the four patients treated with SK who developed fatal PE. In our opinion this increase in mortality does not warrant the use of SK in routine treatment of DVT of the leg before a proper trial has been conducted to compare the frequencies of pulmonary embolism after both treatments.

"Plasma thrombin-antithrombin III complexes in the diagnosis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma complicating liver cirrhosis. Detection of hypercoagulable state might be helpful in the diagnosis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) complicating liver cirrhosis (LC). Plasma levels of thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT) were determined in 50 patients of LC with or without HCC. The levels were above 2 ng/ml in 80% of 25 HCC patients, but only in 12% of 25 non-HCC patients (P less than 0.01). The levels over 2 ng/ml occurred even in five of six HCC patients whose serum alpha-fetoprotein levels were below 20 ng/ml as well as in two of three patients with HCC less than 2 cm in diameter. Those levels in HCC patients were significantly decreased within 8 days after treatment with transcatheter arterial embolization or infusion of antitumor agents, without affecting plasma antithrombin III levels. These results suggest that plasma TAT levels may be useful in the diagnosis of HCC complicating LC. ",0
"Dwarf locus mutants lacking three pituitary cell types result from mutations in the POU-domain gene pit-1. Mutations at the mouse dwarf locus (dw) interrupt the normal development of the anterior pituitary gland, resulting in the loss of expression of growth hormone, prolactin and thyroid-stimulating hormone, and hypoplasia of their respective cell types. Disruptions in the gene encoding the POU-domain transcription factor, Pit-1, occur in both characterized alleles of the dwarf locus. The data indicate that Pit-1 is necessary for the specification of the phenotype of three cell types in the anterior pituitary, and directly link a transcription factor to commitment and progression events in mammalian organogenesis.

"Steroid anabolic drugs and arterial complications in an athlete--a case history. Serious side effects and complications have been attributed to anabolic and androgenic steroids when used for medical reasons or when taken in sports in hopes of increasing strength and, hence, performance. The author presents a case of an athlete who experienced two metachronous arterial complications after taking these drugs: a cerebrovascular accident caused by a carotid artery thrombus that partially embolized to the brain and, later, a severe ischemic episode in a lower limb caused by a diffused distal arterial thrombosis. This patient represents the first reported case of vascular events in an otherwise healthy athlete taking androgens to increase his skeletal muscle mass. ",0
"The ""numb cheek-limp lower lid"" syndrome. A patient developed isolated numbness, 1st confined to the lateral nose and upper lip, but later involving the cheek, lower lip, upper gingiva, and the palate. This numbness was later associated with paresis of the muscles of the upper lip and angle of the mouth and with ipsilateral lower lid droop (the ""numb cheek-limp lower lid"" syndrome). Squamous cell carcinoma was discovered infiltrating the infraorbital nerve and distal branches of the facial nerve. Cheek numbness associated with lower eyelid or upper lip weakness may herald a neoplasm affecting the infraorbital nerve and distal facial nerve branches. ",0
"Epidemiology of primary osteogenic sarcoma in the San Francisco Bay Area of California. This epidemiologic study represents an analysis of all registered new cases of osteogenic sarcoma (OGS) during the 14-year period from January 1973 to December 1986 in five San Francisco Bay counties. Inclusion into the study was limited to patients who were diagnosed in the first three decades of life and who were residents within the Bay Area at the time of diagnosis. To determine epidemiologic characteristics of OGS, records on 96 patients from the Bay Area Resources for Cancer Control with histologically proven OGS were reviewed. The incidence of OGS was influenced by age, gender, and race, but none of the effects were statistically significant. A geographic variation in the incidence of OGS was discovered, although it was not statistically significant. The results are presented in support of a continued search for environmental variables that may someday reveal the etiologic factors of OGS. ",0
"A prospective randomized evaluation of chronic peritoneal catheters. Insertion site and intraperitoneal segment. The insertion site (midline or through the lateral rectus muscle) and type of chronic dialysis catheter (straight or spiral intraperitoneal segment) were evaluated in a prospective randomized trial. Dialysis catheter complications and catheter survival were the endpoints of evaluation. Eighty-five first catheters were evaluated. Neither race, gender, renal diagnosis, type of catheter, nor insertion site was a determinant of dialysis catheter survival. Overall median catheter survival was 308 days. There were 40 catheter complications (70%, n = 28) that occurred during the first 61 days following insertion. Median time to the first complication occurring within the first 61 days was 3 days. Late catheter removals were due to peritonitis episodes that failed to resolve. Complications are frequent with peritoneal dialysis catheters, and care of the peritoneal dialysis catheters requires constant vigilance. ",0
"Neurofibromatosis type 2: report of a family and review of current evaluation and treatment. Significant advances during the past decade have greatly improved our understanding of neurofibromatosis type 2, a genetic disease which results in bilateral acoustic neuromas. The emergence of gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging has allowed early detection of minute intracanalicular eighth-nerve tumors, less than 1 cm in diameter. Recombinant DNA studies have clarified the genetics that underlie neurofibromatosis type 2 and separate it from a variety of related conditions, such as von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis. Early diagnosis and surgical removal of these tumors may offer the only hope of preserving hearing and facial nerve function. A report of the evaluation and treatment of a family with multiple affected individuals will exemplify these conclusions. ",0
"Dysgeusia, gustatory sweating, and crocodile tears syndrome induced by a cerebellopontine angle meningioma. Facial nerve involvement in cerebellopontine angle tumors, both during their development and after excision, may be expressed in irreversible dysfunction of the parasympathetic pathways. The exact location of the lesion along the efferent nerve fibers can be established through evaluation of the functional level of those organs supplied by the cholinergic motor secretory components. This report deals with a female patient in whom peripheral facial palsy developed shortly after removal of a right cerebellopontine angle meningioma. She had slight facial asymmetry and deafness in the right ear and complained of prandial flush and sweating of the right malar area. Occult ipsilateral hyposalivation and hypolacrimation were diagnosed. In patients with seventh and ninth cranial nerve pathoses, evaluation of the end organs that are supplied by their associated autonomous nerve fibers is mandatory to prevent late ocular and oral sequelae.

"Low-dose aspirin does not influence the clinical course of women with mild pregnancy-induced hypertension. The effect of low doses of aspirin on women with mild pregnancy-induced hypertension was investigated by means of a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial. Forty-seven women hospitalized at 30-36 weeks' gestation because of mild pregnancy-induced hypertension were treated by a daily dose of either 100 mg aspirin or placebo. The mean blood pressure values, rates of development of severe preeclampsia, gestational ages at delivery, newborn weights, and 5-minute Apgar scores were similar in the aspirin-treated and the placebo-treated groups. We conclude that low-dose aspirin is not curative but is essentially a preventive treatment which, in order to be effective, should be started weeks before clinical signs of preeclampsia are present.

Prolonged response to carboplatin in an infant with brain stem glioma. Adults and children with brain stem gliomas have a mean survival time of 15 months after radiation therapy (XRT). Infants with this tumor present additional complexities for treatment because of possible neurotoxicity of the radiation to the developing brain. We report a 15-month-old child with biopsy-proven brain stem glioma with clinical and radiographic evidence of disease progression. She was treated with 24 monthly courses of carboplatin without radiation therapy and has had a 39+ month response. The clinical response started after 3 months and the radiographic evidence was documented at 10 months by magnetic resonance imaging. The toxicity was minimal. Longitudinal neuropsychological assessment demonstrated continued improvement at 36 months post diagnosis but with some motor functioning below expected age levels. Cervico-medullary astrocytoma in a young patient may be the appropriate clinical setting for future trials of chemotherapy without XRT. ,0
"Pyogenic spinal sepsis in adults. Twenty adult patients presented with bacteriologically and histologically proven nontuberculous spinal sepsis. Thirteen patients presented with varying degrees of neurologic impairment. All patients underwent spinal decompression; in 11 this was combined with an anterior fusion using autogenous tricortical iliac grafts. All patients have recovered and are ambulatory, and no patient's disorder was made worse by surgery. Twenty-three separate organisms were cultured, only five of which were Staphylococcus. The antibiotic courses were shorter and pain relief more rapid with anterior fusion. All anterior bone grafts incorporated rapidly, and there was no progression of kyphosis or sequestration of grafts, regardless of organisms or level. The rational treatment of adult spinal sepsis necessitates the securing of tissue from the spine for histologic and bacteriologic examination. Pain relief, stabilization, and neural decompression can best be achieved with anterior decompression and fusion. Autogenous iliac crest grafts incorporate in the presence of sepsis. ",0
"Plaque morphology and pathologic changes in arteries from patients dying after coronary balloon angioplasty Morphologic correlates of pathologic success or failure were studied at autopsy in 28 patients with 40 coronary arteries that had been subjected to balloon angioplasty. The presence of the following histologic features was evaluated: plaque concentricity or eccentricity, calcification, fibrous or fibropultaceous plaque, medial disruption, luminal thrombus and inflammation. Angioplasty was considered successful (residual cross-sectional luminal area greater than 25%) on pathologic examination in 14 arteries and unsuccessful in 26 arteries. Eccentric plaques were more likely to be successfully dilated than were concentric lesions (p less than 0.05). Six (50%) of 12 fibropultaceous plaques were successfully dilated compared with only 8 (29%) of 28 fibrous plaques. Moderate to severe calcification did not preclude morphologic success. Medial stretching or dissection, or both, was more often associated with a successful result. Thus, plaque morphology may be an important determinant of pathologic outcome after coronary angioplasty.

"Embryologic fusion planes and the spread of cutaneous carcinoma: a review and reassessment. It has long been held that embryologic fusion planes influence the spread of skin cancer. Embryologic fusion planes have been implicated in the depth of invasion, horizontal spread, and recurrence of cutaneous carcinoma. However, these structures have never been studied in detail. A review of the surgical literature reveals considerable confusion regarding the exact nature, location, and tumor interactions of these fusion planes. We review the gross and microscopic development of sites of embryologic fusion. We examine histologic sections through fusion sites in normally developed adult and fetal fresh cadaver specimens. Our studies, supported by our review of developmental anatomy, indicate that fusion planes do not persist as identifiable anatomic structures that would influence tumor spread. ",0
"Duodenal ulcer is associated with low dietary linoleic acid intake. It has been suggested that the falling incidence and virulence of duodenal ulcer is related to increased dietary polyunsaturated essential fatty acid intake. The adipose fatty acid profile, which closely reflects dietary intake, was measured in 35 men with chronic duodenal ulcer and 35 matched control men. The mean percentage of linoleic acid in adipose tissue was significantly lower in the ulcer group (10.0 (0.7) v 12.3 (0.7)%, p less than 0.01) and this difference was found in both smokers and non-smokers. This finding suggests that the diets of duodenal ulcer patients are deficient in linoleic acid and this could be of aetiological importance. ",0
"Epidemiologic risk factors for children with acute lower respiratory tract infection in Buenos Aires, Argentina: a matched case-control study. The risk factors that predisposed 516 hospitalized and 154 ambulatory patients to acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI) are examined in a matched case-control study. The control group was selected from children attending immunization and well-baby clinics at the same institution that was treating the children with ALRI. Sex, age, nutritional status, socioeconomic level, as well as season and place of residence were used as matching criteria. Because of their distinct profiles, hospitalized and outpatient groups were analyzed separately. However, the four variables with the highest odds ratios (incidence ratios or relative risk) were found to be the same for both groups. These variables were related to the host's condition (bronchial hyperreactivity, presence of persistent symptoms of the upper respiratory tract), family (presence of acute respiratory tract disease in household members), and environment (indoor contaminants).

"De novo carcinoma of the lower urinary tract in renal allograft recipients. Immunocompetence has been postulated as an important defense against the progression of urothelial carcinoma. Three cases of de novo lower urinary tract carcinoma in renal transplant recipients demonstrated the potential for unusually rapid urothelial extension and invasion in chronically immunosuppressed patients. Two patients had a history of perineal condyloma acuminata; tumors from 1 of these harbored the genetic sequences of human papillomavirus type 6. One patient had multiple manifestations of cyclophosphamide-related urothelial injury, including bladder carcinoma. Treatment of 2 patients culminated in a radical operation during which the remaining native urinary system was resected completely, with sacrifice of the allograft kidney in 1 and diversion into an ileal conduit in 1. The remaining patient underwent urethrectomy and partial cystectomy with a sigmoid conduit. ",0
"Orthostatic hypotension after spinal cord injury: treatment with fludrocortisone and ergotamine. We report a case of a 28-year-old woman with C5 quadriplegia, unresponsive to conservative treatment for orthostatic hypotension. Ergotamine, daily combined with fludrocortisone, successfully prevented symptomatic hypotension. In this report, neural, renal, and hormonal blood pressure regulatory mechanisms are described. Experiences obtained from this case and the existing literature suggest that (1) in persons with quadriplegia, plasma catecholamine levels show little increase with sitting, indicating an inability to activate baroreceptor and chemoreceptor reflexes, (2) elevated plasma aldosterone and renin levels indicate a renal compensatory response to decreased renal perfusion secondary to low plasma volume and/or chronic hypotension, and (3) the net effect of ergotamine and fludrocortisone is probably a combination of plasma volume expansion and direct peripheral vasoconstriction.

"Longitudinal histopathologic assessment of rejection after bladder-drained canine pancreas allograft transplantation. In preparation for assessment of percutaneous biopsies in our clinical pancreas transplant program, a working knowledge of the histopathologic changes after transplantation was obtained in a longitudinal open biopsy study of 16 dogs receiving bladder-drained whole pancreas allografts. Edema, extravasation of polymorphs, and lymphocytes associated with focal parenchymal injury were early, invariable, and probably nonspecific findings. The initial feature of unmodified rejection was the appearance of capillary and small vein endothelial changes with mainly perivascular inflammatory cell infiltration. Acinar cell loss occurred early and was progressive, whereas islets and ducts were relatively preserved, indicating that acinar tissue may be more vulnerable to lytic necrosis when damaged. Functional rejection, determined by fasting urinary amylase levels, was at a stage of extensive and irreversible necrosis. Functioning grafts in immunosuppressed dogs had minor and transient endothelial changes with absence of class II antigen staining of parenchymal cells. ",0
"Insulinoma after streptozotocin therapy for metastatic gastrinoma: natural history or iatrogenic complication? Islet cell carcinoma frequently produces more than one chemical product, although its clinical expression is usually restricted to a single hormone. We describe an unusual patient who presented with full-blown metastasizing gastrinoma. He was treated with cimetidine for five years and then streptozotocin therapy, which resulted in a regression in hepatomegaly and a fall in serum gastrin levels. Following one year's therapy with streptozotocin, he was admitted in hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemic stupor. This appears to be the first reported case of a ""shift"" from clinical gastrinoma to insulinoma possibly related to prolonged streptozotocin therapy. ",0
"Survival rates from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: recommendations for uniform definitions and data to report. Survival rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest vary widely among locations. We surveyed the definitions used in published studies of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Data from 74 studies involving 36 communities showed survival rates ranging from 2% to 44%. There were five different case definitions and 11 different definitions of survivors. The absence of uniform definitions prevents meaningful intersystem comparisons, prohibits explorations of hypotheses about effective interventions, and interferes with the efforts of quality assurance. The most satisfactory numerator for a survival rate appears to be survival to hospital discharge; the most appropriate denominator appears to be witnessed adult cardiac arrest of presumed heart disease etiology, with ventricular fibrillation as the initial identified rhythm. Proposed definitions for the data emergency medical services systems should report as they examine their cardiac arrest survival rates are presented. ",0
"The Hastings bipolar hemiarthroplasty for subcapital fractures of the femoral neck. A 10-year prospective study. In a 10-year prospective study, 561 displaced subcapital fractures of the femoral neck in 546 patients were treated with the Hastings bipolar hemiarthroplasty. Within six months of their operations, 148 patients had died. In 322 hips followed up, 243 with adequate serial radiographs separated by more than one year, only 14 (5.6%) showed acetabular erosion. A group of 91 had been reviewed for between three and nine years (mean, 4 years 10 months) and of these, 95% had no pain or slight pain only. Comparison with an earlier series of conventional hemiarthroplasties reported from this institution showed that the clinical results were similar, but that the erosion rate had been halved. ",0
"A case-control study of Alzheimer's disease in Australia. We conducted a case-control study of clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (AD) on 170 cases aged 52 to 96 years, and 170 controls matched for age, sex and, where possible, the general practice of origin. Trained lay interviewers naive to the hypotheses and to the clinical status of the elderly person carried out risk-factor interviews with informants. Significant odds ratios were found for 4 variables: a history of either dementia, probable AD, or Down's syndrome in a 1st-degree relative, and underactivity as a behavioral trait in both the recent and more distant past. Previously reported or suggested associations not confirmed by this study include head injury, starvation, thyroid disease, analgesic abuse, antacid use (aluminum exposure), alcohol abuse, smoking, and being left-handed.

"Thirty-six month follow-up of a contemporary phakic intraocular lens for the surgical correction of myopia. Twenty-three eyes underwent implantation of a glass anterior chamber phakic myopic intraocular lens by one of the surgeon co-authors. The follow-up was 18 to 36 months. All refractions were unchanged and stable within six weeks after surgery. Best-corrected visual acuity was achieved in all cases; in 56% of operated eyes, a one-to-three line visual improvement was noted over the preoperative status. No operative complications were encountered; no postoperative complications were noted in either the immediate or delayed phase. No intraocular lenses were removed. There was a 5.3% loss in endothelial cell count which was unchanged throughout the study. The contemporary phakic myopic intraocular lens offers a seminal approach to the surgical treatment of myopia. ",0
"Ki-67 immunostaining in uveal melanoma. The effect of pre-enucleation radiotherapy. The reactivity of 33 choroidal and ciliary body melanomas with monoclonal antibody Ki-67, which recognizes a proliferation associated nuclear antigen, has been assessed and compared with clinicopathologic parameters. In 23 cases, 8 Gy irradiation was given 2 days before enucleation. Nonirradiated melanomas had a significantly higher proliferation rate as defined by staining with monoclonal antibody Ki-67 as compared with irradiated tumors (P = 0.007). Similarly, a strong relationship was found between pre-enucleation irradiation and low mitotic activity (P = 0.001). There was no significant correlation between the presence of Ki-67-positive nuclei and histologic classification, largest tumor diameter, localization of the tumor, age, sex, scleral invasion, pigmentation, and lymphocytic infiltration. The relevance of Ki-67 immunohistochemistry for the assessment of the life prognosis of patients with uveal melanoma has to be studied prospectively. ",0
"Sympathomimetics for acute severe asthma: should only beta 2-selective agonists be used? Sympathomimetics have become a mainstay of the treatment of acute asthma. Aerosolization of sympathomimetics provides as great or greater bronchodilation in acute severe asthma with fewer systemic effects than parenteral therapy. Despite the broncho-selectivity achieved with this route of administration, cardiostimulation remains the major, dose-limiting factor in the safe use of sustained, high-dose therapy with these agents. This article reviews the pharmacology, adverse effects, and toxicities of selected beta agonists, as well as clinical studies relevant to the question posed in the title. Although the ideal study to answer this question has not yet been performed, the authors feel that available evidence supports the preferential use of selective beta 2 agonists in patients with acute, severe asthma who will require high doses of beta agonists.

"Practice effects on the preprogramming of discrete movements in Parkinson's disease. The effects of practice on the simple and choice reaction times (RTs) of Parkinson's disease (PD) and control subjects in a discrete aiming task were analysed. For controls, practice led to a selective decrease in choice RTs, as has been reported previously. An opposite effect was seen in the PD group, with little change in choice RTs and substantial reduction in simple RTs. The results suggest that PD subjects can use advance information to initiate discrete movements more rapidly, but that this ability to ""preprogramme"" movements requires practice. Reconciliation of these results with studies reporting an inability to preprogramme in PD are made in a discussion of task characteristics which may allow or preclude preprogramming. ",0
"Multimodality therapy for advanced and recurrent vulvar squamous cell carcinoma. A pilot project. From 1985 to 1989 eight women with advanced or recurrent vulvar carcinoma were treated at the Women's Cancer Center of the University of Minnesota Hospital and Clinic. Each received a combination of 5-fluorouracil, mitomycin C and cisplatin during radiotherapy. Five of the eight women who underwent posttreatment radical vulvectomy had acceptable operative morbidity. Six patients experienced a complete clinical response. Of them, one had microscopic residual disease in the surgical specimen. One patient with recurrent vulvar carcinoma experienced progression of disease on therapy. One death was attributable to chemotherapy toxicity, and two patients died of intercurrent disease. The overall survival rate at 27 months was 33%. This multimodality approach to the treatment of advanced vulvar carcinoma should be considered when designing a therapeutic approach to treating extensive or resistant vulvar carcinoma. ",0
"A rare case of renovascular hypertension due to iatrogenic thoracoabdominal aortic dissection. A report of successful surgical treatment in childhood. Renovascular hypertension due to iatrogenic thoracoabdominal aortic dissection in an 8-year-old girl with aortic valvular stenosis is presented. A splenorenal arterial anastomosis without splenectomy was successfully performed. This procedure is considered best suited for children with thoracoabdominal aortic dissection as the autogenous graft is expected to grow and provide long-term patency. The spleen left in situ was expected to be advantageous, from the immunological aspect, at the time of open heart surgery for aortic valvular stenosis, which was anticipated in the near future in this child.

"Neonatal intracranial choriocarcinoma. A 1-month-old infant died from extensive intracerebral hemorrhage due to a metastatic choriocarcinoma to the brain that presumably originated in the placenta. The clinical course was characterized by hyperbilirubinemia, repeated episodes of seizures, and intracranial hemorrhage. A computed tomographic scan revealed a large vascular mass in the left parieto-occipital region and a small lesion in the left frontal lobe. The placenta was expelled during the delivery and was not examined. In view of the high level of maternal human chorionic gonadotropic hormone and the autopsy finding of metastasis, we presumed that the mass was a metastatic choriocarcinoma that had originated in the maternal placenta. To our knowledge, only one previous instance of this phenomenon has been reported. ",0
"Cerebrospinal fluid neopterin in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection. We evaluated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of neopterin, a putative marker of activated macrophages, in 97 subjects infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 who had a spectrum of neurological complications. The highest CSF neopterin concentrations occurred in those with neurological opportunistic infections, primary central nervous systems lymphoma, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) dementia complex. In general, the CSF concentration of neopterin was independent of CSF cell count and blood-brain barrier disruption to albumin. In the patients with AIDS dementia complex, CSF neopterin concentrations correlated with severity of disease and decreased in conjunction with clinical improvement following treatment with zidovudine. These results suggest that CSF neopterin, although not disease-specific, may be useful as a surrogate marker for the presence of AIDS dementia complex and its response to antiviral therapy. ",0
"Retroperitoneal mobilization of the vas deferens in the complex vasovasostomy. Anatomic distances along retroperitoneal, inguinal, and infrainguinal segments of the vas deferens were measured in 14 formalin fixed cadavers and in 15 recently postmortem males. There were no significant differences in segment lengths between the two groups nor between the right and left vasa. Data from the recent postmortem group reveals a mean length of 5.83 +/- .65 cm to be gained from retroperitoneal mobilization of the vas deferens. This information is important to surgical decisions in cases of microsurgical repair of obstructive azoospermia resulting from damage to the inguinal segment of the vas deferens. Data on other vasal segment lengths is beneficial for planning repair in other complex cases of obstructive azoospermia as well. ",0
"Biliary cholesterol transport and precipitation: introduction and overview of conference. Cholesterol is secreted into bile as cholesterol-phospholipid vesicles. The cholesterol and phospholipid are subsequently exposed to the bile salts contained in the bile, which leads to the process of micellation. Two situations may arise depending on whether there is enough bile salt in proportion to cholesterol to complete this ""maturation"" process. If the cholesterol saturation is low, at equilibrium the bile salts will have completely micellized the vesicles. On the other hand, if bile is saturated with cholesterol, the micellation process is incomplete and vesicles and micelles will be present at equilibrium. The residual vesicle in this latter situation may have a higher cholesterol/phospholipid ratio because of the greater propensity of phospholipid to be micellized. This situation may result in cholesterol nucleation. The mechanism of nucleation from vesicles and the possible role of nucleating and antinucleating proteins in this process have been discussed. ",0
"Laser angioplasty: results of a prospective, multicenter study at 3-year follow-up. A prospective multicenter trial was initiated to evaluate the efficacy and safety of laser angioplasty. Laser recanalization was performed in 338 patients with arteriosclerotic femoropopliteal artery occlusions (average length, 8.5 cm). Neodymium-yttrium-aluminum-garnet lasers were used in combination with sapphire probe catheters. The initial recanalization rate was 85%. Complications were observed in 14% of the patients. Emergency surgery was required in 1.5%. The cumulative long-term patency rate of the successfully recanalized arteries was 80%, 70%, 62%, and 57% at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 and 3 years, respectively. The patency rates were not affected by the length of the occlusion and the long-term medication (platelet inhibition vs anticoagulation), but patients with a normal runoff had significantly better patency rates than those with reduced runoff (63% vs 52%, P less than .01). The study has shown that laser-assisted angioplasty is safe and at least as effective as conventional angioplasty. ",0
"Disseminated, nonmeningeal gastrointestinal cryptococcal infection in an HIV-negative patient. Gastrointestinal cryptococcosis is extremely rare, especially in patients with no involvement of the central nervous system. We describe a 63-yr-old man undergoing prednisone therapy for chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis who presented with peritonitis, colitis, and skin lesions. Pathological studies revealed necrosis and numerous cryptococcal organisms in the colon, omentum, and skin, and cultures yielded Cryptococcus neoformans. The patient died of multisystem organ failure following emergency exploratory surgery performed when he had onset of symptoms of a bowel perforation after an endoscopic biopsy. Clinicians should be aware that gastrointestinal cryptococcosis can occur in the absence of infection of the central nervous system or lungs, and that it may affect relatively healthy patients who are immunocompromised because of splenectomy, chronic liver disease, or steroid therapy.

"Therapeutic dilemmas associated with antenatally detected ovarian cysts. Fifteen instances of ovarian cysts detected antenatally are reported. Seven cysts more than 5 centimeters in diameter were treated surgically because of clinical signs, such as palpable abdominal mass, vomiting and abdominal distension. Seven cysts less than 5 centimeters in diameter, and one cyst more than 5 centimeters in diameter began to regress spontaneously within six months after birth. Because the pathophysiologic nature of neonatal ovarian cysts has not been elucidated and because the borderline between physiologic and pathologic factors is still unclear, we propose a more conservative approach in the management of neonatal ovarian cysts to avoid unnecessary operations.

"Nasolacrimal obstruction after inferior meatus nasal antrostomy. Transient epiphora following rhinoplasty or intranasal procedures is a common occurrence. Permanent nasolacrimal duct obstruction, however, is rare. This article documents four cases of nasolacrimal duct obstruction following intranasal antrostomy. Three patients were cured by dacryocystorhinostomy and a fourth refused surgery. The anatomy of the nasolacrimal duct in the inferior meatus has considerable variation. Although the duct typically opens in the inferior meatus immediately under the insertion of the inferior turbinate, the orifice can be a single hole, a slit, multiple holes, or a trough, and can be located anywhere from 30 to 40 mm dorsal to the anterior nares. We review the embryology and anatomy of the nasolacrimal orifice in the nose and make recommendations for safe surgery in the inferior meatus. ",0
"Itraconazole in opportunistic mycoses: cryptococcosis and aspergillosis. Striking results were obtained with oral itraconazole therapy in two opportunistic mycoses. Of 28 patients with cryptococcal meningitis, 18 achieved complete responses, including 16 of 24 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Other manifestations of cryptococcosis were similarly responsive. In aspergillosis 12 of 15 patients responded, including 8 of 10 immunocompromised hosts. These patients included those with invasive pulmonary disease (4/5), skeletal disease (2/2), pleural disease (1/2), and pericardial, sinus, mastoid, hepatosplenic, or nail disease (1/1). These results with itraconazole compare favorably to conventional (parenteral) therapy, and toxicity was minimal. This suggests that comparative trials are now in order. ",0
"Improved early detection of recurrence in prostatic carcinoma following hormonal therapy. Combined use of palpation and fine needle aspiration cytology. Fifty-nine hormonally treated prostatic carcinoma patients were prospectively followed by rectal examination and fine needle aspiration cytology at six-month intervals for periods ranging from six to one hundred twenty months (median follow-up 48 mos). The cytologic findings and clinical impressions were divided into four or five categories, respectively, ranging from benign to clearly malignant. Cytologic material and clinical descriptions suitable for evaluation were available for 306 follow-up examinations. Of these, 209 were cytologically benign (including 191 without and 18 with clinical evidence of malignancy). The remaining 97 examinations showed cytologic evidence of malignancy of which 50 were clinically apparent (51.5%). While the correlation of clinical and cytologic findings was good (91.4%) in cases with no evidence of disease activity, our findings indicate that many recurrences which are occult to clinical examination may be detected by cytologic examination.

"Surgical aspects of sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis. Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis (SEP) is associated with the administration of beta-blocking agents as well as continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. The predisposing factors in the latter group are recurrent peritonitis, presence of acetate in the dialysate, and antiseptics used during bag exchanges. We report a case of SEP following chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and review the literature on this benign yet potentially lethal condition. Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis frequently leads to intestinal obstruction, small-bowel necrosis, enterocutaneous fistulas, and malnutrition. There is a high incidence of anastomotic failure when a resection and primary intestinal anastomosis is performed in patients with SEP. Although SEP is not commonly reported in the surgical literature, its importance to surgeons is indicated by the fact that the overall mortality rate is close to 60% in patients with SEP who develop surgical complications.

"A multifocal schwannoma of the masseteric nerve causing hemicrania. A case is reported of schwannoma of the right masseteric nerve, invading the pterygopalatine fossa and the parapharyngeal space through the mandibular notch in a 61-year-old woman. The tumor in this case was composed of four various-sized interconnected nodules, simulating a string of beads. The tumor was the cause of the patient's chronic hemicrania, as confirmed by the relief from and disappearance of head pain after surgical removal of the tumor. The most important aspects of this case are the anatomic site of the schwannoma and its uncommon clinicopathologic manifestations; this tumor originated from the masseteric nerve and is the first case reported to straddle the mandibular notch.

"Treatment of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis with continuous intraventricular infusion of recombinant interleukin-2. A 42-year-old man developed leptomeningeal carcinomatosis 6 years after treatment of a malignant melanoma. He was treated with two courses of recombinant interleukin-2, administered as a continuous intraventricular infusion (6 X 10E5 U/24 h) during 5 days. During the first day of the first course he also received 5 X 10E9 lymphokine-activated killer cells intraventricularly. This gave rise to a severe elevation of intracranial pressure, with headaches and meningismus. During the second course no LAK cells were administered. This course was tolerated much better. The neurological status did not change during the treatment. Recombinant interleukin-2 levels were maintained at about 300 U/mL during both courses. ",0
"Delayed-onset dystonia due to perinatal or early childhood asphyxia. We report 10 patients with delayed-onset dystonia associated with perinatal asphyxia and 2 associated with asphyxia in childhood. In the perinatal group, the mean age of onset was 12.9 years. Among these patients, dystonia continued to progress for a mean of 7 years, and as long as 28 years. These patients had moderate motor disability; none was wheelchair-bound, and thus their prognosis was better than that of the childhood-onset idiopathic torsion dystonias. The most frequently beneficial drugs were anticholinergics. Since some of these patients closely resembled cases of idiopathic torsion dystonia, the prior occurrence of asphyxia should be used as a criterion of exclusion for that diagnosis. ",0
"Medical treatment and prevention of peptic ulcer disease. Many agents seem to be equally effective for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease. This is true despite the drugs' varied mechanisms of action, and this observation has caused investigators to shift their focus from aggressive to defensive factors when studying ulcer pathogenesis. Patients with a healed ulcer are always at risk for recurrence, and guidelines are available for management of these patients. Ulcer prevention becomes a crucial issue in intensive care units where critically ill patients have many known risk factors. Maintaining a gastric pH above 4.0 appears to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with such stress-induced ulcers. Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs increases ulcer risk and complications in the elderly, in women with rheumatoid arthritis, and in smokers and abusers of alcohol. Prophylaxis with the synthetic prostaglandin analogue misoprostol (Cytotec) appears to reduce this risk. ",0
"Radiographic identification by mastoid sinus and arterial pattern. A skull and some incomplete postcranial remains were discovered in two searches over a two-month period near Santa Fe, New Mexico. The discoveries could be demonstrated to be from the same person, and the remains were shown to be consistent with a specific missing person on the basis of anthropological analysis. Further work led to a positive identification on multiple grounds, including agreement of the details of the mastoid sinus and endocranial arterial patterns observed radiographically. These features may be useful for establishing positive identification from skeletal remains when antemortem radiographic studies for comparison are limited to lateral cranial vault studies. ",0
"Ovarian neoplasms and the risk of adnexal torsion. Previous reports examining adnexal torsion suggested that benign ovarian neoplasms are more likely to undergo torsion than malignant ovarian neoplasms. To our knowledge, this clinical observation has not been quantified. To examine this hypothesis, we reviewed our experience with ovarian neoplasms found at the time of surgery over a 10-year period. Benign ovarian neoplasms had a 12.9-fold increased risk of undergoing adnexal torsion when compared with malignant ovarian neoplasms (95% confidence interval, 10.2 to 15.9). The histologic type of ovarian neoplasm does not appear to affect the rate of adnexal torsion. Adnexal torsion rarely involves cancer. ",0
"585 nm for the treatment of port-wine stains. Although the flashlamp-pulsed-dye laser has been successfully used for the treatment of port-wine stains (PWS) at 577 nm, a number of adult patients had incomplete clearance of their birthmarks with this treatment modality because of residual vessels lying beyond the 0.75-mm penetration depth of 577-nm irradiation. Fifteen adult patients, of whom nine were previously treated with limited success at 577 nm (group A), and six untreated patients (group B) were included in the study. For the group A patients, treatment with 585 nm produced successful clearance of the birthmark. For the six patients in group B, parallel treatment of different sites of the same lesion coupled with skin biopsies and histologic examination revealed that a change in the wavelength from 577 to 585 nm allowed the laser light to penetrate from the midreticular dermis into the subcutaneous fat. This explained the clearance achieved at 585 nm and not at 577 nm. ",0
"Stress and sodium intake in neural control of renal function in hypertension. The interaction between genetic and environmental factors is important in the pathophysiology of hypertension. By examining the effects of two environmental factors--acute psychoemotional stress and dietary sodium intake--in rats with genetic hypertension, an important influence on central neural mechanisms governing the renal sympathetic neural control of renal function has been demonstrated. Additional studies of the central opioid systems have demonstrated an important role of opioid peptides in modulating the renal functional responses to acute psychoemotional stress. The observed renal functional alterations--antidiuresis, antinatriuresis, and renal vasoconstriction--are known to be capable of contributing to the initiation, development, and maintenance of the hypertensive process.

"Choledocholithiasis in Chinese immigrants with cholelithiasis. During the period from January 1987 to December 1989, admissions for biliary tract disease at the New York Infirmary--Beekman Downtown Hospital were split almost evenly between Chinese immigrants from southeast Asia and all other ethnic groups (Caucasian, Hispanic, black, et cetera). However, the incidence of choledocholithiasis in patients undergoing cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis was much higher in the Chinese immigrant population, 37.2 versus 11.8 per cent, a highly significant difference (p = 0.001). In addition, we often found the disease to be of greater severity in Chinese patients. They were more likely to have large numbers of stones in the duct and more likely to have significant ductal enlargement. This increased risk was essentially constant regardless of age. Because of this threefold risk of choledocholithiasis when operating on a Chinese immigrant from southeast Asia for cholelithiasis, intraoperative cholangiography is mandatory, even in those without other indications for common bile duct exploration.

"Oral findings in HIV-infected patients attending a department of internal medicine: the contribution of intraoral examination towards the clinical management of HIV disease The occurrence of oral mucosal lesions was studied in 70 consecutive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, including 35 patients with AIDS, who had been admitted to a Department of Internal Medicine. Lesions of the oral mucosa were observed in 52 patients (74 per cent). Oral candidiasis (50 per cent), hairy leukoplakia (14 per cent), periodontal disease (13 per cent), and oral Kaposi's sarcoma (4 per cent) were the most common lesions. Oral mucosal lesions suggestive of HIV infection were present in ten of 12 patients of unknown HIV status in whom Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia was suspected. Close cooperation between the medical and dental professions is recommended since accurate intraoral examination can make a valuable contribution towards the clinical management of HIV-infected patients and may influence the CDC classification of this disease.

"Isolated trigeminal sensory loss secondary to a distal anterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysm: case report. A previously healthy 25-year-old woman suddenly developed right-sided facial numbness and a headache. The neurological examination was within normal limits with the exception of meningismus and right-sided facial sensory loss. A computed tomographic scan and a magnetic resonance imaging study demonstrated an acute hematoma in the right cerebellopontine angle. A 4-vessel cerebral angiogram revealed no abnormalities. Posterior fossa exploration disclosed a large, partially thrombosed, fusiform anterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysm, which indented the pons at the trigeminal root entry zone. The aneurysm was excised, and the patient made an excellent recovery. She was left with a persistent trigeminal sensory deficit. Anterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysms are rare lesions that generally present with a cerebellopontine angle syndrome; occasionally, facial sensory loss is also a feature. Isolated trigeminal sensory findings, as illustrated in this case, are extremely unusual in posterior fossa vascular lesions. ",0
"Augmentation mentoplasty using Mersilene mesh. Many different materials are available for augmentation mentoplasty. However, the optimal implant material for chin implantation has yet to be found. During the past several years, a number of experienced surgeons have turned to the use of Mersilene mesh. Mersilene mesh is a non-absorbable Dacron polyester fiber that can be conformed easily into layers to achieve tailored dimensions and shape. At the McCollough Plastic Surgery Clinic PA, Birmingham, Ala, 277 patients over a 10-year period underwent chin augmentation with Mersilene mesh implants. The material provides excellent tensile strength, durability, and surgical adaptability. The overall complication rate was 3.2% (nine patients); infection rate, 2.5% (seven patients); and removal secondary to infection, 1.7% (five patients). Based on this 10-year experience, Mersilene mesh remains our material of choice for chin augmentation. ",0
"Magnetic resonance imaging of cardiac rhabdomyosarcoma. Quantifying the response to chemotherapy. This report illustrates the use of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to quantify the initial extent of a cardiac rhabdomyosarcoma and, more importantly, its response to chemotherapy. Image slices spanning the heart and adjacent structures were analyzed using Simpson's rule applied to the image slices to estimate the tumor volume initially, then after 5 weeks, and again after 4 months of chemotherapy. A substantial, progressive reduction in tumor volume during chemotherapy was shown. After chemotherapy was discontinued, an increase in tumor volume was shown. It is suggested that, in addition to being useful in patient care, the technique may be useful in clinical investigations by providing an objective, quantitative measure of tumor response to therapy.

"Multiple myeloma and acute megakaryoblast leukemia in spent phase polycythemia vera. The spontaneous and simultaneous occurrence of multiple myeloma and megakaryoblast leukemia with myelodysplastic features in a case of spent phase polycythemia vera is well documented. In support of the morphologic characteristics of the bone marrow, immunocytologic studies show proliferation of monoclonal plasma cells and megakaryoblasts. The cytogenetic findings of 20q- and unbalanced t(1;7) are consistent with myelodysplastic and leukemic transformation of the bone marrow. These transformations expand observations on variable and spontaneous lineage commitments as the consequence of alterations of the hematopoietic stem cell clone. These data are in support of the changing insights in hematopoiesis as a process of ordered commitment of the stem cell with sequential lineage potentials. ",0
"A complex ileovaginal fistula with associated obstructive uropathy in a patient with Crohn's disease: technical considerations and review of the literature. A high index of suspicion of an ileogenital fistula should be aroused by a patient with Crohn's disease, weight loss, malnutrition, and a persistent vaginal discharge. Preoperative gastrointestinal and genitourinary evaluation should be used in an attempt to localize the fistulous origin as well as concomitant fistulae. The principles of surgical therapy include preoperative ureteral catheters, resection of the diseased bowel and fistulous segment of bowel, and interposition of healthy tissue (ie, omentum) between the bowel anastomosis and the vaginal cuff.

"Suggestive evidence that pelvic endometriosis is a progressive disease, whereas deeply infiltrating endometriosis is associated with pelvic pain. In a 3-year prospective study of 643 consecutive laparoscopies for infertility, pelvic pain, or infertility and pain, the pelvic area, the depth of infiltration, and the volume of endometriotic lesions were evaluated. The incidence, area, and volume of subtle lesions decreased with age, whereas for typical lesions these parameters and the depth of infiltration increased with age. Deeply infiltrating endometriosis was strongly associated with pelvic pain, women with pain having larger and deeper lesions. Because deep endometriosis has little emphasis in the revised American Fertility Society classification and after analyzing the diagnoses made in each class, considerations for a simplifying revision with inclusion of deep lesions are suggested. In conclusion, suggestive evidence is presented to support the concept that endometriosis is a progressive disorder, and it is demonstrated that deep endometriosis is strongly associated with pelvic pain.

"Detection of somatic DNA alterations in ovarian cancer by DNA fingerprint analysis. The M13 phage single-strand DNA probe which recognizes highly polymorphic loci was applied to HinfI-digested DNA isolated from tumor tissue and peripheral leukocytes from 20 patients with ovarian cancer. An average of 22 minisatellite-containing DNA fragments were observed per individual. DNA fingerprint analysis revealed a change in restriction-fragment-length patterns in the DNA from 12 of 20 (60%) tumors compared with the patient's constitutional DNA. Deletion of one or more bands from the tumor was recognized by the probe in seven cases, new bands were identified in two, and intensity shift was demonstrated in eight. The authors conclude that the unmapped M13 minisatellite probe is a useful method for identifying cancer-related somatic DNA alterations. ",0
"Delayed facial nerve palsy after temporal lobectomy for epilepsy: report of four cases and discussion of possible mechanisms. Four cases of idiopathic peripheral facial nerve palsy were documented after 110 consecutive resections of the temporal lobe for intractable epilepsy. In 3 of the 4 cases, the palsy was ipsilateral to the side of the temporal lobectomy. The onset of facial weakness was delayed 7 to 13 days after surgery (mean, 9.7 days). One patient underwent facial electroneurography, which documented 17% of normal facial motor function at the height of his weakness and the absence of the acoustic stapedius reflex. All patients were treated with prednisone (60-80 mg per day by mouth for 10-14 days, tapering off throughout the subsequent week). Facial function recovered fully in all patients within 6 to 8 weeks. Possible mechanisms are discussed, including heat and/or mechanical trauma to the facial nerve near the geniculate ganglion during resection of mesial temporal lobe structures. ",0
"Small bowel enteroscopy: an early experience in gastrointestinal bleeding of unknown origin. Peroral small intestinal enteroscopy was performed in 35 consecutive patients with gastrointestinal bleeding of unknown origin by using a prototypic Sonde-type enteroscope. The median value for patient age was 69 years; duration of bleeding, 2 years (range, 2 months to 9 years); and transfusion requirements, 9 units. Bleeding was occult in 54% of these patients. Placement and passage of the enteroscope was performed by a gastrointestinal endoscopy assistant. Mean passage time was 4.3 hours. Complete passage was obtained in 14% of the patients, passage into the mid-distal ileum in 69%, and passage only into the jejunum in 17%. The diagnostic yield was 26%, with the majority of lesions encountered being mucosal vascular malformations. Small intestinal enteroscopy is a reasonable diagnostic procedure before embarking on visceral angiography and surgical exploration when standard endoscopic and radiologic methods fail to disclose a diagnosis.

"Malignant melanoma presenting as nasal obstruction. Mucosal melanomas arising in the nasal cavity are rare tumors comprising less than 1 percent of all melanomas. Often, the common clinical symptom is nasal obstruction. Grossly, they may or may not be pigmented and frequently attain large sizes. Histologic diagnosis of these tumors may be difficult, requiring immunohistochemical or electron microscopic confirmation. Aggressive surgical management is the treatment of choice in clinical stage I disease. Subsequent surveillance for recurrence is mandatory. Markers such as 5-S-cysteinyldopa may prove useful in staging, prognosticating, and postoperative surveillance for early recurrence, but their exact role has yet to be delineated. Ultimate prognosis is poor. ",0
"Cardiac echinococcosis: the diagnostic value of computed tomography scanning. The diagnosis of cardiac hydatid disease is a difficult one. Conventional and specific cardiac investigations are not pathognomonic of this disease. In this report, the diagnostic value of computed tomography (CT) scanning was prospectively investigated in seven patients. In five patients, the diagnosis was confirmed surgically. The CT-information obtained correlated accurately to the operative findings. In all the patients, CT-densities of the lesions were measured and were found to coincide with values of mean CT-densities of hydatid cysts elsewhere in the body. The capability of measuring tissue densities is unique to CT-scanning and have been emphasized in this report. ",0
"Impairment of sequences of memory-guided saccades after supplementary motor area lesions. Different paradigms of saccades were recorded electro-oculographically in 2 patients with infarction affecting the left supplementary motor area. Saccades made toward visual targets (visually-guided saccades) or away from them (antisaccades) were normal in both patients. Memory-guided saccades, made to the remembered position of a flash occurring 2 seconds before, were preserved in 1 patient and only slightly impaired in the other. However, sequences of two or three memory-guided saccades were severely impaired in both patients. It has previously been reported that the supplementary motor area plays an important role in programming sequential limb movements. Our data suggest that this area plays a similar role in the control of sequential eye movements. ",0
"Antenatal spontaneous perforation of the extrahepatic biliary tree. Spontaneous perforation of the biliary system is an unusual neonatal phenomenon that is rarely recognized at birth. To date, it has not been reported antenatally. A 16-year-old pregnant adolescent had an ultrasonogram at 25 weeks of pregnancy that revealed ascites in the fetus. After the infant was delivered at 32 weeks, a hepato-iminodiacetic acid scan showed a spontaneous rupture of the common bile duct. The infant was treated with external drainage of the biliary tree and recovered well. This case demonstrates that spontaneous perforations of the bile ducts can occur much earlier than the usually described 2 to 12 weeks after birth, can be diagnosed antenatally, and should be added to the list of causes of fetal ascites.

"Disseminated Pneumocystis carinii infection with hepatic involvement in a patient with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Extrapulmonary infection with Pneumocystis carinii (P. carinii) in AIDS patients is uncommon, and is often described only at postmortem examination. Although most antemortem cases involve spread to the bone marrow or spleen, P. carinii involvement of other organs has only recently been described. Despite the frequency of liver enzyme abnormalities in AIDS patients with a history of P. carinii pneumonia, P. carinii has been observed only rarely in the liver. We present a well-documented case of P. carinii involving the liver in an AIDS patient with P. carinii pneumonia and progressive liver enzyme abnormalities. We suggest that P. carinii infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of AIDS-related liver disease. ",0
"Delayed subcapsular hematoma after percutaneous liver biopsy as a manifestation of warfarin toxicity. Guidelines for the management of patients receiving chronic anticoagulation therapy who require liver biopsy are not clearly defined. In patients with normal coagulation, liver biopsy is a relatively safe procedure with a morbidity of less than 0.1% and a mortality of less than 0.01%. We report a patient with a prosthetic aortic valve who developed a large subcapsular hematoma 12 days after a percutaneous liver biopsy as a consequence of warfarin toxicity. Based on the experience with this patient, reinstitution of anticoagulant therapy should be avoided for at least 72 h after a percutaneous liver biopsy. Intravenous heparin should be resumed first, and warfarin added if no bleeding has occurred after an additional 48-72 h. The prothrombin time should be maintained at 1.5 times the baseline. ",0
"Pemoline-associated hepatic injury. Among 100 cases of hepatic injury attributed to the administration of pemoline, 43 had sufficient accompanying information to permit analysis. All but two patients were less than 20 years old, and 80% were less than 12 years old. Males predominated the study. Injury appeared as early as 1 week or as late as greater than 1 year of taking the drug. The injury was uniformly hepatocellular as judged by the high values for aminotransferases and by death in massive necrosis in one patient. Mechanism was judged to be idiosyncratic, and the idiosyncrasy was probably metabolic rather than immunologic. ",0
"Postmortem chorionic villus sampling is a better method for cytogenetic evaluation of early fetal loss than culture of abortus material. In utero chorionic villus sampling at the time of diagnosis of intrauterine fetal death is compared with more traditional use of cultured fetal skin, products of conception, or amniocentesis. A total of 102 specimens from early fetal losses were evaluated for success in karyotyping and chromosomal results. We found postmortem chorionic villus sampling is technically possible, offers the highest likelihood of getting a cytogenetic result, and is a rapid, reliable, and safe technique. The extraembryonic component of intrauterine fetal deaths appears to remain viable and continues to grow long after the embryo has died. Samples obtained at the time of diagnosis of fetal death offer the greatest changes of successfully obtaining a karyotype. The incidence of chromosome abnormalities associated with fetal loss, particularly trisomies, is higher than previous data suggested. ",0
Delayed pharyngoesophageal perforation: a complication of anterior spine surgery. Stabilization of the cervical spine is often accomplished via an anterior cervical approach. Bone grafts and/or plates and screws are used to achieve stabilization. Injuries to the pharynx and esophagus are known complications in anterior exposure of the cervical spine. These injuries are manifest in the early postoperative period. Reports of late perforations are very rare. We present four cases of delayed injury to the pharynx and esophagus that resulted in abscess or fistula. We postulate that graft displacement with resulting erosion was responsible for these serious complications. Postoperative odynophagia in patients who undergo anterior cervical fusion warrants evaluation of the bone graft location. Early surgical intervention and repair may decrease prolonged morbidity in these patients. ,0
"Reduction of mortality, sudden death and non-fatal reinfarction with beta-adrenergic blockers in survivors of acute myocardial infarction: a new hypothesis regarding the cardioprotective action of beta-adrenergic blockade. Beta-adrenergic blockers have been shown definitely to reduce the incidence of total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, sudden death and nonfatal reinfarction in survivors of an acute myocardial infarction. The mechanisms to explain this protective action of beta blockers have never been elucidated conclusively, and include the antiarrhythmic and myocardial oxygen demand-reducing effects of the drugs. An antithrombotic mechanism has also been suggested. However, beta blockers have relatively weak antiplatelet activity, suggesting that their antithrombotic effects may be related to prevention of coronary artery plaque rupture and the subsequent propagation of an occlusive arterial thrombus rather than direct anticoagulant action. The therapeutic ability of beta blockers to attenuate the hemodynamic consequences of catecholamine surges, may protect a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque from fracture, thereby reducing risk of coronary thrombosis, myocardial infarction and death.

"Diclofenac-associated hepatotoxicity Diclofenac sodium, a phenylacetic acid-derived nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) recently released in the United States, was associated with the development of significant hepatitis in seven patients, with one associated death. Signs and symptoms developed within several weeks of initiation of drug use and generally resolved 4 to 6 weeks following discontinuation of use of the drug. The only patient rechallenged with the drug developed a recurrence of her hepatic abnormalities. In one patient, fatal, fulminant hepatitis developed despite early withdrawal of the drug. Review of the European literature disclosed three additional fatalities associated with diclofenac therapy. It is unclear whether the incidence of hepatotoxicity is higher with this drug compared with other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Careful patient monitoring is advised, and prompt discontinuation of the drug is suggested when signs or symptoms of liver disease develop. ",0
"Simultaneous presentation of adenocarcinoma of prostate and transitional cell carcinoma of bladder. Simultaneous presentation of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder and adenocarcinoma of the prostate is not uncommon. Twenty-two patients were diagnosed as having simultaneous or concurrent presentation of prostate and bladder carcinomas between January 1970 and July 1986. The overall five-year survival was 40 percent, with patients presenting with prostate cancer doing better (50%) than those with bladder cancer (32%). Retrospective review of these cases suggests that primary therapy should be directed to the most advanced cancer. Incidental prostate cancer may be ""cured"" with a cystoprostatectomy and, when indicated, radiation therapy added postoperatively for the bladder cancer. Eleven patients presented with Stage A prostate cancer: 10 of the 11 were treated for their bladder cancer. Treatment was usually radical cystoprostatectomy with or without postoperative radiation. None died of prostate cancer. Patients presenting with advanced stage prostate cancer have had recurrence or have died of the cancer. ",0
"Etiologic importance of the intimal flap of the external carotid artery in the development of postcarotid endarterectomy stroke. A technically unsatisfactory end point (transition from the removed diseased plaque to normal distal intima) leading to an intimal flap of the external carotid artery has been identified as a source of perioperative stroke. The mechanism involves thrombus formation with retrograde propagation of the thrombus and subsequent embolization of the internal carotid artery. This report describes three cases illustrating this mechanism and methods of identification and correction. This mechanism of postoperative stroke adds further justification for the routine use of intraoperative surveillance studies to document the technical result of endarterectomy involving the internal and external carotid arteries. When an unsatisfactory end point is identified in the external carotid artery, it should be corrected with the same sense of concern as a similar finding in the internal carotid artery. ",0
"Total bladder replacement using detubularized sigmoid colon: technique and results. We performed total bladder replacement with a detubularized segment of sigmoid colon in patients after cystoprostatectomy. The surgical technique and long-term results in 27 patients are reported. This neobladder configuration compared favorably with other neobladder types regarding ease of construction. The surgical complications were acceptable. Initial reservoir function was good but improved further with time. After 1 year the capacity averaged 600 cc, pressures during filling and at capacity were low (average 12 and 16 cm. water) and emptying was satisfactory (residual urine 4 to 80 cc). All patients were continent during the day and 67% were continent at night without excessive voiding habits. Nighttime incontinence was further resolved in 2 patients by using the AMS 800 artificial sphincter around the bulbous urethra. The detubularized sigmoid is an excellent neobladder configuration after cystoprostatectomy. ",0
"Prostatic-type epithelium in urinary bladder. Clinical, histologic, and immunohistochemical study. Six cases of urinary bladder mucosa with prostate-type epithelium were studied clinically, morphologically, and immunohistochemically. All patients were male with an average age of fifty-three years; most presented with painless hematuria. Histologically, two types of lesions were observed, the polypoid located in various sites of the bladder wall and the flat lesion found in the bladder neck. Both lesions shared in common a prostatic-type and transitional surface epithelium while prostatic-type glands were prominent in the polypoid lesion. The prostatic-type epithelium was confirmed immunohistochemically by detection of prostatic specific antigen and prostatic acid phosphatase. Based on specific findings we considered the metaplasia as the most reliable histogenetic aspect. ",0
"Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. A retrospective review of 94 patients who had undergone anterior cervical discectomy and fusion was performed to analyze the result in patients who had a diagnosis of posterolateral spondylosis, disc herniation, or both. Although in 23 of 94 patients additional adjacent asymptomatic levels of spondylosis were noted, only the symptomatic levels were addressed in the 94 cases. Postoperatively two cases of dysphagia were noted, as well as a 4% pseudarthrosis rate. There was an 88% good or excellent result when no additional spondylosis was present, but only a 60% good or excellent result when just the symptomatic levels were addressed, leaving unoperated adjacent levels of spondylosis.

"Medical dissolution of gallstones. Clinical experience of d-limonene as a simple, safe, and effective solvent. Retained gallstones in the bile ducts account for 60-70% of all the cases of postcholecystectomy syndromes. A solvent d-limonene preparation was injected directly to the biliary system of 200 patients to dissolve or disintegrate the retained gallstones. The outcomes were: retained stones completely disappeared in 96 cases (48%); partial dissolution in 29 (14.5%); chelating agent was also used with partial dissolution in 16 (8%); ineffective in 59 (24.5%). To make this method more effective, several guidelines should be observed including an in vitro trial dissolution test. Cautious observation for possible side effects and frequent hepatic and pancreatic function tests during the treatment with this preparation also should be performed. ",0
"Iatrogenic saphenous neuralgia: successful therapy with neuroma resection. We report the case of a patient with saphenous neuralgia secondary to iatrogenic trauma resulting from bypass surgery in the femoral-popliteal region. Early symptoms of this condition were medial calf and ankle pain, with no findings of motor and reflex abnormalities. Exploration of the thigh 2 years later revealed a neuroma of the nerve in the distal dissection site, medial to the knee. Resection of the neuroma alleviated this condition. It is noted that saphenous neuropathy is seen as a spontaneous entrapment syndrome as well as a complication of orthopedic and vascular procedures performed on the medial area of the knee. Saphenous neuralgia is often not recognized by neurosurgeons. If the condition is intractable, it does respond to surgical therapy. ",0
"Endocrine function in children with human immunodeficiency virus infection. We sought to determine if failure to thrive in pediatric patients with the human immunodeficiency virus could be explained based on endocrine dysfunction. Fourteen human immunodeficiency virus-infected pediatric patients, all of whom had adequate nutritional status, underwent endocrine evaluation. Growth hormone and cortisol responses to glucagon stimulation were adequate. Despite this, eight of the 12 subjects had low somatomedin C levels. Although all patients were clinically and biochemically euthyroid, 36% (5/14) demonstrated elevated baseline and peak thyrotropin levels in response to thyroid releasing hormone, suggesting a state of compensated hypothyroidism. Although the importance of these findings is unclear, it is possible that subtle alterations of thyroid regulation may contribute to failure to thrive in some pediatric patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus and may represent a potentially correctable defect.

"Tissue-expanded radial forearm free flap in neck burn contracture. Neck contracture after burn injury can result in severe functional as well as aesthetic deformities. Contracture can recur even after wide and complete release and full-thickness skin grafting. Recurrence is partly due to the inherent difficulties in both early postoperative immobilization and the required long-term splinting. When adjacent tissues are also burned, adequate local tissue for reconstruction may not be available; therefore, free-tissue transfer may be necessary. The large surface area that is required after adequate release may be provided by tissue expansion before free-tissue transfer. In the case presented the use of tissue-expanded radial forearm free flap for the reconstruction of a recurrent neck contracture is described. ",0
"Current concepts of cholesterol transport and crystal formation in human bile. The presence of vesicles in human bile probably accounts almost entirely for the frequently observed, but hitherto unexplained, phenomenon of metastable cholesterol supersaturation. This, in turn, largely explains the prolonged stability of cholesterol solubilized in supersaturated human bile. Under certain overall compositional conditions for a supersaturated native bile, the vesicular phase in its contribution to total cholesterol transport also becomes supersaturated in cholesterol. Because of this, the vesicles also become unstable, leading to formation of cholesterol crystals. A simple but common example of one factor affecting composition in this way is concentration of total solutes, especially the biliary lipids. Conversely, dilution of bile (e.g., hepatic bile) markedly reduces the cholesterol saturation level in biliary vesicles. The result is that such vesicles become much more stable. Under these conditions, cholesterol crystal formation becomes unlikely and rarely, if ever, occurs. ",0
Auditory hallucinations and smaller superior temporal gyral volume in schizophrenia. Recent neuropathologic investigations in schizophrenia report smaller volume of medial temporal lobe structures. These findings are confirmed by preliminary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. Direct stimulation of lateral temporal lobe structures in the region of the superior temporal gyrus provokes hallucinations. The authors' MRI study of young schizophrenic patients demonstrates smaller volume of the superior temporal gyrus (an auditory association area) and of the left amygdala. Smaller size of the left superior temporal gyrus and left amygdala is not accounted for by smaller size of the overall brain or temporal lobe. Shrinkage of the left superior temporal gyrus is strongly and selectively correlated with severity of auditory hallucinations. ,0
"Uses and complications of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty. Uvulopalatopharygoplasty has become widely performed for chronic snoring and for cases of obstructive sleep apnoea. Unfortunately this operation is not without morbidity and complications. We report our results of a prospective series of 50 patients undergoing uvulopalatopharyngoplasty with a minimum follow-up of one year. Snoring was abolished in 18 (36 per cent) and substantially reduced in the remainder. Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, identified in 11 patients pre-operatively, was reduced in severity in all but three. Troublesome complications were seen in 18 (36 per cent) patients, namely intermittent velopharyngeal incompetence in five (10 per cent), pharyngeal dryness in 11 (22 per cent) and loss of taste in five (10 per cent). One patient had nasopharyngeal stenosis requiring correction. A cautious approach to this operation is required with rigorous case selection. The importance of full assessment and careful follow-up should not be underestimated. ",0
"Ten years' experience with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Up to January 1989, 171 patients were trained at our center on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), and 17 on continuous cyclic peritoneal dialysis (CCPD). Over 10 years, we have gained 5,068 patient-months experience. Patient survival was 60% and 31% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. In contrast, diabetics had a survival of 32% at 5 years. Major complications included 499 new episodes of peritonitis, 304 exit-site infections, 22 hernias, five bowel perforations, one hydrothorax, and three episodes of sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis. Our technique survival has been 62% and 40% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. We believe that CAPD is a viable dialysis technique for long-term treatment of chronic renal failure and it should be offered as an option to intermittent hemodialysis. ",0
"Central corpectomy for cervical spondylotic myelopathy: a consecutive series with long-term follow-up evaluation. Since 1984, a consecutive series of patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy has been treated by central corpectomy and strut grafting. This report focuses on 40 cases operated on between 1984 and 1987 and followed from 2 to 5 years. The perioperative complication rate was 47.5%, with a 7.5% incidence of persistent sequelae: severe C-5 radiculopathy in one patient, swallowing dysfunction in one, and hypoglossal nerve palsy in one. No single factor (age, duration of symptoms, or severity of myelopathy) was absolutely predictive of outcome; however, syndromes of short duration had the best likelihood of cure. Similar outcomes were associated, individually, with long duration of symptoms, age over 70 years, and severe myelopathy. After factoring a 5% regression of improvement, the long-term cure rate was 57.5% and the failure rate was 15%. Myelopathy worsening was not documented. ",0
"Evaluation of tumor progression by repeated fine needle biopsies in prostate adenocarcinoma: modal deoxyribonucleic acid value and cytological differentiation. Repeated fine needle aspiration biopsies of the prostate were taken during a period of 24 months or more from 84 patients with untreated prostate cancer. Serial followup regarding modal deoxyribonucleic acid values and cytological differentiation of the tumor cells was possible in 72 and 78 patients, respectively. During followup the modal deoxyribonucleic acid values in the tumor cells changed towards an increased aneuploidy in 17 patients and the cytological differentiation decreased in 18. These findings of a change in modal deoxyribonucleic acid values and cytological differentiation of prostate cancer cells during the course of untreated patients support the concept of a gradual dedifferentiation of prostate cancer.

"Neuropsychological aspects of learning disabilities in epilepsy. Cognitive impairment is regarded as the link between epileptic conditions and the inability to learn in school. The neuropsychological approach to learning disabilities in epilepsy, therefore, first concentrates on analyzing the differential effects of epileptic factors on cognitive function. The impact of seizure activity, localization of epileptogenic foci, and antiepileptic treatment on cognitive functioning can be evaluated based upon the results of continuous assessment with a computerized neuropsychological test system. Second, learning disabilities may be evaluated on observations made during classroom performance. Three issues seem to predominate in learning studies among disabled children with epilepsy: test-retest variability, deterioration, and the supposed specificity of the learning disabilities. ",0
"Flow cytometric DNA content of adenoid cystic carcinoma of submandibular gland. Correlation of histologic features and prognosis. Flow cytometric analysis of nuclear DNA content was performed in 26 adenoid cystic carcinomas of the submandibular gland using archived, paraffin-embedded tissues. The DNA content was compared with multiple histologic parameters and clinical course. Ten carcinomas (38%) were aneuploid and 16 (62%) diploid. Aneuploid carcinomas demonstrated a higher frequency of solid cytoarchitecture, lymph node metastases, and advanced clinical stage, as compared with diploid carcinomas. Other histologic features predicting aggressive clinical behavior also correlated with abnormal DNA content and included invasion of nerves larger than 0.25 mm and intravascular extension. Our data suggest that DNA content analysis can be an effective objective parameter in the clinicopathologic assessment of adenoid cystic carcinoma. ",0
"Ondansetron: a new entity in emesis control. Nausea and vomiting are serious problems for patients receiving cancer chemotherapy. Dopamine receptor and cholinergic receptor antagonism have been the target mechanism for agents used to combat drug-induced nausea and vomiting; more recently, blockade of serotonin receptors has been used for this indication. Current therapies are limited by extrapyramidal adverse effects, as well as drowsiness, sedation, respiratory depression, and cardiac effects. Ondansetron is an investigational serotonin antagonist that has documented effectiveness for cancer chemotherapy-induced emesis. Ondansetron appears to be well tolerated, with the possible exception of headaches and transient increases in liver enzymes. No extrapyramidal toxicities have been reported with this agent. While ondansetron looks promising, further studies are needed to fully define its role as an antiemetic. ",0
"Ultrasound in the investigation of the right iliac fossa mass. Patients presenting with a right iliac fossa (RIF) mass are a diagnostic problem. The objective of this study was to assess the role of ultrasound (US) in their investigation. A prospective series of 50 patients presenting with a clinically suspected RIF mass was examined by US and the finding correlated with the final diagnosis. There was a positive finding in 34 patients (68%). Ultrasound correctly identified the organ of origin in 33 (97%) and was able to guide the patients' further management. In 12 cases no abnormality was found in the RIF, of which 11 had no positive findings at follow-up and one was shown to have an unrelated abnormality at laparotomy. In four cases the findings were due to normal variants. Ultrasound is the imaging modality of first choice in patients presenting with a RIF mass. ",0
"Thrombosis in a congenitally bifurcated superior sagittal sinus. A 26-year-old woman had a peripartum venous thrombotic stroke involving the right parietal lobe. The initial thrombus was present only in the right channel of a congenitally bifurcated superior sagittal sinus. This diagnosis and subsequent thrombus extension were readily shown by magnetic resonance imaging in contrast to equivocal angiography. A subsequent, prospective review of 100 patients undergoing cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed the presence of similarly bifurcated superior sagittal sinuses in two. The patient stabilized after therapy with intravenous heparin, but switching her medication to oral warfarin sodium was followed by clinical deterioration and propagation of the thrombus, necessitating resumption of intravenous heparin. No coagulopathy was identified. ",0
"Association between neuroepithelial tumor and multiple intestinal polyposis (Turcot's syndrome): report of a case and critical analysis of the literature. We report a case of association of a brain tumor with multiple intestinal polyposis (Turcot's syndrome) and offer a critical analysis of the relevant literature with a view to revising the classification of the syndrome in relation to familial multiple polyposis and Gardner's syndrome. For this purpose, we considered only cases of intestinal polyposis associated with a primary neuroepithelial tumor (medulloblastoma, glioma, or glioblastoma) as originally described by Turcot. Differences emerged, depending on the central nervous system tumor type, which suggests that this neoplastic association may be classified as two distinct syndromes. ",0
"Unknown primary squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to the neck. We analyzed retrospectively 157 cases of metastatic neck squamous cell carcinoma from unknown primary sites, treated with surgery, radiotherapy, excisional biopsy, and combined modalities. Median follow-up was 74 months, and overall actuarial survival was 55% at 5 years. The surgery-treated group, despite a higher rate of manifesting primary tumors, had significantly better survival at 5 years compared with those receiving radiation therapy, of whom 23% had residual disease after treatment. Primary tumors were discovered during follow-up in 16% overall. Different treatments yielded comparable results in lower-staged neck disease (NX, N1, N2a), while surgery appeared more effective in controlling advanced disease (N2b, N3a). Factors that affected survival include neck stage, connective tissue invasion, and presence of recurrent or residual disease after treatment. ",0
"Natural death as viewed by the medical examiner: a review of 1000 consecutive autopsies of individuals dying of natural disease. A study of 1000 consecutive autopsies of individuals dying of natural disease was conducted. Cardiovascular disease was responsible for 60.9% of all deaths with coronary artery disease--not only the main cause of cardiovascular death but also the main cause of all natural deaths--accounting for 45.1% of such cases. Diseases of the central nervous and respiratory systems accounted for 8.7 and 8.6%, respectively, of the natural deaths. Seizure disorders and pneumonia were the main causes of death in these organ systems. There were 124 deaths of children less than one year in age, 91 of which were due to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). All of the SIDS deaths were in children less than 10 months old. ",0
"Carcinoma of the pancreas: a retrospective review. Eighty-five patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were reviewed in order to evaluate the efficacy of our methods of diagnosis and treatment. The most useful diagnostic test was percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) with a diagnostic rate of 96%. Pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure) and total pancreatic resection were performed in 13 and 2 patients, respectively. The remaining 50 patients underwent various palliative drainage procedures. Twenty patients did not undergo operation for various reasons. The primary tumor was found in the head of the pancreas in 50 patients (59%), the body in 6 patients (7%), and in the tail in 8 patients (9%). Postoperative complications, including sepsis, bleeding, intra-abdominal abscesses, and anastomotic leaks, occurred in 37% of the patients. There were one operative and 9 postoperative deaths. The average survival for those patients undergoing surgical intervention was 6 months. There were no 5-year survivors. ",0
"Threshold perimetry in tilted disc syndrome. Twelve consecutive patients (17 eyes) with tilted disc syndrome underwent quantified visual field examination with the G1 Octopus program (Interzeag AG, Schlieren, Switzerland). Visual fields were abnormal in all cases. Although field loss was more pronounced in the superotemporal quadrant (P less than .001), it also involved the other three quadrants, thus demonstrating that optic nerve hypoplasia in tilted disc syndrome is apparently not entirely sectorial. Linear regression analysis showed that an increase in mean defect correlated with increase in myopic refractive error (P less than .05). However, the increase in myopic refractive error was found to be related to a decrease in corrected loss variance (P less than .05), indicating that in tilted discs with higher myopia, field loss is more homogeneous. With this series of patients, short-term fluctuation was within normal ranges in all visual fields, showing that this may be an additional clue for differential diagnosis from acquired disorders. ",0
"Diabetes insipidus associated with craniopharyngioma in pregnancy. A case is presented of a pregnancy complicated by a suprasellar mass diagnosed at 27 weeks' gestation. This patient developed diabetes insipidus, which was successfully treated with 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone and ACTH stimulation tests were also abnormal, requiring the institution of thyroid and cortisol replacement therapy. The patient was delivered at 34 weeks' gestation secondary to worsening visual field testing. A craniotomy was performed in the postpartum period with removal of a craniopharyngioma. With successful medical treatment and careful observation, surgical intervention may be postponed until postpartum or until a gestational age with lower neonatal morbidity and mortality is reached.

"Femoral arteriovenous fistula as a complication of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. A report of five cases. Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) associated with invasive and diagnostic angiographic procedures is rare. The incidence is increased with procedures such as percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) but is still quite low. We report five cases of AVF within a 17-month period, representing 0.15 per cent of all cardiac catheterizations and 0.87 per cent of PTCAs. All five patients presented with groin bruits. There were two associated pseudoaneurysms and one patient with deep vein thrombosis. All patients underwent uneventful division of the fistula. A thorough understanding of the anatomy of the femoral triangle is necessary in order to avoid this complication. That all fistulas were in the superficial or profunda femoris arteries emphasizes the importance of avoiding a low groin puncture. Early angiography and surgical intervention are recommended for optimal results. ",0
"Monitoring of spinal cord stimulation evoked potentials during thoracoabdominal aneurysm surgery. Repair of a thoracoabdominal aneurysm involves a significant risk of ischemic injury to the spinal cord. Standard monitoring of somatosensory evoked potentials, which relies upon peripheral nerve stimulation, becomes nonspecific and insensitive during this surgery when aortic cross-clamping produces lower extremity ischemia causing a peripheral conduction block. Techniques for the insertion of percutaneous epidural electrodes, developed originally for pain management, have been adapted to this setting to permit direct stimulation of the spinal cord for intraoperative monitoring of evoked potentials. The clinical outcome in patients monitored by this technique has been consistent with evoked potential findings. ",0
"Comparison of pulse oximeters: accuracy at low arterial pressure in volunteers. A laboratory model was developed of limb hypoperfusion in volunteers, using parital occlusion of the brachial artery with consequent reduction in radial artery pulse pressure. This was used to compare the function of 13 pulse oximeters and the effect of reduced pulse pressure and mild hypoxia on these devices. With the exception of one device, all the pulse oximeters studied demonstrated similar accuracies at pulse pressures exceeding 20 mm Hg. There were however, significant differences between several of the pulse oximeters in both ability to display readings and accuracy of readings displayed when brachial artery occlusion reduced radial artery pulse pressures equal to or less than 20 mm Hg.

"Foreign bodies in the throat: a prospective study of 388 cases. We present the results of a prospective study of 388 patients presenting with a history of swallowing a foreign body. We indicate whether the patients' symptoms and signs were associated with a retained foreign body. While tenderness on palpation was an unreliable sign, pooling at indirect laryngoscopy invariably predicted a retained object. In many patients, initial careful examination of the oropharynx by casualty officers would have shown a retained fishbone in the tonsil or tongue and would have resulted in 16 per cent fewer radiographs and 17 per cent fewer referrals to the ENT department. Radiography only improved management in a small minority and 35 per cent of films were interpreted incorrectly by casualty officers. A follow-up barium swallow disclosed a pathological lesion in a significant proportion of patients with bolus obstruction, whether or not this was passed spontaneously. ",0
"Surgical voice restoration with the Blom-Singer prosthesis following laryngopharyngoesophagectomy and pharyngogastric anastomosis. Surgical voice restoration using the Blom-Singer technique is a well-established procedure in patients who have undergone simple laryngectomy. Operations for hypopharyngeal carcinoma are more extensive and require reconstruction using regional skin or myocutaneous flaps, or reanastomosis with colon, jejunum, or stomach. We report the use of the Blom-Singer prosthesis in four patients who had undergone pharyngogastric repair following laryngopharyngoesophagectomy and who had failed to achieve a satisfactory voice. All patients initially developed good speech using the prosthesis. Two patients subsequently had their prostheses removed: one because of recurrent malignant disease and one because the procedure had not significantly altered the quality of the voice. The remaining two patients have continued to use the device at 2 and 5 years after insertion with good voice production. ",0
"Dexamethasone increases plasma levels of albendazole. Therapy of neurocysticercosis with cysticidal drugs is frequently complicated by the exacerbation of symptoms that follows the inflammation triggered by the acute destruction of cysticerci. Treatment of such adverse reactions with dexamethasone is highly effective. However, it has been shown that dexamethasone lowers the plasma levels of praziquantel, thus reducing its cysticidal efficacy. We measured plasma levels of albendazole, another strong cysticidal drug, when dexamethasone was given simultaneously. We found that dexamethasone increased the plasma levels of albendazole by about 50% (P less than 0.002); hence, it seems that cysticercosis and the ensuing inflammation can be treated simultaneously with albendazole and dexamethasone without diminishing the efficacy of the cysticidal drug.

"Underlying illness associated with failure to thrive in breastfed infants. Over a four-year period in a suburban pediatric practice, 38 infants aged six months or less were identified with failure to thrive (FTT) while breast-feeding. In seven cases (18.4%), an associated organic illness was diagnosed. Only 2 of 28 breast-fed neonates (8%) were found to have FTT associated with another illness, as compared to 5 of 10 older infants (50%). Breast-fed infants with FTT, particularly those presenting after the first month of life, should be considered high risk for having other disease. Their clinical evaluation should include an appropriate search for organic illnesses. ",0
"Headache. Public health problem. Headache is, and apparently always has been, a frequent pain syndrome. It is reported in American and Western European societies in very high percentages of the population. Headache, and specifically severe headache, have also been reported as prevalent from a variety of societies worldwide, although prevalence rates have varied (they are very low, for example, in the People's Republic of China). Whether prevalence varies with different socioeconomic groups remains uncertain. Severe headache and specifically migraine is, for reasons still unknown, much more common in women, and, in most studies, is reported to decrease in prevalence in older age groups. Positive family histories are common, but the precise role of genetics is unknown. A major problem in the epidemiologic studies remains the difficulty of uniform definition of headache syndromes. ",0
"Outcome of patients with chronic affective disorder: a five-year follow-up. Patients with major depression, mania, or schizo-affective disorder that had been present without remission for 2 years or more at intake (N = 129) were followed prospectively for 5 years, as were 580 patients who had been ill for shorter periods at intake. Despite very substantial durations of episode, three-quarters of the chronic patients recovered, although recovery occurred much later in the follow-up period than it did among the nonchronic patients. Factors associated with recovery were less severe illness at intake, lack of psychotic features, good friendship patterns in adolescence, and, most important, a relatively high maximum level of functioning in the 5 years preceding intake.

"Irritant and sensitizing potential of copper, mercury and tin salts in experimental contact stomatitis of rat oral mucosa. HgCl2, CuSO4, SnCl2, SnCl4 or sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) were openly applied to rat oral mucosa for 1 min, followed 6 h later by histologic examination of the tissue response. Granulocytes were the predominant inflammatory cells and no lymphocytic infiltration could be seen with any of the substances tested. Irritant threshold levels were defined histologically for each of the substances. CuSO4 was found to be non-irritant at all concentrations. The addition of non-irritant concentrations of SLS lowered the threshold levels for HgCl2 and SnCl2, but CuSO4/SLS was non-irritant at all concentrations tested. Preapplication to the mucosa of SLS at non-irritant concentrations gave results with HgCl2, SnCl2 and CuSO4 similar to those with SLS added to the metal salt solutions. Lesions of allergic contact type could not be induced in the oral mucosa to any of the metal salt preparations. ",0
"A frameshift mutation leading to type 1 antithrombin deficiency and thrombosis. Type 1 antithrombin III (ATIII) deficiency, which is the commonest form of inherited ATIII defect, is characterized by a quantitative reduction in both immunologically and functionally detectable protein. This condition is associated with a high incidence of thromboembolic disorder. Previous investigations have shown that the ATIII genes in the majority of cases are grossly intact, but the precise underlying molecular defects remain unknown. We have investigated the molecular basis of a type 1 ATIII deficiency in an Italian kindred by enzymatic amplification of the ATIII gene sequences in affected family members and direct sequencing of the amplified genomic DNA. A novel mutation, the deletion of a single T in the second position of codon 119, was identified in each of the affected individuals. The resulting frameshift leads to a premature termination in codon 126, effectively resulting in a null allele. ",0
"Factors related to treatment resistance in hypertension. Hypertension which is resistant to treatment carries a relatively bad prognosis. Factors associated with treatment resistance were examined in a case-control study in a hospital hypertension clinic. Patients with resistant hypertension had more severe hypertension and more frequently had evidence of end-organ damage on presentation to the clinic. The prevalence of accelerated phase hypertension, renovascular disease and impaired renal function was also higher in these patients. Cigarette smoking, and the combination of cigarette smoking and heavy caffeine use, were greater in patients with resistant hypertension. Resistant hypertension did not appear to be associated with older age, obesity, regular alcohol use, various psychological factors or non-compliance. These findings support an aggressive investigation policy in resistant hypertension, and underline the harmful effects of cigarette smoking to hypertensive subjects. ",0
"Intraoperative protection of cranial nerves and perforating arteries by silicone rubber sheets. Technical note. The authors describe a technique whereby, during microneurosurgery, vital structures are covered or wrapped with small pieces of silicone rubber sheeting to protect them from intraoperative injury. In this way, perforating arteries located behind a large aneurysm can be covered to avoid their inclusion within the blades of the clip, and the cranial nerves coursing around or through a tumor can be wrapped to protect them from injury by a suction or forceps. By insulating nerves and arteries, this silicone rubber sheet has the added advantage of protecting them from injury due to electrical current of bipolar forceps. The silicone rubber sheet described here is smoother, thinner, and lighter than a cotton pattie. ",0
"Tumor factors predicting for prognosis in metastatic breast cancer. The presence of P24 predicts for response to treatment and duration of survival. Fifty-one patients with metastatic breast cancer were investigated to determine tumor parameters with prognostic significance. Investigations included determinations of P24 content by immunocytochemical means using a monoclonal antibody to P24 protein; immunocytochemical analysis of estrogen and progesterone receptors; ploidy analysis by flow cytometry, and histologic grading. There were significant correlations between the presence of P24 and estrogen receptor, between histologic grade and P24 expression, and between estrogen and progesterone receptors. Of the tumor factors investigated only P24 protein was, however, of prognostic significance. Patients with P24-positive tumors had a significantly higher rate of response to treatment as well as more prolonged duration of response and duration of survival from diagnosis of metastatic disease. None of the other variables investigated were significantly predictive of outcome. P24 protein may be a useful predictor of prognosis in metastatic breast cancer. ",0
"Immunohistochemical interpretation of early epithelial disorders of pyriform sinus. Expression of cytokeratins (CKs) was investigated immunohistochemically by use of monospecific monoclonal anti-CK antibodies in normal epithelia of pyriform sinus and epithelial lesions such as simple hyperplasia, different degrees of dysplasia, in situ carcinoma, and invasive carcinoma. In normal epithelium, strong expression of CK-19 was consistently observed only in the basal layer as basic CK, while expression of CK-13 showed a completely reverse pattern, being expressed only in suprabasal layers as stratification-related CK. Characteristic changes in expression pattern of these two CKs were observed in accordance with the degree of epithelial disorders and differentiation of carcinoma. Cytokeratin 1, as keratinization-associated CK, was observed only in keratinized cells of hyperplastic epithelia and well-differentiated carcinomas. These findings may be useful in evaluating epithelial disorders and classifying carcinomas more objectively, and may assist earlier detection of carcinoma when used with standard histologic techniques.

"T cell receptor peptide therapy triggers autoregulation of experimental encephalomyelitis. Encephalitogenic T cells specific for myelin basic protein share common V beta 8 peptide sequences in their T cell receptor (TCR) that can induce autoregulatory T cells and antibodies that prevent clinical signs of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). It is not known, however, if TCR peptides can treat established disease. To test its therapeutic value, TCR-V beta 8-39-59 peptide was injected into rats with clinical signs of EAE. This treatment reduced disease severity and speeded recovery, apparently by boosting anti-V beta 8 T cells and antibodies raised naturally in response to encephalitogenic V beta 8+ T cells. These results demonstrate that synthetic TCR peptides can be used therapeutically, and implicate the TCR-V beta 8-39-59 sequence as a natural idiotope involved in EAE recovery. Similarly, human TCR peptides may be effective in enhancing natural regulation of autoreactive T cells that share common V genes. ",0
"Modeling human performance in running. This paper focuses on the characteristics of a model interpreting the effect of training on athletic performance. The model theory is presented both mathematically and graphically. In the model, a systematically quantified impulse of training produces dual responses: fitness and fatigue. In the absence of training, both decay exponentially with time. With repetitive training, these responses satisfy individual recurrence equations. Fitness and fatigue are combined in a simple linear difference equation to predict performance levels appropriate to the intensity of training being undertaken. Significant observed correlation of model-predicted performance with a measure of actual performance during both training and tapering provides validation of the model for athletes and nonathletes alike. This enables specific model parameters to be estimated and can be used to optimize future training regimens for any individual. ",0
"Decreased local toxicity with subcutaneous diamorphine (heroin): a preliminary report. We report the cases of 5 patients who developed severe local toxicity during the subcutaneous administration of morphine sulphate and hydromorphone hydrochloride. All patients required site changes more frequently than once every 24 h due to redness, swelling, or pain while receiving morphine or hydromorphone. All patients showed prolongation in the duration of sites of infusion once an equianalgesic dose of diamorphine hydrochloride (heroin) was started. No change in pain control or systemic toxicity was detected with diamorphine. These findings suggest that diamorphine could be a useful alternative for patients who develop severe toxicity to subcutaneous morphine or hydromorphone. ",0
"Comparison of methods for checking surgical margins. Surgical margins of a cutaneous neoplasm can be evaluated by various combinations of three major types of sections: vertical (perpendicular), horizontal (parallel), and oblique (Mohs method). Vertical sections may run transversely through tumor (breadloaf method), longitudinally through tumor (breadloaf-cross method), or peripheral to the tumor. The peripheral (perimeter) sectioning methods are the only methods that can evaluate almost 100% of the margin, but they have the disadvantage of not showing the relationship of the tumor to its margin, which can be seen clearly with the vertical transverse sections. Seven methods of checking surgical margins are compared and contrasted. None of these is judged to be perfect or best. ",0
"Hyperfunctioning metastatic follicular thyroid carcinoma in Pendred's syndrome. A 66-year-old woman with Pendred's syndrome underwent a partial thyroidectomy when she was 17 years old. At the age of 52 years, she had a second thyroid operation because of hyperthyroidism due to a toxic multinodular goiter with a mediastinal extension consisting of several separate nodules. Five years later a hyperfunctioning metastatic follicular carcinoma was diagnosed histologically. After treatment with radioactive iodine, the patient was well. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first description of a metastatic follicular thyroid carcinoma in Pendred's syndrome and the first report of hyperthyroidism occurring after malignant degeneration of a dyshormonogenetic goiter.

"Premature menopause because of an inherited deletion in the long arm of the X-chromosome. A family is described in which both a mother and an infertile daughter had premature menopause at the ages of 31 and 28 years, respectively. Initially, an extensive investigation revealed no apparent cause for their conditions. However, when cytogenetic analysis in the daughter was performed, a terminal deletion in the long arm of one of the X-chromosomes was found. The karyotype was: 46,Xdel(X),(q25-qter). Chromosomal investigation in the mother showed an identical deletion. The karyotype of the patient's 35-year-old sister is normal. She has a normal menstrual cycle and two normal children. The presence of such familial cases suggests that chromosomal investigation should be considered in young women with oligomenorrhea, especially those whose mothers have experienced a premature menopause.

"The effects of rate, sequencing, and memory on auditory processing in the elderly. Auditory sequencing, rate, and memory were evaluated in three age groups with a series of subtests that require the identification of tones (Repetition Test; Tallal & Piercy, 1973). The older elderly group (M age = 80), but not the younger elderly group (M age = 70), performed significantly (p less than .05) poorer than the young adult group (M age = 25) when auditory memory of 4 and 5 tones was required and when the interstimulus interval was decreased. Performance was not related to hearing sensitivity, thus suggesting that changes in the auditory mechanism that occur with age may encompass more than a loss of hearing sensitivity. Moreover, performance on the Repetition Test did correlate with memory for digits, which indicates a relationship between auditory processing and higher cortical functions. ",0
"A possible role for antiphospholipid antibodies in acquired cardiac valve deformity. We studied the frequency of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in patients undergoing cardiac valve replacement, and present the results in the context of the pathology of the valve lesions. Forty-eight consecutive patients undergoing valve replacement were studied. Of the whole group, 15 (31%) had antibody levels greater than 2 SD above the mean for a control group of healthy persons and 11 (23%) had a level of greater than 3 SD. There was an increased frequency of elevated antibody levels in patients with valves showing fibrocalcific change and a significant association between aPL and valve thrombus. The possible role of these antibodies in the pathogenesis of the valve lesions is discussed. ",0
"The ""numb cheek-limp lower lid"" syndrome. A patient developed isolated numbness, 1st confined to the lateral nose and upper lip, but later involving the cheek, lower lip, upper gingiva, and the palate. This numbness was later associated with paresis of the muscles of the upper lip and angle of the mouth and with ipsilateral lower lid droop (the ""numb cheek-limp lower lid"" syndrome). Squamous cell carcinoma was discovered infiltrating the infraorbital nerve and distal branches of the facial nerve. Cheek numbness associated with lower eyelid or upper lip weakness may herald a neoplasm affecting the infraorbital nerve and distal facial nerve branches. ",0
"Bleeding gastroesophageal varices: gastric vein embolization after partial portal decompression. Shunts that decompress the portal vein are effective in the treatment of bleeding esophageal varices. Use of large-caliber portacaval shunts, however, results in the complete decompression of the portal system and the risk of subsequent development of hepatic encephalopathy. Use of small-caliber portacaval shunts results in mild portal hypertension and less frequent hepatic encephalopathy but may increase the risk of recurrent bleeding. Thirty-three patients underwent angiography after partial decompression portacaval shunting (median trans-shunt pressures, 8 mm Hg). Embolization of residual varices, noted in 13 patients, was performed. Results included one complication with no sequelae and no bleeding a mean of 13 months after the procedure was performed. Trans-shunt embolization of esophageal varices effectively prevents bleeding varices after partial portal decompression. ",0
"Nitrite from inflammatory cells--a cancer risk factor in ulcerative colitis? Elevated levels of luminal nitrite and a lowered luminal pH were found in 77 percent of patients with acute ulcerative colitis. No luminal nitrite was found in healthy control subjects. Nitrites are a secretory product of activated macrophages and neutrophils of the lamina propria, whereas the lowered luminal pH is due to diminished bicarbonate formation by impaired colonocytes. A hypothesis is put forward that nitrites, lowered pH, and bacterial amines are conducive to formation of carcinogenic n-nitroso compounds, which reflect a cancer risk in patients with ulcerative colitis dependent on the type and extent of inflammatory cell activation as well as metabolic impairment of colonic epithelial cells.

Open reduction and fixation of proximal humeral fractures and fracture-dislocations. Open reduction and internal fixation was employed in the treatment of 25 severely displaced fractures and fracture-dislocations of the proximal humerus. Our aims were accurate reduction and stable fixation to allow early mobilisation and to achieve full functional recovery. In 15 fractures an AO T-plate was used and in 10 a bent semitubular plate was employed as a blade plate. Excellent or satisfactory results were obtained in all six patients with two-part fractures involving the surgical neck; in four of the five patients with three-part fractures involving the surgical neck and tuberosities; in nine of the 11 patients with fracture-dislocation; and in two of the three patients with split fractures of the humeral head. Overall results were good or satisfactory in 21 of the 25 cases. Unsatisfactory results were associated with rotator cuff damage. ,0
"Local failure and related complications after definitive treatment of carcinoma of the prostate by irradiation or surgery. The authors review their institution's experience with the failure of definitive treatment to achieve local tumor control and with the distant dissemination and local morbidity associated with such failure. The causes of local failure are various: incomplete resection, implantation of spilled cells, and, possibly, selective implantation of circulating tumor cells in traumatized tissues after surgery and totally or partially resistant cells, new tumors, or radiologic misses after radiation. Treatment of local failure may be prophylactic or therapeutic and differs depending on the stage of the disease. Failure to control the tumor locally in the presence of distant metastases does not alter the length of survival, but it can profoundly affect the quality of survival. ",0
"In vivo rheologic effects of lipid apheresis techniques: comparison of dextran sulfate LDL adsorption and heparin induced LDL precipitation. The effects of two different LDL apheresis techniques, heparin-induced LDL precipitation (HELP) and dextran sulfate LDL adsorption (DSA), were compared in six patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. Total and LDL cholesterol were effectively lowered with both techniques. The reduction of serum triglycerides was more pronounced with DSA, whereas the reduction of HDL cholesterol was more pronounced with HELP. Single sessions using both techniques immediately reduced whole blood and plasma viscosity, as well as erythrocyte aggregation. Serum fibrinogen decreased by 62% (HELP) and 11% (DSA). Maintenance lipid apheresis administered 1 time per week resulted in a sustained reduction of total and LDL cholesterol and was associated with a sustained improvement in blood flow properties. Data suggest that besides serum fibrinogen, serum lipoproteins may adversely effect the rheologic characteristics of blood. ",0
"Magnetic resonance imaging in motor neuron disease. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was evaluated in 20 patients with motor neuron disease (MND) and in a control group of 11 healthy people. Bilateral increased signal areas of various sizes in the centrum semiovale, corona radiata, internal capsule, pedunculi of midbrain, pons, medulla and even in the frontal lobe, topographically related with the corticospinal tract, were found in 8 out of 20 patients. Three out of 4 patients with progressive bulbar paralysis and 5 out of 11 cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis had abnormal MRI. Such MRI abnormalities have neither been found in patients with progressive muscular atrophy nor in controls, suggesting that they may be the hallmark of pyramidal tract degeneration in motor neuron disease.

"The medical necessity of evaluation and treatment of port-wine stains. New lasers and improved laser delivery systems have allowed for the safe and effective treatment of port-wine stains in patients of all ages. The satisfactory results obtained by laser treatment have increased the number of patients seeking consultation regarding their birthmarks. It is imperative that physicians recognize the various medical syndromes and problems associated with port-wine stains. A review of 415 patients with facial port-wine stains has revealed hypertrophy and/or nodularity in 65% of patients by the fifth decade of life, which increases significantly the morbidity of these lesions. It is believed that laser treatment will minimize the medical and psychologic complications that result from the natural evolution of port-wine stains. ",0
"Rotavirus-specific antibody response in saliva of infants with rotavirus diarrhea. The reliability of saliva as an indicator of rotavirus infection was assessed among 15 infants (3-12 months) with rotaviral and 15 with nonrotaviral diarrhea. Paired salivary samples collected during acute and convalescent phases were tested for rotavirus-specific IgA and IgM by an ELISA. The sensitivity of IgA or IgM alone to predict infection was 53.3% and 46.6%, respectively; used in conjunction, the sensitivity rose to 80%. It seems that infants with rotaviral diarrhea mount mucosal antibody responses as reflected in their saliva; possibly salivary antibodies could be used to evaluate vaccine ""take"" in rotavirus vaccine trials.

"Fresnel prisms improve visual perception in stroke patients with homonymous hemianopia or unilateral visual neglect. We randomly assigned 39 patients with stroke and homonymous hemianopia or unilateral visual neglect to treatment with 15-diopter plastic press-on Fresnel prisms (n = 18) or to serve as controls (n = 21). Baseline evaluations of visual perception and activities-of-daily-living (ADL) function were similar for both groups. After 4 weeks, the prism-treated group performed significantly better than controls on the following: (1) Motor Free Visual Perception Test; (2) Line Bisection Task; (3) Line Cancellation Task; (4) Harrington Flocks Visual Field Screener; and (5) Tangent Screen Examination. There was no significant difference in Barthel ADL assessment at 4 weeks. Thus, treatment with 15-diopter Fresnel prisms improves visual perception test scores but not ADL function in stroke patients with homonymous hemianopia or unilateral visual neglect. ",0
"Echocardiographic diagnosis of a ruptured aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva: operation without catheterisation in seven patients. A ruptured aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva was diagnosed by Doppler, colour, and cross sectional echocardiography in a consecutive series of seven patients. The diagnoses were confirmed at operation without cardiac catheterisation. Examination by pulsed and continuous Doppler echocardiography showed continuous turbulence in six patients with aneurysms rupturing into the right ventricular outflow tract and in the patient with rupture of an aneurysm of the non-coronary sinus into the right atrium. Colour Doppler echocardiography showed turbulent flow across the defects in all seven patients. A ventricular septal defect with aortic regurgitation was detected in one patient and an associated ventricular septal defect in another. Doppler, colour, and cross sectional echocardiography were useful non-invasive techniques for diagnosing a ruptured aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva without the need for cardiac catheterisation. ",0
"Gross motor patterns in children with cerebral palsy and spastic diplegia. Rolling, sitting, and crawling patterns were motoscopically analyzed in 72 children with cerebral palsy and spastic diplegia; the relation between these patterns and the severity of the locomotive disability was studied. In rolling, trunk rotation and elbow support were difficult for the most severely diplegic children. When sitting, most patients had a between-heel sitting pattern in which the thighs were adducted and the knees were flexed. When crawling, the reciprocal thigh movements were insufficient and accompanied by lateral bending of the trunk in many patients. In the more impaired patients, the thighs supported the weight in flexion and did not move reciprocally. Creeping on the elbows without reciprocal leg movements was demonstrated in the most severely affected children after 2 years of age. ",0
"Detection of hepatitis B virus DNA by polymerase chain reaction in plasma of volunteer blood donors negative for hepatitis B surface antigen. Plasma samples from 206 volunteer blood donors were tested for hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA by dot blot hybridization and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All donors were negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and had normal serum alanine aminotransferase levels. None of the 206 plasma samples was positive for HBV DNA by dot blot hybridization assay. However, nine samples were positive for HBV DNA by PCR using two primer pairs specific for surface and core regions. Nine persons received the HBV-DNA-positive plasma, and one developed posttransfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis; the others remained well 6 months later. Therefore, approximately 4% of blood donors in Taiwan have low titers of HBV DNA, and a more sensitive method to screen donors may be needed in the future, although the current serologic test remains the most practical at present.

"Stroke rehabilitation: a geropsychological perspective. Rehabilitation medicine and geriatric medicine are similar in their concern for functional improvement in the face of chronic medical conditions. Although many patients served by rehabilitation medicine fall within the geriatric age range, a knowledge of normal aging does not necessarily inform clinical decision making or research practices in rehabilitation. Using stroke as an example of a disorder affecting primarily geriatric patients and requiring the technology of rehabilitation, ways in which age might affect assessment of outcome are examined. Three areas dealing with conceptual and methodologic issues--depression, neurochemical interventions, and family--are highlighted. The final section outlines recommendations for research on rehabilitation outcome of geriatric stroke patients. ",0
"A placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, two-center, pilot trial of Cop 1 in chronic progressive multiple sclerosis. We found Cop 1 to be effective and relatively safe in a previous (exacerbating-remitting) clinical trial. This current trial involves 106 chronic-progressive patients. The major end point, confirmed progression of 1.0 or 1.5 units (depending on baseline disability) on the Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale, was observed in nine (17.6%) treated and 14 (25.5%) control patients. The differences between the overall survival curves were not significant. Progression rates at 12 and 24 months were higher for the placebo group (p = 0.088) with 2-year probabilities of progressing of 20.4% for Cop 1 and 29.5% for placebo. We found a significant difference at 24 months between placebo and Cop 1 at one but not the other center. Two-year progression rates for two secondary end points, unconfirmed progression, and progression of 0.5 EDSS units, (p = 0.03) are significant. ",0
"Pharmacokinetics of paracetamol after cardiac surgery. Plasma concentration was measured after rectal and nasogastric administration of paracetamol 15 mg/kg to 28 febrile children aged between 9 days to 7 years who had undergone cardiac surgery. After equivalent doses, rectal administration in neonates and children on the first postoperative day was found to produce plasma concentrations below the therapeutic range with higher concentrations after nasogastric paracetamol on the second postoperative day. There was less variance in plasma paracetamol concentrations in neonates. Both plasma elimination half life and area under the plasma concentration time curve were significantly increased in neonates after suppository dosing compared with older children. There was no difference in antipyretic effect between the two routes of administration, but this was much lower than that previously reported in febrile children. ",0
"Transcranial stab wounds: morbidity and medicolegal awareness. In this series of eight patients with transcranial stab wounds, the importance of classifications of such wounds as a separate traumatic entity is stressed. The mechanisms of neuronal and vascular damage in these wounds are discussed and are found to be specific from other head injuries. Cerebral injury by stabbing is largely restricted to the wound tract. Frontal stabs (two cases) are accompanied by the least morbidity and mortality, while temporal stabs (four cases) are more commonly fatal. In transorbital stabs (two cases) carotid-cavernous fistulae resulted. Early recognition, administration of antitetanus serum and antibiotics, and debridement may minimize complications. ",0
"US-assisted aspiration thrombectomy: in vitro investigations. The authors describe the use of a new ultrasound (US)-aspiration thrombectomy technique. An oscillating US probe was inserted into a thin-walled, large-bore aspiration catheter. Experiments tested the ability of the new device and other catheter combinations to remove clot material from a Petri dish, as well as from small and large vessel models made of silicone and glass tubes, respectively. Results of the experiments demonstrated that an oscillating 1.0-mm US probe inserted into an aspiration catheter (7-9 F in diameter) promoted clot fragmentation and allowed continuous aspiration of thrombi of any size. When compared with simple large-bore catheter aspiration and with mechanical fragmentation by means of a US probe within a catheter that was flushed to cool the probe, US-assisted aspiration thrombectomy demonstrated significantly better results for percutaneous transcatheter removal of fresh thrombi.

"Conservation surgery for glomus jugulare tumors: the value of early diagnosis. The results of lateral cranial base surgery for glomus jugulare tumors are gratifying when normal anatomy and function can be preserved. The goal of conservation surgery is to preserve normal ear anatomy and cranial nerve function. In general, conservation surgery is tumor-size dependent. Thus, excellent states of functional recovery depend upon accurate early diagnosis. This paper reviews the technical aspects of transtemporal conservation skull base tumor surgery while also reviewing our experience with nearly 100 glomus jugulare patients. Adjuvants to early diagnosis will be highlighted from a review of presenting symptoms, clinical signs, and related diagnosis. Our objective is to provoke a high index of suspicion in physicians charged with the responsibility of diagnosing these tumors. Diagnostic guidelines are proposed. ",0
"Itraconazole therapy for nonmeningeal coccidioidomycosis: clinical and laboratory observations. Itraconazole, a new oral triazole antifungal agent, was administered in 75 courses to patients with chronic coccidioidomycosis at dosages of 50 to 400 mg/day for a median duration of 10 months. Assessment of efficacy was made with a standardized scoring system. Responses were seen in 42 of 58 assessable courses (72%). Nonresponse occurred exclusively in patients who had failed previous therapy and was most common in pulmonary disease. Toxicity was minimal at the doses studied. Pharmacokinetic analysis of itraconazole in serum at steady state showed negligible circadian variation; differences in serum concentrations among patients were large. Clinical isolates of Coccidioides immitis showed uniform in vitro susceptibility to itraconazole. Itraconazole shows impressive activity in this series of patients with refractory coccidioidomycosis. Further evaluation of itraconazole in this and in other systemic mycoses is in order. ",0
"Delayed subcapsular hematoma after percutaneous liver biopsy as a manifestation of warfarin toxicity. Guidelines for the management of patients receiving chronic anticoagulation therapy who require liver biopsy are not clearly defined. In patients with normal coagulation, liver biopsy is a relatively safe procedure with a morbidity of less than 0.1% and a mortality of less than 0.01%. We report a patient with a prosthetic aortic valve who developed a large subcapsular hematoma 12 days after a percutaneous liver biopsy as a consequence of warfarin toxicity. Based on the experience with this patient, reinstitution of anticoagulant therapy should be avoided for at least 72 h after a percutaneous liver biopsy. Intravenous heparin should be resumed first, and warfarin added if no bleeding has occurred after an additional 48-72 h. The prothrombin time should be maintained at 1.5 times the baseline. ",0
"Long-term results of the Belsey Mark IV antireflux operation in relation to the severity of esophagitis A retrospective analysis of the results of the Belsey Mark IV operation has been conducted, relating these to the degree of esophagitis present preoperatively. Analysis of 89 patients showed a 91.7% success rate in patients without esophagitis. Good results diminished steadily as the severity of esophagitis increased, giving 76.5%, 75%, 66.7%, and 50% success rates for first-, second-, third-, and fourth-degree esophagitis, respectively. We believe that shortening of the esophagus is an important factor in this. Shortening is obvious in third- and fourth-degree esophagitis but subtle in first- and second-degree esophagitis. We conclude that the Belsey operation is adequate for patients without esophagitis, but for patients with any degree of esophagitis more effective reflux control is needed. ",0
"Patterns of resource consumption in medical intensive care Intensive care is being scrutinized as a major factor in increasing health care costs. We examined 404 consecutive admissions to the medical ICUs at a university medical center to study patterns of consumption of ICU resources and the proportion of resources used by patients admitted for monitoring only. We found a skewed distribution of ICU resource consumption, with the ""high-cost"" 8 percent using as many ICU resources as the ""low-cost"" 92 percent. Forty-one percent of admissions did not receive acute ICU treatments, but these admissions consumed less than 10 percent of ICU resources. Reducing the number of patients admitted for monitoring will have a relatively small impact on hospital charges. Since over 70 percent of the high-cost patients died, improved understanding of prognosis and better physician-patient communication may substantially reduce the proportion of critical care resources expended on futile treatment.

"Preanaesthetic medication with clonidine. The purpose of this study was to evaluate oral clonidine in a dose of 0.3 mg as a routine premedicant. Sixty-nine normotensive female patients were studied in a randomized double-blind investigation in which clonidine was compared with an inert treatment. Clonidine produced a significant reduction in anxiety (P less than 0.05) and sedation and a reduction in the sleep dose of methohexitone (P less than 0.05). Tachycardia in response to intubation was attenuated by clonidine (P less than 0.05). However, the magnitude of the increase in arterial pressure after intubation was not affected. Intraoperative and postoperative hypotension were common after premedication with clonidine 0.3 mg and caution is urged in its use as a premedicant. ",0
"Clinical analyses and short-term prognoses of neonates with subependymal cysts. Twenty-one neonates with subependymal cysts detected by neurosonography soon after birth were prospectively examined. The clinical and cranial sonographic findings were evaluated with respect to short-term prognosis. The prognosis was poor in 6 patients with congenital viral infection (4 with cytomegalovirus infection and 2 with rubella infection). Five patients also had neurodevelopmental abnormalities (2 with neonatal epileptic seizures, 2 with chromosomal abnormalities, and 1 with lissencephaly). The remaining 10 patients had normal psychomotor development. The incidence of congenital viral infection was statistically correlated with a poor neurodevelopmental outcome. A correlation did not exist between the short-term prognosis and each of the other clinical factors or cranial sonographic findings. Our evidence suggests that further investigation of possible subependymal cyst etiologies is required during a careful, long-term follow-up period. ",0
"Magnetic resonance imaging in neurological disorders. To investigate the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in neurological disorders, 115 children were studied in two groups. Group A (78 patients) was studied by paired computed tomography and MRI cranial scans. Group B (37 patients) was studied by paired computed tomography assisted myelography (CTM) and MRI spinal scans. In group A, the scans were generally equivalent for supratentorial tumours and for investigating fits, hydrocephalus, benign intracranial hypertension, and cerebral atrophies, but MRI scanning was superior for posterior fossa tumours and cysts. In group B, MRI scans were superior for intramedullary spinal tumours, spinal dysraphic problems with tethering or syrinx, and were complementary to CTM in diastematomyelia. ",0
"Evaluation of current extrication orthoses in immobilization of the unstable cervical spine. An experiment was designed to evaluate the comparative stabilizing efficacy of several widely used semi-rigid orthoses applied to unstable fresh cadaver cervical spines subject to load. Cadaver specimens were surgically destabilized at the C4-5 segment. Lateral radiographs of the destabilized spine were obtained before and after collar placement and after the application of a 5-pound flexion force. Data analysis employing a one-way analysis of variance showed no statistically significant difference in the Necloc's, Philadelphia Collar's, or the Stifneck's ability to stabilize the cervical spine against a deforming flexion force (P greater than 0.05). They all provide translational stability while allowing angular changes to occur with application of the flexion force. The Philadelphia Collar Halo System is statistically superior to all three of the aforementioned collars in prevention of both translation and sagittal rotation (P less than 0.05). ",0
"Femorofemoral bypass: a profile of graft failure. We have reviewed our experience with 71 patients who had a femorofemoral bypass for unilateral iliac artery occlusion or stenosis. We analyzed morbidity, mortality, initial relief of symptoms, early patency, and long-term primary and secondary patency; and we attempted to identify the cause of graft failure. The overall hospital mortality after operative repair was 4%. One-year survival was 84% and 2-year survival was 81%. Early patency was 98.5% at 1 month, late patency was 91% at 1 year and 82% at 5 years. The major cause of graft failure was inadequate run-off and outflow disease progression. ",0
"Pulmonary embolism presenting as exercise-induced hypotension. A 68-year-old man with remote history of previous myocardial infarction presented with a four-week history of intermittent dyspnea. After developing hypotension during an exercise tolerance test, he underwent cardiac catheterization, revealing significant pulmonary hypertension and two-vessel coronary artery disease. Pulmonary angiography confirmed the presence of pulmonary emboli which partially resolved after thrombolytic therapy. Subsequent treadmill testing confirmed the absence of exercise-induced hypotension two months following treatment. This case underscores the importance of considering pulmonary embolism as a potential cause of exercise-induced hypotension, since it can be successfully treated with thrombolytic agents weeks after the initial onset of symptoms. ",0
"Problems of resistant dermatophytes. Recalcitrant fungal infections are defined as infections that are difficult or impossible to eradicate despite seemingly adequate treatment with appropriate oral or parenteral antibiotics. Relative or absolute microbial resistance is only one of the many causes of recalcitrance. Others include failure of the patient to comply with the prescribed treatment regimen, drug degradation in the liver, drug-drug interactions, reabsorption or washout of the drug from the stratum corneum, and failure of the drug to reach the stratum corneum. Excretion in the eccrine sweat is the principal pathway by which griseofulvin and ketoconazole, the two currently available oral antifungal agents, are delivered to the stratum corneum. Measures that promote delivery of these drugs to this site by enhancing sweating and minimizing drug run-off and absorption onto clothing may aid in optimizing the therapeutic response to these agents.

"Computed tomography for evaluation of puerperal infections. Pelvic computed tomography was used to evaluate 74 women with persistent puerperal infection. There was at least one abnormal roentgenographic finding in 57, and these are correlated with clinical and surgical findings. In 16 women, a palpable pelvic mass was seen on tomography, however, masses not appreciated clinically were visualized in another 29 women, and in five, a clinically palpable mass was not visualized by tomography. In 12 women who had a normal pelvic examination, septic pelvic thrombophlebitis was diagnosed by tomography. Over-all, there was poor correlation with roentgenographic findings and uterine incisional necrosis and dehiscence. We conclude that pelvic tomography is useful to evaluate some women with persistent puerperal infection, but that these studies must be correlated with clinical findings. ",0
"Imaging modalities in recurrent head and neck tumors. Patients with recurrent neoplasms of the head and neck present perplexing management problems, and accurate preoperative assessment of their disease is crucial. Thirty-eight patients with suspected recurrent neoplasms comprise this study: 30 had computed tomography scans, 4 had magnetic resonance images, and 4 patients underwent both computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging to assess the anatomical extent of pathology in 34 malignant and 4 benign tumors. Contrast enhancement was essential for detecting disease on computed tomography scan. Differentiation of recurrent tumor was more difficult when the patient had undergone radiation. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated superior visibility in recurrent parotid and paranasal sinus neoplasm, but was less helpful in laryngeal and pharyngeal recurrences. Computed tomography demonstration of a mass with infiltration of normal fat or tissue planes or lymphadenopathy correlated highly with recurrent disease. Imaging techniques and fine points for determining recurrent neoplasms are presented. ",0
"Fucosylated oligosaccharides of human milk protect suckling mice from heat-stabile enterotoxin of Escherichia coli. Human milk protects suckling mice from the diarrheagenic effects of heat-stabile enterotoxin of Escherichia coli (ST). To identify the human milk fraction responsible for this protection, pooled skimmed, deproteinated milk was passed through charcoal, whereupon lactose was separated from the oligosaccharides. The oligosaccharides contained ST-protective activity; the lactose did not. The neutral, but not the acidic, fraction exhibited protective activity against ST (22% vs. 57% mortality, respectively; P less than .001). The fucosylated, but not the nonfucosylated, subfractions of the neutral fraction contained the factor protective against ST (35% vs. 50% mortality, respectively; P less than .05). An oligosaccharide isolation scheme based on different principles produced confirmatory results. The commercially available neutral fucosylated oligosaccharides of human milk did not significantly protect the mice from the effects of ST. Thus, the protective factor against ST seems to be a minor neutral fucosyloligosaccharide of human milk. ",0
"Intrathoracic fibrin glue for postoperative pleuropulmonary fistula. Twenty cases of persistent pleuropulmonary fistula after a thoracic surgical procedure were successfully treated with fibrin glue injection into the thoracic cavity through a drainage tube. A new technique, the overlying method, which is a modification of the conventional technique of fibrin glue injection, was devised. Each patient received one to four injections (mean number, 1.6). This method resulted in closure of the pleuropulmonary fistula in all but 1 patient. Minor complications included pain in 1 patient and fever in 3 patients. A control study involving 24 patients with pleuropulmonary fistula was performed. Autoblood, OK-432, and tetracycline were used instead of fibrin glue. The fistula resolved in 12 patients. Complications after injection included pain in 15 patients, fever in 10, and occlusion of the chest tube in 4. With our new method, patients rarely exhibited pain and fever, and occlusion of the chest tube did not occur. ",0
"The long-distance effects of brain lesions: visualization of myelinated pathways in the human brain using polarizing and fluorescence microscopy. We describe several new possibilities for the study of degenerated myelinated tracts in the human central nervous system (CNS). The methods are based on the visualization of myelin breakdown products that show birefringence in polarized light and, when stained with Nile blue and benzpyrene-3,4, exhibit fluorescence. Even after lengthy formalin fixation, the methods permit the localization of anterogradely degenerated tracts in a variety of fiber systems in the brains of patients who died between five and 20 months after the onset of neurological symptoms. Particularly the polarizing technique, because of its simplicity, can be added to the usual neuropathological methods for demonstrating the long-distance effects of a brain lesion. As research tools, these methods would also aid in the study of the anatomical substrate of human neurological symptomatology. ",0
"Mitral valve disruption following percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty. Two cases of massive mitral regurgitation due to mitral valve disruption following percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty are reported. This severe complication occurred in two elderly women with recurrent mitral stenosis after previous surgical commissurotomy. Due to their unstable hemodynamic and clinical condition, both patients underwent emergency valve replacement. At surgery, the commissures appeared fused and heavily calcified; the chordae tendineae thickened, shortened, and fused; and the leaflets presented a large tear with sheared edges. Because the technical aspects of both procedures were unremarkable, the anatomic features of the mitral valve seemed to affect the occurrence of severe mitral regurgitation. Percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty should be therefore applied carefully to patients with prior surgical valvotomy, in whom the structural alterations of the mitral apparatus may predispose to severe valvular damage.

"Traditional versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a minimally invasive procedure whereby the gallbladder is removed using laparoscopic techniques. The indications are similar to those for elective traditional cholecystectomy, but selection of patients is important for success. Contraindications are currently evolving. Patients with advanced cholecystitis, abdominal sepsis, ileus, bleeding disorders, pregnancy, and morbid obesity should not undergo this procedure. The procedure requires good traditional surgical skills, as well as additional laparoscopic (and laser) skills. Operative time is slightly longer than for traditional cholecystectomy, but decreases with experience. Morbidity is low, but there is a concern about bile duct injuries. Mortality is very low (0%) and is comparable to traditional cholecystectomy (0.4%). The major advantages of laparoscopic cholecystectomy are the short hospital stay (average: 2 days) and early return to normal activity (7 days). This results in a reduction in hospital costs. Adequate training and credentialing are important processes to foster good patient outcomes. ",0
"Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and cough. Prevalence in an outpatient medical clinic population. To determine the frequency of ACE inhibitor cough in an outpatient medical clinic population, a cross-sectional epidemiologic survey using mailed questionnaires was done. Patients were randomly selected from a computerized hospital pharmacy data base. The overall prevalence of cough was 19 percent in the ACE inhibitor groups compared with 9 percent in the hydrochlorothiazide-treated group. The observed odds ratio for cough among ACE inhibitor users was 2.3 (95 percent CI, 1.02 to 5.00). This study is the first systematic investigation of frequency and characteristics of ACE inhibitor cough that includes a control group. Our results suggest that cough may more frequently accompany treatment with ACE inhibitors than has been previously reported. We recommend that physicians specifically inquire about cough in patients taking an ACE inhibitor. Recognition of this side effect may prevent unnecessary testing and treatment of patients receiving ACE inhibitors. ",0
"Management of perineal wounds following abdominoperineal resection with inferior gluteal flaps. Our experience treating perineal wounds secondary to abdominoperineal resection, either for inflammatory bowel disease or cancer, is presented. A total of 16 patients were treated either on a delayed basis or at the same time as the abdominoperineal resection. All wounds were closed using the inferior gluteal myocutaneous flap. Fifteen of 16 patients have achieved healing, eight of whom had no complications. Only minor revisions or local wound care were required in the remaining patients, with only one patient failing to heal. Our results compare favorably with previous reports of treatment of this difficult problem. ",0
"Cytologic features of poorly differentiated 'insular' carcinoma of the thyroid, as revealed by fine-needle aspiration biopsy. The authors report on the cytologic features of six cases of poorly differentiated ""insular"" carcinoma (IC) of the thyroid, a recently described variety of thyroid tumor intermediate between well-differentiated and anaplastic neoplasms. It is characterized by trabecular and/or alveolar growth patterns, merging with follicular areas, and by the absence of pleomorphism in the tumor cells. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) materials (both smears and cell-block preparations) from six patients were reviewed after the diagnosis of IC was confirmed on the surgical specimen. The following cytologic features were consistently found: high cellularity and necrotic background; low grade of atypia; trabeculae and/or clusters, possibly associated with microfollicles, of cells with poorly defined cytoplasm; and cytoplasmic vacuoles containing thyroglobulin. Nuclear inclusions and grooving of the nuclear surface were additional features. Preoperative diagnosis suggestive of IC might be of value for planning surgical treatment and subsequent therapy. ",0
"Magnetic resonance imaging of facial nerve neuromas. Facial nerve neuromas are uncommon tumors often confused with other tumors of the temporal bone and cerebellopontine angle. Radiologically, it may be impossible to differentiate an intracanalicular facial nerve neuroma from an acoustic neuroma. We present three case reports of facial nerve neuromas arising within the internal auditory canal to show the important magnetic resonance imaging features of these tumors. One tumor extended into the cerebellopontine angle, middle cranial fossa, and middle ear. Another filled the internal auditory canal and extended through the cerebellopontine angle to the brain stem. The third occurred in a patient who had neurofibromatosis as well as numerous other intracranial tumors. We feel that gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging provides the most useful information in the preoperative assessment of this disorder. ",0
"Treatment of advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the skin with cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and bleomycin. The authors treated 14 patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin or lip with one to four cycles of combination chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin by bolus injection, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and bleomycin by continuous 5-day infusion. Objective responses were seen in 11 of the 13 evaluable patients (84%). Four patients had a complete remission (30%) and seven patients, a partial remission (54%). Local control after definitive complementary radiation and/or surgical treatment was achieved in seven patients. Toxic side effects was acceptable; they consisted of nausea and vomiting in all patients, transient skin changes, hematologic (Grade 3/4) abnormalities in four patients, and pulmonary fibrosis in one elderly patient. These results show that this chemotherapy combination could play a role in reducing the tumor mass and in facilitating definitive treatment to obtain better functional and cosmetic results in advanced SCC of the skin.

"Localization of the human angiogenin gene to chromosome band 14q11, proximal to the T cell receptor alpha/delta locus. The gene encoding angiogenin, a potent inducer of blood vessel formation, has been localized within the human genome. It is present as a single copy per haploid genome and is located on chromosome 14, on the basis of discordancy analysis of human-rodent hybrid cell lines. This localization was refined to 14q11 by in situ hybridization of an angiogenin probe to metaphase chromosomes prepared from both normal human lymphocytes and RPMI 8402 cells. The results from the RPMI 8402 cells also establish that the angiogenin gene resides proximal to a translocation breakpoint within the T cell receptor alpha/delta locus and therefore upstream from that locus. An AvaII RFLP, present at a frequency of 29% in an unselected collection of human placental DNAs, was identified in the coding region of the gene and results from a single silent transversion. ",0
"Use of H2-receptor antagonists in children. H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) have evolved into the mainstay of anti-acid therapy for pediatric patients, replacing antacids and other modes of therapy. Much of the experience and data used for therapeutic decisions in children, however, have been extrapolated from adult studies. Ranitidine and cimetidine have been studied most extensively in the adult and pediatric populations. Both raise gastric pH and achieve other therapeutic endpoints; however, cimetidine appears to have a greater frequency of both adversed effects and drug interactions. H2RAs are the preferred agents for prevention of stress ulcers, ulcer disease, and reflux esophagitis in the pediatric population. ",0
"Serous papillary adenocarcinoma of the tunica vaginalis of the testis with metastasis. Testicular or paratesticular neoplasms that resemble the common epithelial type of ovarian tumor are quite rare. The authors report the case of a 29-year-old man with a metastatic serous papillary adenocarcinoma arising from the tunica vaginalis. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of a serous carcinoma of the tunica vaginalis behaving in a malignant fashion. The fact that clinically apparent metastatic disease occurred 4 years after initial presentation suggests that development of metastases is a late event. Unfortunately, the tumor has been refractory to therapy with chemotherapeutic agents with activity against ovarian malignancies. ",0
"Historical review of pancreaticoduodenectomy. The performance of pancreaticoduodenectomy by Whipple in 1935 demonstrated that the operation was feasible technically and compatible with reasonable function after recovery. From the mid- to late 1940s until the last 10 years, the procedure was condemned by many because of its associated mortality and morbidity. For reasons that are not clear, the risk of pancreaticoduodenectomy in the last 10 years has fallen to less than 10% and in several centers, less than 5%. Postoperative complications have been reduced and blood transfusions are unnecessary in an increasing number of patients. Furthermore, a normal productive life without the need for medication and with no digestive disorder is expected. Seventy-one percent of patients are able to return to their preoperative occupation.

"Electroencephalography should not be routine in the evaluation of syncope in adults We reviewed the reports of all electroencephalograms obtained at the Nashville (Tenn) Veterans Administration Hospital from September 1987 to August 1989. Seventy-three patients were referred for evaluation of syncope or near syncope. Of these 73 patients, 10 (13.7%) had abnormal findings. Twenty-six patients were referred for other complaints similar to syncope (ie, blackouts, loss of consciousness, falling out, passing out, and fainting). Of these 26 patients, five (19.2%) had abnormal findings. We reviewed the medical records of the patients with abnormal findings and found that the final diagnosis or treatment of the syncope was affected by electroencephalogram in only one patient. These findings suggest that routine electroencephalography is not of significant value in the evaluation of syncope in adults. ",0
"Clustered tRNA genes in Schizosaccharomyces pombe centromeric DNA sequence repeats. The centromere-associated B' and B DNA sequence repeats of Schizosaccharomyces pombe chromosomes I and II have been found to contain clusters of tRNA genes. The centromere II region (cen2) includes at least 22 tRNA genes distributed among five copies of the B sequence repeat containing genes specifying tRNA(Ile), tRNA(Ala), and tRNA(Val). Individual B repeats are variously associated with other tRNA genes, including those specifying tRNA(Lys), tRNA(Arg), and tRNA(Glu2). The centromere I region (cen1) contains at least six tRNA genes in two copies of the B' repeated element, including genes specifying tRNA(Ile), tRNA(Ala), and tRNA(Glu3). Multiple tandemly arranged clusters of tRNA genes are presumably conserved due to restricted recombination frequencies in the centromere regions. ",0
"Brucella endocarditis: the role of combined medical and surgical treatment. Brucella endocarditis, although a rare complication of brucellosis, is the main cause of death related to this disease. This report describes a case of aortic endocarditis due to Brucella abortus in an elderly farmer with known aortic stenosis. Urgent valve replacement was performed because of progressive heart failure despite appropriate antimicrobial treatment. The infection was cured with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and rifampin given for 3 months after surgery. A review of the literature reports on the 38 other cases of cured brucella endocarditis made clear the need for combined antimicrobial treatment and surgical valve replacement. ",0
"Treatment of fulminant hepatic failure with insulin and glucagon. A randomized, controlled trial. Insulin and glucagon are among the therapeutic modalities that have been investigated in the treatment of fulminant hepatic failure (FHF). We have completed a randomized, controlled trial of insulin and glucagon in 38 patients with FHF from either viral or toxin exposure. The control and treatment groups consisted of 21 and 17 patients, respectively, and did not differ significantly in etiology or admission laboratory values. Mortality was not significantly different between control and treatment groups and was 67% and 82%, respectively. Time from randomization to death or discharge was not significantly different between the two groups. Peak levels of alpha-fetoprotein were statistically higher in survivors than in nonsurvivors (P less than 0.01). We conclude that even though a type-2 error may exist, the combination of insulin and glucagon is not useful in the treatment of FHF. ",0
"Crohn's disease in the city of Derby, 1951-85. An epidemiological survey of Crohn's disease in the city of Derby showed that the incidence of the condition increased from 0.7/10(5) per year between 1951 and 1955 to 6.67/10(5) per year between 1981 and 1985 but seemed to reach a plateau between 1976 and 1985. Large bowel Crohn's disease was more common in patients presenting aged 60-79 years than in those aged 20-39 years. The increase in incidence was not solely due to the detection of milder disease. There was no evidence that the Asian (Indian subcontinent) population of Derby was resistant to the development of Crohn's disease. ",0
"Patients' expectations of patient-controlled analgesia. Patient-controlled analgesia is an increasingly popular method of postoperative pain relief. However, patients often worry about new therapies. Eighty ASA 1 and 2 patients aged 18-65 years were asked to list the advantages and disadvantages of using patient-controlled analgesia. The most important advantage as perceived by patients was the reduced time spent by nurses in giving medication, but there was concern that direct personal contact would also be lessened. Preservation of self control, autonomy, rapid onset of analgesia, ability to titrate analgesia and lack of injections were seen as an advantage. Addiction and machine faults were seen as minimal problems. Preservation of patient-nurse contact is of great importance to ensure success of postoperative analgesia. ",0
"Laser angioplasty: results of a prospective, multicenter study at 3-year follow-up. A prospective multicenter trial was initiated to evaluate the efficacy and safety of laser angioplasty. Laser recanalization was performed in 338 patients with arteriosclerotic femoropopliteal artery occlusions (average length, 8.5 cm). Neodymium-yttrium-aluminum-garnet lasers were used in combination with sapphire probe catheters. The initial recanalization rate was 85%. Complications were observed in 14% of the patients. Emergency surgery was required in 1.5%. The cumulative long-term patency rate of the successfully recanalized arteries was 80%, 70%, 62%, and 57% at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 and 3 years, respectively. The patency rates were not affected by the length of the occlusion and the long-term medication (platelet inhibition vs anticoagulation), but patients with a normal runoff had significantly better patency rates than those with reduced runoff (63% vs 52%, P less than .01). The study has shown that laser-assisted angioplasty is safe and at least as effective as conventional angioplasty. ",0
"Optimum results of the surgical treatment of carotid territory ischemia. Continuing controversy over the role of carotid endarterectomy in stroke prevention is based largely on reports in which high perioperative morbidity and mortality rates obviate possible long-term benefit from the procedure. The purpose of this review is to examine optimal results of carotid surgery in order to describe the potential for the procedure in stroke prevention. Optimal surgical results are compared with optimal medical results in the therapy of symptomatic patients and with optimal nonsurgical results in the therapy of asymptomatic patients. Factors common to series with excellent results, such as patient selection and operative technique, are examined, and problems such as recurrent carotid stenosis and coexisting coronary disease, which continue to plague even the best surgical series, are discussed.

"Mechanical measures in the prophylaxis of postoperative thromboembolism in total knee arthroplasty. Total knee arthroplasty patients are at high risk for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Prophylaxis against deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in these patients seems mandatory. Pharmacologic agents such as dextran 40, aspirin, and warfarin are effective but may be associated with significant complications such as drug reaction, bleeding, hematoma, and hemarthrosis. Heparin was not effective and was associated with significant bleeding complications. Mechanical methods such as continuous passive motion and sequential pneumatic compression stockings were without complications and seemed equal to or more effective than pharmacologic agents. Adding warfarin to mechanical methods did not seem to augment the antithromboembolic effect of the mechanical methods. ",0
"Standards for analysis of ventricular late potentials using high-resolution or signal-averaged electrocardiography. A statement by a Task Force Committee of the European Society of Cardiology, the American Heart Association, and the American College of Cardiology. Sufficient data are available to recommend the use of the high-resolution or signal-averaged electrocardiogram in patients recovering from myocardial infarction without bundle branch block to help determine their risk for developing sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias. However, no data are available about the extent to which pharmacological or nonpharmacological interventions in patients with late potentials have an impact on the incidence of sudden cardiac death. Therefore, controlled, prospective studies are required before this issue can be resolved. As refinements in techniques evolve, it is anticipated that the clinical value of high-resolution or signal-averaged electrocardiography will continue to increase. ",0
"Application of INSTAT hemostat in the control of gingival hemorrhage in the patient with thrombocytopenia. A case report. Gingival bleeding in the patient with thrombocytopenia can be a difficult management problem. Primary therapy with platelet transfusions may not be sufficient to control the hemorrhage and adjunctive local therapy may be required. Currently, few local management techniques can effectively control this problem. INSTAT collagen absorbable hemostat can be used as a local adjunct with platelet transfusions and has certain application advantages over topical thrombin and microfibrillar collagen. Two successful techniques of INSTAT application to control gingival hemorrhage in a patient with severe thrombocytopenia in leukemic relapse are described. ",0
"Nonoperative management of bile duct stones. The treatment of choice for most retained bile duct stones is by nonoperative means. If a T-tube is in place, percutaneous techniques via the T-tract are indicated. Percutaneous access via puncture of a Roux-en-Y loop is also practical. In the absence of a T-tube, retrograde endoscopic techniques should be used. Both techniques are very effective and safe. Stones in the intrahepatic and extrahepatic ducts also can be treated nonoperatively. Endoscopic sphincterotomy has a role in the treatment of selected patients with gallstone pancreatitis, acute cholangitis, and choledocholithiasis with in situ gallbladders. In difficult cases, endoscopic and percutaneous techniques are employed in combination. ",0
"Simultaneous hepatoblastoma in identical male twins. Identical male twin infants who in 1987 presented with hepatoblastoma at the age of 7 months are reported. Twin B was admitted for investigation due to enlarged liver and spleen. He was found to have an inoperable hepatoblastoma of fetal type and was treated with chemotherapy and local irradiation. However, 7 months after the chemotherapy the tumor recurred. The asymptomatic twin A was examined because of the known familial cases, and he proved to have an identical tumor. He was successfully radically operated on and 2 years after the chemotherapy is still doing well with no evidence of tumor. As the mother and the maternal grandmother had polyps in the colon, quite probably the hepatoblastomas of the twins were associated with familial adenomatous polyposis. ",0
"Transcranial Doppler in acute hemispheric brain infarction. We studied cerebrovascular anatomy using intra-arterial digital angiography, and blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) using transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography in 42 patients with acute hemispheric ischemic brain infarction. We compared angiography with TCD and the clinical findings within 6 hours of the onset of symptoms. The location and extent of the chronic ischemic brain damage was assessed by CT performed 1 to 3 months after the ictus. Abnormal TCD, as manifested by either an unobtainable MCA flow signal or a significantly depressed MCA flow velocity, was highly associated with proximal MCA occlusions demonstrated by angiography. Abnormal TCD predicted both larger chronic CT lesions and more extensive ischemic change within the MCA territory. These data demonstrate that early TCD conveys useful information concerning cerebral tissue prognosis following hemispheric ischemia. ",0
"Esophageal motility, heartburn, and gastroesophageal reflux: variations in clinical presentation of esophageal dysphagia. Dysphagia is a potentially important symptom, often leading to the finding of an anatomical or motility disorder of the esophagus. Dysphagia and heartburn represent two of the most common symptoms associated with esophageal motility disorders. To explore the relationship of symptomatic esophageal dysphagia and heartburn and their association with primary esophageal motor disorders, we have performed a retrospective assessment of 1035 patient evaluations performed at our gastrointestinal laboratory. A clear statistical association of symptomatic dysphagia and heartburn was established; however, no pattern diagnostic of a specific motility disorder was discernible. A sizable fraction of our patient population with dysphagia demonstrated normal esophageal motility. A significant portion of dyspeptic patients exhibited both normal motility and acid exposure. The differences observed between the incidence of subjective symptoms and objective dysfunction may be explained in part by an altered or increased esophageal sensitivity of these patients. ",0
"Research and policy directions. Salt and blood pressure. The relation between dietary intake of sodium chloride and blood pressure levels remains controversial. The critical questions concern whether there is a susceptible subgroup at risk of elevated blood pressure because of sodium chloride consumption. If there is such a subgroup, what is its size and how can it be identified? Further clinical trials are needed to determine the long-term effects of sodium chloride reduction on blood pressure. The risk of disease, including stroke and coronary heart disease, is linear with blood pressure levels. A small change in blood pressure can have a relatively large impact on disease, even within the normal range of blood pressure. ",0
"The prolonged burner syndrome. Over the course of a single football season, six players evaluated by the medical staff had burners that displayed a prolonged neurologic recovery. These players were examined and subsequently evaluated with isokinetic testing and electrodiagnostic studies to elucidate better the short-term natural history of the prolonged burner syndrome. Evidence of muscular weakness at 72 hours postinjury best correlated with positive electrodiagnostic findings. No correlation was found between the initial physical examination findings and the results of electrodiagnostic testing. Isokinetic strength evaluation demonstrated many relative strength differences that were difficult to discern with manual muscle testing. The return of a player to athletic competition following this injury should largely be based on the clinical examination. ",0
"Significance of magnetic resonance imaging in acute head injury. One hundred seventy-seven patients who had incurred head trauma were studied with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patients varied from those with mild injury without any focal neurological deficit to those with severe injury with post-traumatic coma. Altogether, 177 lesions were demonstrated by MRI in 123 of 177 patients within 3 days of injury using T2-weighted (SE2000/40,2000/111) and T1-weighted (IR1500/500/40) multislice sequences. In contrast, computerized tomography (CT) demonstrated 103 lesions in 90 patients. MRI was superior to CT in the diagnosis of nonhemorrhagic contusions demonstrated as a high-intensity area on T2-weighted imaging. MRI provided some information to evaluate the severity of diffuse axonal injury or to predict delayed traumatic intracerebral hematoma (DTICH). ",0
"Infantile systemic hyalinosis: newly recognized disorder of collagen? Four infants with stiff skin and painful joint contractures in the first few months of life are described. Other features included small papules, particularly on the face and trunk, perianal nodules, hyperpigmentation over the metacarpophalangeal joints and over the malleoli, gingival hyperplasia, persistent diarrhea, and failure to thrive. Two of these infants died before the age of 18 months. In each case hyaline material was found in the papillary dermis. Ultrastructurally, there was a distinctive fibrillogranular appearance in which a banding pattern could be observed. This material was also found within membrane-bound vacuoles in macrophages and fibroblasts. It had an appearance and localization identical with that of collagen type VI. These features are similar to those reported in juvenile hyaline fibromatosis. It is believed that these infants have a closely related, but nonetheless distinctive, inherited disorder of collagen.

"Treatment of metastatic prostate cancer of the spine. There is a wide spectrum of presentations for prostate cancer metastatic to the spine. Important factors are the patient's age and general health; the extent and location of spinal involvement; the patient's neurologic status and degree of pain; the relative contribution of a blastic or lytic response; and the experience and training of the spinal surgeon, medical oncologist, and radiation oncologist. The spine is both a weight-bearing structure and a housing for the spinal cord, and failure to consider both functions may lead to unsatisfactory treatment results. Treatment options include hormonal therapy, inhibitors of bone metabolism, glucocorticoid therapy, radiotherapy, halo-vest, surgical debridement, decompression and stabilization, and appropriate pain management and support. One must not lose sight of the fact that the goals are palliation and that ultimate demise is unavoidable in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. ",0
"11 beta-hydroxyandrostenedione: a marker of adrenal function in hirsutism. To assess the role of the adrenal glands in the development of hirsutism, levels of 11 beta-hydroxyandrostenedione (11 beta-OHA), 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS), androstenedione (delta 4A), and free and total testosterone (T) were measured in 63 hirsute females and 30 control patients. Six of the hirsute patients had basal levels of 11 beta-OHA and 17-OHP and responses to adrenocorticotropic hormone that were significantly greater than these values in controls and the other hirsute women. These women were designated as having an adrenal source for their hirsutism. Women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and idiopathic hirsutism had normal values of 11 beta-OHA and 17-OHP. Levels of total and free T, DHEAS and delta 4A were significantly higher than control values in all of the hirsute women. This study demonstrates that 11 beta-OHA can be used as a marker to assess the adrenal contribution to hirsutism. ",0
"Thalidomide: treatment of severe recurrent aphthous stomatitis in patients with AIDS. An increasing number of AIDS patients have been noted to suffer severe recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS), a condition often associated with high morbidity that remains unresponsive to conventional therapeutic interventions. In two cases thalidomide was administered to successfully treat AIDS patients with RAS. Both patients experienced complete abatement of pain shortly after therapy was initiated. Ulcerations that were present for months resolved after three or four weeks of thalidomide therapy without any adverse effects. Thalidomide appears to be an effective agent for the treatment of severe RAS unresponsive to traditional therapies. ",0
"Double-blind comparison of doxazosin and enalapril in patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension. The antihypertensive efficacy and safety of doxazosin and enalapril were compared in the general practice setting (n = 54). Both agents produced comparable, statistically significant (p less than 0.05) reductions in mean blood pressure with no clinically relevant changes in heart rate. Side effects in the two groups were mild or moderate and disappeared or were tolerated with continued treatment. Doxazosin, in contrast to enalapril, produced a significant (p less than 0.05) reduction in the total serum cholesterol concentration, a reduction in the level of triglycerides, and a favorable increase in the high-density lipoprotein/total cholesterol ratio. The reduction in calculated coronary heart disease risk produced by doxazosin (-27.58%) was highly significant (p less than 0.0002) and greater than that produced by enalapril (-18.49% p less than 0.02).

"Acute naming deficits following dominant temporal lobectomy: prediction by age at 1st risk for seizures. Age at 1st risk for seizures may predict anomia following dominant anterior temporal lobectomy. We assessed confrontation naming before and 2 to 3 weeks after surgery in 45 right-handed patients grouped by side of focus and presence or absence of early (less than or equal to 5 years) risk factors. After left lobectomy, 6 of 10 (60%) patients with no early risks demonstrated significant decline (greater than or equal to 25%) in naming, but none of the patients with early risks showed this decline. After right lobectomy, there was no change. Cerebral representation of naming may be atypical in patients with early risks. ",0
"Maintenance and relapse after weight loss in women: behavioral aspects. Obese women who regained weight after successful weight reduction (relapsers, n = 44); formerly obese, average-weight women who maintained weight loss (maintainers, n = 30); and women who had always remained at the same average, nonobese weight (control subjects, n = 34) were interviewed. Most maintainers (90%) and control subjects (82%) exercised regularly, were conscious of their behaviors, used available social support (70% and 80%, respectively), confronted problems directly (95% and 60%, respectively), and used personally developed strategies to help themselves. Few relapsers exercised (34%), most ate unconsciously in response to emotions (70%), few used available social support (38%), and few confronted problems directly (10%). These findings suggest the advisability of development and prospective evaluation of individualized treatment programs designed to enhance exercise, coping skills, and social support. ",0
"An open trial of high-dosage antioxidants in early Parkinson's disease. High dosages of tocopherol and ascorbate were administered to patients with early Parkinson's disease as a preliminary open-labeled trial for the eventual controlled double-blind study evaluating antioxidants as a test of the endogenous toxin hypothesis of the etiology of Parkinson's disease. The primary endpoint of the trial was the need to treat patients with levodopa. The time when levodopa became necessary in the treated patients was compared with another group of patients followed elsewhere and not taking antioxidants. The time when levodopa became necessary was extended by 2.5 y in the group taking antioxidants. The results of this pilot study suggest that the progression of Parkinson's disease may be slowed by the administration of these antioxidants. A large multicenter, controlled clinical trial currently underway in North America evaluating tocopherol and deprenyl has the potential to confirm these results. ",0
"Psychologic and behavioral aspects of chronic headache. It is important for physicians to be aware of the expectations and psychologic needs patients have, to understand how psychologic and personality variables can impact care, to realize the importance of patient education, and to be cognizant of how environmental factors can influence headache pain behaviors. Empirical data indicate that the nonpharmacologic treatments of biofeedback, relaxation, and stress coping training can serve as useful adjunctive or alternative procedures, and that the combined use of medication and nonpharmacologic treatments yields the greatest clinical outcome. Certain headache types show minimal response to nondrug therapies alone (cluster, menstrual, and post-traumatic headache). Age and personality variables have a bearing on nondrug treatment outcome as well. ",0
"Ruptured mature cystic teratoma of the ovary with recurrence in the liver and colon 17 years later. A case report. A mature cystic teratoma of the ovary occurred in a 51-year-old woman and recurred as a large intrahepatic tumor mass as well as a small mass in the transverse colon 17 years after rupture, intraperitoneal spillage of tumor contents and subtotal surgical removal of the ovarian lesion and peritoneal implants. The patient was treated with a partial hepatectomy and a segmental transverse colectomy. The recurrent lesions, which contained histologically fully mature teratomatous elements only, were excised; the result was a complete cure. To our knowledge this is the first documented report on such a complication of mature cystic teratoma of the ovary. ",0
"Colonic histoplasmosis in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Report of two cases. Colonic histoplasmosis is a rare entity. There have been four previous reported cases within the population of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Because of the increasing incidence of HIV infection within regions where histoplasmosis is endemic, this condition may become more common. Gastrointestinal histoplasmosis has protean clinical manifestations, and symptoms are often nonspecific. Any patient with HIV infection who has unexplained GI symptoms should undergo evaluation for possible histoplasmosis. Aggressive long-term amphotericin B therapy has been effective in HIV patients with histoplasmosis. Resection or diversion of symptomatic colonic strictures caused by histoplasmosis may be necessary in addition to medical therapy. ",0
"Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome: consensus report of an ad hoc committee of the American Association for Hand Surgery on the definition of reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome. This report proposes that reflex sympathetic dystrophy be defined as a pain syndrome in which the pain is accompanied by loss of function and evidence of autonomic dysfunction. In the clinical setting, this diagnosis is usually associated with other anatomic and psychological diagnoses and may be associated with a variety of systemic illnesses and medicolegal factors. All components should be assessed before a treatment plan is established. Priorities should go to emergency care, acute injuries, and systemic illness, psychiatric problems, and chronic anatomic problems, in that order. Early, accurate diagnosis improves prognosis. ",0
"Expression of HLA-DR and secretory component antigens and lymphocyte infiltration in human gastric nonmalignant and malignant tissues: an immunohistochemical study. The relation between HLA-DR and secretory component (SC) expression and the degree of lymphocyte infiltration was immunohistochemically examined in human gastric mucosa with or without intestinal metaplasia and gastric carcinoma tissues. Gastric mucosa without obvious inflammation showed neither expression of HLA-DR or SC nor remarkable lymphoid infiltration. In contrast, gastric mucosa with chronic inflammation, tissues with incomplete type of intestinal metaplasia, and carcinoma demonstrated both HLA-DR and SC in almost the same area and also prominent lymphoid infiltration in the surrounding stroma. This simultaneous expression of HLA-DR and SC was not observed in complete type of intestinal metaplasia. The results indicate a close relationship between expression of HLA-DR and SC and the presence of lymphocyte infiltration in gastric mucosa, areas of incomplete type of intestinal metaplasia and in gastric carcinomas.

"Polypoid melanoma: a virulent variant of nodular melanoma. Report of three cases and literature review. We report the cases of three patients with polypoid melanoma. In no case was there microscopic evidence of melanoma cell invasion below the papillary dermis. In the polypoid variant of nodular melanoma, melanoma cells accumulate in large volume above the skin's surface. This increase in tumor volume encourages dislodgment of melanoma cells that are carried to superficial lymphatic vessels without invading the reticular dermis; this feature differentiates polypoid melanoma from the nonpolypoid nodular variant. Although polypoid melanoma is considered the most malignant form of melanoma, our findings, albeit limited to three cases, suggest that early diagnosis and prompt surgical excision may provide a favorable 5-year survival rate.

"Characterization and histopathological correlation of cytosol proteins of benign and malignant breast tumors. Significant differences in cytosol protein level exist between normal/benign and cancerous breast tissues. There is a positive correlation between the cytosol protein level and histological grade of carcinoma. Well-differentiated carcinoma have a lower value of cytosol protein than poorly differentiated carcinoma. In slab gel electrophoregrams, the total numbers of bands are almost identical in normal, benign, and malignant conditions. In addition, 37 Kd protein band is consistently present in malignant cases and always absent in normal or benign cases. More extensive biophysical examination of this band may provide further insight into the protein alterations in cancer cells at the molecular level. ",0
"A comparison of parallel versus perpendicular placement of retention sutures in abdominal wound closure. A new technique for placement of retention sutures is described. Twenty-five rats underwent midline laparotomy incision. The control group was closed with traditional placement of through-and-through retention sutures placed in a perpendicular direction to the wound. The experimental group was closed with retention sutures placed in a parallel direction to the wound as described below. Wound bursting strength was significantly (P less than 0.001) greater at one to five days in the experimental group compared with the control animals. In addition, inflammatory reaction and pressure necrosis were greater in the control group. It appears that parallel placement of sutures has less of a tendency to cut through tissue when subjected to the distracting forces on a midline wound. ",0
"Fibrillation potential amplitude and muscle atrophy following peripheral nerve injury. Maximum peak-to-peak fibrillation potential amplitude was measured in 69 subjects between 7 days and 10 1/2 years post complete or partial peripheral nerve injury. Mean amplitude during the first 2 months was 612 muV; third and fourth months 512 muV, fifth and sixth months 320 muV. After the first year, no population of fibrillation potentials greater than 100 muV was recorded. The sciatic nerve was sectioned in 13 guinea pigs and animals studied up to 17 weeks. Fibrillation potential amplitude in gastrocnemius muscles declined paralleling that in humans. By the end of the study, type I fibers had lost almost half of their initial diameter and type II fibers had atrophied more than twice this amount. Fibrillation potential amplitude may be useful in estimating the time post nerve injury and appears to correlate with the surface area and fiber diameter of a type I muscle fiber. ",0
"Prevention of hypotension following spinal anaesthesia for elective caesarean section by wrapping of the legs. Twenty-four parturients undergoing elective Caesarean section were allocated randomly to have the legs wrapped with elasticated Esmarch bandages immediately following spinal anaesthesia or to serve as controls. Significant hypotension (systolic arterial pressure less than 100 mm Hg and less than 80% of baseline value) was treated with i.v. ephedrine in 5-mg boluses. Leg wrapped patients had a significantly (P = 0.0033) lower incidence (16.7%) of hypotension than controls (83.3%). Only two patients in the leg wrapped group required ephedrine compared with 10 in the control group. Systolic arterial pressure was significantly (P less than 0.05) less in control subjects at 4, 5 and 6 min following spinal injection. No patient in the leg wrapped group became hypotensive following removal of the elasticated bandages. ",0
"The natural history of non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy. Seventy one patients with non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy were studied retrospectively. Sixty three (89%) were followed to the end of the study or death, mean follow up time was 5.3 years. Whilst twenty (28%) had diabetes or hypertension, in thirty nine (55%) no predisposing condition was identified. In those who had monocular disease at presentation (68), subsequent involvement of the second eye occurred in seventeen (25%), seven within the first year. Nineteen patients died within the study period. Of these, nine died from myocardial infarction and four from cerebrovascular disease. This is a significant increase above figures calculated from the Office of Population Census and Surveys (p less than 0.001 for all causes, p less than 0.002 for myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular disease). Such an increase in mortality has not been previously reported, and implies that this condition carries a more sinister systemic prognosis than is frequently supposed. ",0
"An immunofluorescence study of cerebral malaria. A correlation with histopathology. Histopathologic and immunopathologic features of cerebral malaria have been defined in a study of six autopsy cases with severe Plasmodium falciparum infection. In five cases, immunofluorescent studies demonstrated intense deposition of P falciparum antigen, IgG, and fibrin in cerebral vessels associated with the histopathologic finding of hemorrhage in the white matter of cerebrum and cerebellum regardless of the presence of parasitized erythrocytes in the cerebral vessels. Immunofluorescent study also demonstrated the extravascular deposits of P falciparum granular antigen associated with acute inflammatory lesion in cerebral tissue in one case. These findings suggested that the immunopathogenic mechanism may in some way play a role in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria. ",0
"Diagnostic significance of carcinoembryonic antigen in the differential diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma. The histologic and cytologic distinction of malignant mesothelioma from carcinomas metastatic to the pleura or peritoneum is often problematic. For this reason immunologic methods are being increasingly used as diagnostic adjuncts. This review summarizes 40 studies on the expression of carcinoembryonic antigen in mesotheliomas and in lung and other carcinomas involving the pleura or peritoneum. Carcinoembryonic antigen was identified immunohistochemically in 11% of mesotheliomas and in 84% of carcinomas examined and immunocytochemically (in serous effusions) in 4% and 58%, respectively. In serum and in pleural or ascitic fluid, significantly elevated levels of carcinoembryonic antigen are commonly associated with (lung) carcinomas but rarely with mesotheliomas. Thus, together with identification of the antigen in serum, pleural fluid, or ascitic fluid, immunohistochemical and immunocytochemical techniques for detecting carcinoembryonic antigen provide a valuable aid for distinguishing malignant mesothelioma from metastatic carcinomas.

Epidermoid cyst (monodermal teratoma) of the testis. We report 14 patients with epidermoid cyst of the testis (monodermal teratoma). In 7 patients (5 treated within the last 5 years) the mass was excised and adjacent testicular tissue was biopsied. Seven patients underwent radical inguinal orchiectomy. Carcinoma in situ was not detected in any testicular tissue examined. There was no evidence of tumour recurrence in any patient after a mean follow-up of 10 years. Ultrasonographic appearance was not specific for a diagnosis of epidermoid cyst and exploratory surgery was required in all cases. Excision of the tumour and biopsy of adjacent testicular tissue to determine the presence or absence of carcinoma in situ is adequate treatment for this rare testicular neoplasm. ,0
"Differentiation in embryonal neuroepithelial tumors of the central nervous system. Ninety-six embryonal neuroectodermal tumors were studied histologically and immunohistologically with a panel of antibodies including glial, neuronal, epithelial, mesodermal, and myelin markers. In 71 tumors there was glial and neuronal differentiation and expression both of an S (photoreceptor) antigen and vimentin. In five tumors there was only glial differentiation and in 20 tumors only neuronal differentiation. No reactivity for myelin and epithelial markers was found. Histologic and immunohistologic findings identified various degrees of differentiation in different tumors, which was bipolar (glial and neuronal) in most tumors and unipolar in the remainder. The authors suggest that their findings may be the result of normal or aberrant oncogenic differentiation, agreeing with the nomenclature of the World Health Organization classification for these tumors with and the inclusion of a category for ependymoblastoma.

"Immunohistochemical demonstration of the placental form of glutathione S-transferase, a detoxifying enzyme in human gliomas. Expression of the human placental form of glutathion S-transferase (GST-pi) in human gliomas was investigated by immunohistochemical methods, and the result was compared with that of normal human glial cells. The gliomas in this study were composed of five benign astrocytomas (Grade 2), ten anaplastic astrocytomas (Grade 3), and 16 glioblastomas (Grade 4). Normal human glial cells showed only a weak immunostaining response for GST-pi in the cytoplasm or some nuclear membranes. All of benign astrocytomas had diffusely weak GST-pi immunostaining, resembling that of normal glial cells. With increasing grade, gliomas showed a strongly positive reaction for GST-pi. The positive reactions were remarkable especially in the gemistocytes and giant cells in the high-grade gliomas. These results suggest that cells of gliomas have some detoxifying function and the expression of this detoxifying enzyme, GST-pi, is related to the degree of malignancy of the gliomas. ",0
"Orthostatic hypotension after spinal cord injury: treatment with fludrocortisone and ergotamine. We report a case of a 28-year-old woman with C5 quadriplegia, unresponsive to conservative treatment for orthostatic hypotension. Ergotamine, daily combined with fludrocortisone, successfully prevented symptomatic hypotension. In this report, neural, renal, and hormonal blood pressure regulatory mechanisms are described. Experiences obtained from this case and the existing literature suggest that (1) in persons with quadriplegia, plasma catecholamine levels show little increase with sitting, indicating an inability to activate baroreceptor and chemoreceptor reflexes, (2) elevated plasma aldosterone and renin levels indicate a renal compensatory response to decreased renal perfusion secondary to low plasma volume and/or chronic hypotension, and (3) the net effect of ergotamine and fludrocortisone is probably a combination of plasma volume expansion and direct peripheral vasoconstriction.

"Morphological and histopathological aspects of aneurysms after patch aortoplasty for coarctation. Repair of coarctation of the aorta by synthetic patch grafting has been complicated by late aneurysm formation. These aneurysms differ macroscopically from atherosclerotic thoracic aortic dilatations. Specimens for microscopic examination were taken from 14 of 20 patients undergoing aneurysm resection. Histological analysis of the specimens showed medionecrosis in 13 patients of the specimens showed medionecrosis in 13 patients (93%), foreign body reaction in 11 patients (78%), and intimal thickening in 3 patients (21%). The three layers of the aortic wall could be identified in the aneurysms. On the basis of these results, we discuss the etiologic factors and pathogenetic mechanisms involved in the development of these aneurysms. ",0
"Quantitative assessment of extradural bupivacaine analgesia. Bupivacaine (0.5%) 20 ml was administered extradurally to six healthy volunteers. It was found that simultaneous application of 10 needles to the skin could evoke pain when analgesia was obtained to one needle stimulation. In addition, a laser beam was used as a quantitative technique to activate simultaneously many cutaneous nociceptors. For 7 h, thresholds (sensory and pain) and pain-evoked brain potentials (amplitude and latency) to laser stimulation were monitored and used for quantitative assessment of onset, efficacy and duration of analgesia at various dermatomes (C7, T8, T10, T12, L1, L3, S1). The onset time of analgesia was shortest and conduction delay longest at the dermatome related to the site of injection (L3). Full analgesia was obtained at L1, L3 and S1, although the peak efficacy at S1 was delayed for 120-180 min after injection. A minor effect was found at dermatome C7 approximately 60 min after injection. ",0
"Visual losses after myopic epikeratoplasty. The vision of seven patients who had undergone epikeratoplasty for myopia was evaluated by measuring their contrast sensitivity functions without and with the presence of a glare source. Compared with findings for a normal control population, these epikeratoplasty patients were found to have statistically significant contrast sensitivity losses. To evaluate the clinical relevance of these losses, the results were also compared with those for two other patient groups with abnormal corneal optics, seven radial keratotomy patients and seven keratoconus patients wearing rigid contact lenses. Contrast thresholds for the epikeratoplasty and keratoconus patients were similar and usually statistically indistinguishable, and their losses were far more profound than those of the radial keratotomy patients. The addition of glare did not alter this pattern of losses. The results document the extent of vision losses in these patients and suggest that increased intraocular light scattering is not a major contributor to the observed contrast sensitivity decrements.

"Sudden death due to delayed rupture of hepatic subcapsular hematoma following blunt abdominal trauma. Blunt abdominal trauma can cause sudden, unexpected death due to injuries to internal organs. Rupture of a hepatic subcapsular hematoma is a relatively rare cause of sudden death following minor blunt abdominal trauma. Death may be delayed several days to weeks. The autopsy is an invaluable diagnostic tool that can be utilized to uncover sudden deaths due to abdominal trauma. The case of an alcoholic who died of a ruptured hepatic subcapsular hematoma is presented. The death investigation revealed that the victim had sustained blunt abdominal trauma during a fall a few days prior to death. ",0
"Identification and characterization of a regulated promoter element in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene. We have identified a 36-base-pair proximal element (-112 to -77 relative to the AUG translation initiation codon) in the epidermal growth factor receptor 5' region that functions as a promoter; mediates inductive responses to epidermal growth factor, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and cyclic AMP; and acts in an orientation-independent manner. This region functions as an enhancer when transferred to a heterologous promoter containing a TATA box. Mutations within the 36-base-pair region alter function as assayed by reporter gene expression in recipient cells. A protein has been identified that demonstrates appropriate binding specificity to mutant DNA sequences that correlates with promoter activity observed in vivo. On the basis of DNA binding characteristics and size, the identified protein appears distinct from several previously identified transcription factors known to bind to G+C-rich regions. ",0
"Partial characterization of Chlamydia trachomatis isolates resistant to multiple antibiotics. In vitro susceptibility testing was done on urogenital isolates of Chlamydia trachomatis from five patients, four of whom were suspected treatment failures. At least one isolate from each patient was resistant to tetracycline at concentrations greater than or equal to micrograms/ml, although less than 1% of a population of organisms showed high-level resistance. Fully resistant populations selected by passage through 8 micrograms/ml tetracycline either died or lost their resistance on further passage in antibiotic-free medium. Relatively large inocula were required to demonstrate resistance, and morphology of inclusions was altered at high tetracycline concentrations. The observed resistance may be a new characteristic of the organism or merely newly recognized. Isolates resistant to tetracycline were resistant to doxycycline, erythromycin, sulfamethoxazole, and clindamycin but sensitive to rifampin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin. Thus, resistance to tetracycline, erythromycin, and clindamycin occurs in C. trachomatis and may be a factor in some treatment failures. ",0
"Posthospital course and outcome in schizophrenia. To study the early course of schizophrenia, we assessed 79 early phase, young, DSM-III schizophrenic patients at two successive posthospital follow-ups, 2.5 and 5.0 years after index hospitalization. More than 50% of the sample had poor overall outcome, with either severe impairment in functioning and symptoms, or suicide, in the follow-up period. Rehospitalization rates decreased significantly during the course of the two posthospital assessments, despite the sample showing persisting psychosis. Only a small group of schizophrenic patients showed complete remission: 10% at the first follow-up and 17% at the second follow-up, when patients who suicided are excluded from consideration. While progressive deterioration is not common in schizophrenia, our relatively negative findings challenge the conclusions of some other longitudinal studies. Implications of our data on schizophrenic course are discussed. ",0
"A randomized clinical trial of scatter photocoagulation of proliferative sickle cell retinopathy. A randomized prospective clinical trial of argon laser scatter photocoagulation therapy for proliferative sickle cell retinopathy was performed on 116 patients (174 eyes) in Kingston, Jamaica. Ninety-nine eyes were treated with scatter photocoagulation and 75 eyes served as controls. The average length of follow-up was 42 months for the control eyes and 47 months for the treated eyes. Prolonged loss of visual acuity was statistically significantly reduced in the treated eyes. The incidence of vitreous hemorrhage was also significantly reduced in the treated eyes after controlling for the previously defined risk factors of vitreous hemorrhage and extent of proliferative sickle cell retinopathy at entry into the study. There were no complications associated with argon laser scatter photocoagulation.

"Structural and ultrastructural study of the ovary in childhood leukemia after successful treatment. Ovarian biopsy specimens from ten girls (three postmenarcheal) who had undergone antiblastic treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and were in complete remission were examined by light microscope. The biopsy specimens from four of these patients (three postmenarcheal) were also observed by electron microscope. The structural and ultrastructural analysis showed a reduction in the number of follicles which were otherwise normal. No follicles were found in the thin sections from two of the three postmenarcheal girls, whereas normal follicles were observed in the third. The cortical stroma showed moderate to severe signs of fibrosis and changes of capillaries. All of these alterations were more evident in patients where ALL was diagnosed at an older age and this finding suggests that they are at a higher risk for low fertility or early menopause. ",0
Scleral buckle revision to treat recurrent rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. Recurrent rhegmatogenous retinal detachment sometimes occurs following scleral buckling surgery in the absence of advanced proliferative vitreoretinopathy (grade C-2 or greater). Such detachments can occur because: 1) the scleral buckle is not properly positioned beneath the original break; 2) the buckle is not high enough; 3) the break is elevated off the buckle due to progressive vitreous traction; 4) there are new breaks; and 5) chorioretinal adhesion is insufficient. Techniques that may be useful for reattaching the retina in these cases include: 1) adding scleral buckling material to augment the original buckle; 2) modifying the existing buckle without adding new material; 3) replacing the original buckle with other material; 4) re-treating inadequately closed breaks; and 5) combinations of these four techniques. Vitrectomy may be avoided in many cases. ,0
"Essential fatty acid sufficiency does not preclude fat-soluble-vitamin deficiency in short-bowel syndrome. Patients with extensive small-bowel resection may experience malabsorption and nutrient deficiencies. We evaluated the ability to absorb fat and fat-soluble vitamins in a short-gut patient. For 18 wk after stopping intravenous lipid, while consuming a low-lactose, low-fat diet, he exhibited no clinical manifestations of essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD). Serum 20:4n-6 (20:4 omega-6) and 18:2n-6 fatty acid concentrations were normal, whereas the concentration of 20:3n-9 remained less than or equal to 0.1% of total serum fatty acids. Although serum vitamin A was normal, beta-carotene was undetectable despite oral supplementation. Prothrombin time was elevated until parenteral vitamin K was given. This patient has fat absorption adequate to prevent EFAD but inadequate absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. In patients with short bowel, the requirements for parenteral lipids and fat-soluble vitamins should be determined independently. ",0
"Results of treatment of persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous. The records of 48 patients with persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV) were reviewed. Approximately 17% had vision of 20/100 or better after surgery, contact lens fitting, and amblyopia therapy. Only eyes with a purely anterior presentation had successful visual outcomes. Lensectomy alone prevented glaucoma, but a membranectomy as well was required to ensure a successful visual result. Eyes with a posterior PHPV had poor visual results because of posterior pole abnormalities. I recommend that an attempt be made to visually salvage eyes with an anterior presentation. Eyes with a posterior or a combination anterior-posterior PHPV can be successfully treated for glaucoma, but the visual results will be poor. ",0
"The internal oblique-iliac crest free flap in composite defects of the oral cavity involving bone, skin, and mucosa. The reconstruction of oromandibular defects following ablative surgery is a challenging undertaking. When the defect involves skin as well as mucosa, the challenge becomes even greater. The internal oblique iliac crest osteomyocutaneous free flap is particularly useful for reconstruction of through-and-through composite defects due to the inclusion of two separate soft-tissue flaps on the same vascular pedicle. We report our experience with this flap in the reconstruction of 10 patients with such defects. The utility, and the limitations of this form of reconstruction are discussed in detail. ",0
"The management of atypical non-cardiac chest pain. Atypical, non-cardiac chest pain is common and disabling, and often persists despite negative medical investigations. Aetiology is disputed and management is difficult. A multi-causal model in which both psychological and physical factors play a part is helpful; a fundamental factor is continued misinterpretation of minor physical symptoms as evidence of heart disease. We report supportive evidence and describe a psychological treatment derived from the model. In a randomized trial, cognitive behavioural methods were effective in reducing chest pain, disability and use of medication, in patients both with and without psychiatric disorder. The clinical implications are discussed. ",0
"Cardiovascular risk reduction: the role of antihypertensive treatment. The effects of antihypertensive drugs on mortality from stroke, coronary artery disease (CAD), and nonvascular causes have been studied in 14 trials involving more than 37,000 patients. In the treated patients, blood pressure was 5 to 6 mm Hg lower than that in placebo-treated patients, and whereas mortality from stroke was reduced by 42%, CAD mortality was reduced by only 14%. A major reason for this lack of effect on CAD mortality is apparently the adverse effects of the primary drugs used in these trials (diuretics and beta blockers) on glucose tolerance, lipid levels, and insulin resistance. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors favorably influence many CAD risk factors, and their use can be expected to reduce CAD mortality in patients treated for hypertension. ",0
"Mobile knee reconstructions after resection of malignant tumors of the distal femur. Limb-salvage surgery involving mobile knee reconstructions for malignant tumors about the distal femur is a desirable and achievable goal. With limb salvage, the survival rate does not decrease significantly, and the resulting function is superior to when an amputation plus a prosthesis are used. Immediate and delayed morbidity is greater after limb-salvage surgery than after amputation. However, with thorough preoperative planning, use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy as indicated, and an experienced team of surgeons, limb-salvage surgery can provide a mobile knee with excellent function in the vast majority of cases for patients with malignant tumors of the distal femur.

"Factors predicting satisfactory home care after stroke. This study prospectively investigated factors predicting optimal poststroke home care. One hundred and thirty-five first occurrence stroke patients and their primary support persons were evaluated during the initial hospitalization after stroke and again one year poststroke. Discriminant function analysis was used to identify two groups from the baseline data: home care situations which were rated optimal and those which were not. Group membership was predicted and validated with 72.6% accuracy. Patients at risk for less than optimal home care had caregivers who were (1) more likely to be depressed, (2) less likely to be married to the patient, (3) below average in knowledge about stroke care, and (4) reporting more family dysfunction. Our findings suggest that caregiver-related problems can have a collective effect on rehabilitation outcome and that treatment should reduce caregiver depression, minimize family dysfunction, and increase the family's knowledge about stroke care.

"Homeobox gene expression plus autocrine growth factor production elicits myeloid leukemia. In the murine myelomonocytic leukemia WEHI-3B, proviral insertions have induced expression of the Hox-2.4 homeobox gene and the gene for the myeloid growth factor interleukin 3 (IL-3). To assess their potential oncogenic role, normal bone marrow cells were infected with retroviruses bearing the genes for IL-3 or IL-3 plus Hox-2.4. Unlike the IL-3 virus, the IL-3/Hox-2.4 virus was highly leukemogenic. Infected cells expressing both genes exhibited retarded differentiation in vitro, generated myelomonocytic cell lines, and provoked a rapid, transplantable myeloid leukemia in vivo. The oncogenic action of Hox-2.4 appears to derive from its ability to impede the IL-3-driven terminal differentiation of myeloid cells. The results suggest that homeobox genes can regulate key differentiation processes such as self-renewal capacity and that their inappropriate expression can be oncogenic. ",0
"Alteration of platelet serotonin in patients with chronic tension-type headache during cold pressor test. Change of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) concentrations in platelets from patients with chronic tension-type headache (TH) and controls were observed during cold pressor test (CPT). Before cold stimulation, 5-HT concentrations in platelets from patients with TH were significantly lower than those found in controls. One minute after the start of cold stimulation, 5-HT levels in platelets from patients with TH were significantly much lower than in the controls, as control levels rose and TH levels fell. The results show that, under stress, the absorbance of 5-HT into the platelets in patients with TH is reduced. It is suggested that, in patients with TH, there are abnormalities of 5-HT uptake into platelets and factors which cause release of 5-HT from platelets. ",0
"Eosinophilic fasciitis associated with tryptophan ingestion. A manifestation of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. Recently, the ingestion of tryptophan has been associated with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, which is characterized by eosinophilia, myalgias, and several less consistently reported findings. We treated 13 patients who exhibited clinical features of eosinophilic fasciitis who were taking high-dose tryptophan before the onset of clinical symptoms. Twelve patients exhibited eosinophilia, with eosinophil counts ranging from 0.13 to 0.88. The remaining patient was taking oral corticosteroids when her eosinophil count was determined. Eight patients complained of myalgias. Other symptoms included arthralgias, pruritus, cutaneous burning, weakness, fever, rashes, malaise, edema, muscle spasms, and alopecia. 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels were elevated in four of the eight urine specimens that were tested. Our findings suggest that previously diagnosed cases of eosinophilic fasciitis may represent variants of tryptophan-associated eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. Derangements in the metabolism of tryptophan may play a role in sclerotic diseases. ",0
"Dysphagia following fundoplication: ""slipped"" fundoplication versus achalasia complicated by fundoplication. Failure to obtain preoperative esophageal manometry in patients being considered for antireflux surgery can result in immediate persistent postoperative dysphagia due to a missed diagnosis of achalasia. We describe the clinical assessment and management of a case of delayed postoperative dysphagia due to a ""slipped"" fundoplication, which is contrasted with three patients with immediate postoperative dysphagia due to a missed diagnosis of achalasia. Surgical revision was required to correct the ""slipped"" fundoplication, and pneumatic dilatation was successfully used in two of three cases of achalasia complicated by fundoplication. Careful preoperative esophageal evaluation with manometry is essential to rule out the presence of a primary esophageal motor disorder. ",0
"Total hip arthroplasty with cement. A long-term radiographic analysis in patients who are older than fifty and younger than fifty years. The long-term performance of a total of 712 Charnley and STH prostheses was evaluated as a function of the patient's age (older than fifty years or younger than fifty years) and of the underlying disease (osteoarthrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, or avascular necrosis). In patients who were older than fifty years, there were lower incidences of continuous cement-bone radiolucency about the acetabular component (p = 0.04), wear of the polyethylene acetabular cup (p = 0.03), and resorption of the calcar (p = 0.03). However, larger percentages of younger patients had rheumatoid arthritis or avascular necrosis. In the cohort of patients who had osteoarthrosis, the performance of the prosthesis did not differ significantly between older and younger patients; therefore we attributed the differences that were observed to the disease--that is, to rheumatoid arthritis or avascular necrosis.

"Malignant potential of juvenile polyposis coli. Report of a case and review of the literature. Juvenile polyps of the colon and rectum traditionally have been viewed as being benign inflammatory or harmartomatous lesions without potential for malignant change. The authors report a case of adenocarcinoma developing in a patient with sporadic juvenile polyposis. Juvenile polyposis was diagnosed in the patient at age 4 years. He underwent subtotal colectomy at age 6 years. At age 12, he underwent a proctectomy and a Swenson pull-through because of adenomatous changes in the rectal stump. At age 19 surveillance endoscopy revealed invasive cancer in a juvenile polyp. ",0
"Recurrence of resected esophagogastric adenocarcinoma: results of re-resection. Isolated local recurrence following potentially curative resection for carcinoma of the esophagus or esophagogastric junction does not necessarily imply pending systemic disease and early demise. While radiation alone or in combination with chemotherapy is standard treatment for such patients, resection is another available option. Resection may also be a consideration should localized disease persist after non-operative therapy in the absence of metastases. A 5 year retrospective review was performed examining 204 resections performed prior to 1989. Only 5 patients underwent resection of locally recurrent esophagogastric (EG) adenocarcinoma during this period. No squamous carcinoma recurrences were resected. One patient is well 15 months later while another died at 18 months of other causes without recurrence. Recurrence after re-resection occurred at 8, 11, and 24 months in the 3 other patients. Although there were no postoperative deaths, major complications occurred in 4 patients. All 5 patients swallowed normally after operation. ",0
"Extrageniculate vision in hemianopic humans: saccade inhibition by signals in the blind field. The functional competence of extrageniculate visual pathways in hemianopic humans was demonstrated by showing that distractor signals in the blind half of the visual field could inhibit saccades toward targets in the intact visual field. This inhibitory effect of unseen distractors in patients occurred only when distractors were presented in the temporal half of the visual field, was specific to oculomotor responses, and did not occur in normal subjects. These results show that a peripheral visual signal activates retinotectal pathways to prime the oculomotor system and that these pathways can mediate orienting behavior in hemianopic humans. ",0
"Sensory ataxic hemiparesis in thalamic hemorrhage. Ataxic hemiparesis with cerebellar-like features has been reported following infarction or hemorrhage of the thalamus. We describe five patients with incoordination and corticospinal tract signs in the limbs opposite a dorsolateral thalamic hemorrhage. In four patients the hemorrhage extended superiorly into the lateral ventricle, the adjacent paraventricular region, and the upper and medial parts of the posterior limb of the internal capsule. Instead of cerebellar dysfunction, these patients exhibited directional errors of movement that improved distinctly when performed under visual guidance. We explain the incoordination on the basis of conscious deep sensory loss in the involved limbs. Perception of light touch, painful pinprick, and temperature were preserved in all patients. We use the term ""sensory ataxic hemiparesis"" to distinguish these patients from those with ""classic"" ataxic hemiparesis and cerebellar-like features, a distinction that may be important when planning functional rehabilitation.

"IgD immune complex vasculitis in a patient with hyperimmunoglobulinemia D and periodic fever. We describe a 27-year-old Dutch woman with the hyperimmunoglobulinemia D and periodic fever syndrome. During febrile attacks she occasionally presented with skin lesions on the distal parts of her upper and lower extremities, with the histologic picture of a leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Clear perivascular deposits of IgD and C3 were presented in early lesional skin on immunofluorescence investigation. Circulating IgD immune complexes were demonstrated on several occasions, both during and in between clinical attacks. These findings are consistent with an IgD immune complex-mediated pathogenesis for the skin lesions. In 10 patients with other forms of immune complex vasculitis of the skin, minimal perivascular deposits of IgD were found in four cases. In these cases, however, IgD was never found as the solitary immunoglobulin class. ",0
"Repetitive conservative surgery for recurrence of endometriosis. We evaluated the recovery of fertility and the relief of pain symptoms in a long-term follow-up of 42 women undergoing repetitive conservative surgery for recurrent endometriosis. The mean age of the patients was 31.1 +/- 4.3 years. At the time of their second operation the disease was stage IV in 14 women, stage III in 25, and stage I in three. After reoperation, the patients were followed for a mean period of 41.8 +/- 30.3 months. Pain symptoms returned in eight women, dysmenorrhea and deep dyspareunia in eight, and pelvic pain in seven. Eight of the 28 women (28.6%) who attempted to conceive achieved a total of 13 pregnancies. The corrected pregnancy rate was 35%, and the cumulative rate at 27 months was 30.7%. A third operation was necessary in six women after a mean period of 35 months. Conservative surgery is an effective therapeutic option for infertile patients with recurrent endometriosis. ",0
"The single-breath nitrogen test, mortality, and cancer. The relationship between indices of the single-breath nitrogen test and mortality, overall cancer incidence, and respiratory cancer incidence was examined in a cohort of 876 men, 46 to 69 yr of age, examined in 1974 and followed until June 1985. Closing volume, closing capacity, and slope of phase III were not related to mortality or cancer. In contrast, FEV1 was related to mortality, with an estimated relative mortality risk of 1.37 (95% confidence interval, 1.11 to 1.70) per liter under the expected FEV1, given height, age, and smoking, but FEV1 was not related to cancer. Inability to perform acceptable single-breath nitrogen test tracings was related to mortality with a relative mortality risk of 2.03 (1.45 to 2.85), but not to cancer. We conclude that indices of the single-breath nitrogen test have no predictive value concerning overall mortality and cancer incidence. ",0
"How long can a coronary reperfusion catheter be placed in acute coronary occlusion following failed transluminal coronary angioplasty? A case report. A coronary reperfusion catheter (CRC) is designed to preserve antegrade coronary flow when abrupt coronary closure occurs during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Insertion of the catheter to an occluded coronary artery for a few hours has been reported to be effective for myocardial salvage: however, it is unknown how long the catheter can be kept in place without causing extension of myocardial ischemia. The authors experienced a case in which the CRC was kept in place for twenty-four hours for anticoagulant therapy of an occluded coronary artery following failure of PTCA. This case suggests that adequate anticoagulant therapy can prolong the period during which a CRC can be kept in place if emergency coronary bypass surgery cannot be performed immediately after failure of coronary angioplasty.

"Ventricular arrhythmias in ischemic heart disease. Ventricular arrhythmias remain the leading cause of death from coronary artery disease. This review summarizes current thinking in several areas relating to the pathophysiology, prognosis, and therapy of ventricular arrhythmias associated with acute and chronic coronary artery disease syndromes. The experimental basis of arrhythmias in the setting of acute myocardial ischemia and chronic myocardial infarction is described, stressing the important pathophysiologic differences between these two conditions. The effects of the autonomic nervous system as a key modulator of ischemic arrhythmogenesis are discussed. Insights, derived from endocardial mapping studies, into the nature of ventricular tachycardia in humans with chronic myocardial infarction are described, including implications for risk stratification and therapy to prevent arrhythmia recurrence. Current therapeutic principles are discussed in the management of ventricular arrhythmias associated with coronary artery disease, including pharmacologic approaches, surgical and catheter ablation, and automatic implantable cardioverting and defibrillating devices.

"The acute and insidious onset of pulmonary metastatic transitional cell carcinoma. Transitional cell carcinoma is a common urologic neoplasm. Although pulmonary metastases from this tumor are often not appreciated clinically, they are frequently documented in autopsy studies. Therefore, the clinical recognition of this condition can be problematic. To illustrate this point, we present three patients with progressive unexplained dyspnea and histories of transitional cell carcinoma. Since ineffective and possibly detrimental therapeutic approaches may be initiated, a high index of suspicion for pulmonary metastatic embolization must be maintained. Early histologic identification of these metastatic emboli and initiation of effective chemotherapy may prove beneficial for improved quality of life. ",0
"Using a state cancer registry to increase screening behaviors of sisters and daughters of breast cancer patients. The Pennsylvania Cancer Registry was used to contact breast cancer patients and, through them, their adult sisters and daughters. The sisters and daughters were counseled concerning their higher than average risks for breast cancer and their need for mammography and breast self-examination. Results showed a 9 percent increase in mammography and a 10 percent increase in breast self-examination rates for the counseled over control group. Costs were $49 per counseled sister or daughter indicating a need to increase cost effectiveness before implementation is practical. ",0
"A tongue force measurement system for the assessment of oral-phase swallowing disorders. A computer-aided measuring system using a highly sensitive beam transducer has been developed to provide a quantitative, reliable measure of tongue strength. This tool has application in both the diagnosis and treatment of dysphagic patients with oral-stage dysfunction. The device is customized to comfortably adapt to each individual. Audiovisual feedback is used to enhance subject interest and motivation. The device has proven reliable in measurements of upward and side tongue thrust in six able-bodied subjects measured during five separate sessions. It has also been used with two dysphagic patients.

Misdiagnosis of the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome due to hyperlipidemia. Most authorities feel that diagnosis of the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is established when the serum gastrin level is greater than 1000 pg/mL (1000 ng/L) in a patient with gastric acid hypersecretion and clinical manifestations consistent with the diagnosis. A patient with recurrent peptic ulcer disease is reported who was thought to have had the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome based on two serum gastrin level measurements greater than 1000 pg/mL (1000 ng/L). Subsequent evaluation revealed the gastrin elevation to be spurious because the sample was hyperlipidemic. Lipemic serum samples may yield falsely elevated serum gastrin determinations as determined by radioimmunoassay. ,0
"Heart transplantation in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension and increased pulmonary vascular resistance. Irreversibly increased pulmonary vascular resistance is a contraindication for cardiac transplantation. At our hospital patients referred for recipient evaluation with systolic pulmonary artery pressure greater than 50 mmHg and pulmonary vascular resistance greater than 2 Wood units (Wu) are tested with intravenous sodium nitroprusside for reversibility. In 23 patients whose increased systolic pulmonary artery pressure (67.4 +/- 10.4 mmHg) and resistance (4.8 +/- 2.4 Wu) were reduced by nitroprusside, orthotopic heart transplantation was performed without early mortality. Right heart catheterization after transplantation revealed a significant and persistent fall of the elevated pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance. We conclude that if severe pulmonary hypertension and elevated pulmonary vascular resistance are reversible with nitroprusside, the patient can safely undergo heart transplantation. ",0
"Epidemiology of acute respiratory tract infections among Guatemalan ambulatory preschool children. Acute respiratory tract infections (ARI) were studied during a 2-year period in 521 preschool children living in a marginal area of Guatemala City. There were 3,646 episodes of ARI detected during 26,329 child-weeks at risk, for an incidence of 14 per 100 child-weeks or 7.2 episodes per child per year. The median duration of ARI episodes was 11 days. The highest incidence of ARI was observed in children 6-23 months old. Boys had more respiratory tract illnesses than did girls; the presence of a cigarette smoker in the household was associated with higher morbidity. Acute lower respiratory tract illnesses (ALRI) were more common among younger infants 0-5 months old, with nutritional status having no apparent effect. Parental formal education and crowding in households were found to be directly related to the incidence of ALRI. In general, ARI morbidity interfered with appropriate physical growth. ",0
"Dacron fabric-enveloped hydroxyapatite prosthesis for sternal tumor defect: an autopsy report. A 38-year-old housewife with solitary plasmacytoma of the manubrium who underwent a subtotal sternectomy treated by resection of the lesion is reported. This was followed by replacement with a Dacron fabric-enveloped hydroxyapatite prosthesis. The Dacron fabric was sutured to the surrounding tissues, and then the clavicle was passed through the cylindrical-shaped Dacron fabric to form a sternoclavicular joint capsule. The patient returned to her daily life 3 months after the operation. She had no trouble in her daily living, without any dislocation of the sternoclavicular joints or any displacement of the artificial sternum. The autopsy examination about 1 year after the operation showed that the Dacron fabric enveloping the artificial sternum became stronger with time. The sternoclavicular joint also was stably fixed, and the Dacron fabric fulfilled its function as an artificial articular capsule and biologic fixation of the surrounding supporting tissues. ",0
"Recovery of CD3+ and CD5- lymphocyte subpopulation after autologous bone marrow transplantation and chemotherapy. Although most circulating T cells in normal subjects express both CD3 and CD5 antigens on the cell surface, a small number lack the CD5 antigen. Recipients of allogeneic bone marrow transplants develop increased numbers of CD3+ CD5- cells, particularly those who develop graft versus host disease (GVHD). This CD3+ CD5- population may rise transiently in patients who have received an autologous bone marrow transplant (BMT) and in patients following completion of intensive chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). These findings suggest that these CD3+ CD5- cells are a normal component of the regenerating lymphoid system after BMT or chemotherapy. ",0
"MRI findings in neuro-Behcet's disease. We report MRI findings in 6 patients with Behcet's disease and CNS involvement. There were 3 different stages of imaging appearance: (1) During the acute illness, there were scattered areas of high signal intensity on T2-weighted images with predilection to the central structures of the cerebrum, the cerebral peduncles, and basis pontis. (2) During the recovery phase, most of these findings improved, but some white matter high signal areas persisted in the upper brainstem and peripheral subcortical white matter. Occasionally, findings were suggestive of microhematoma. (3) During the chronic phase, atrophy of posterior fossa structures became evident with decreased signal intensity suggestive of hemosiderin deposits. ",0
"Dysgeusia, gustatory sweating, and crocodile tears syndrome induced by a cerebellopontine angle meningioma. Facial nerve involvement in cerebellopontine angle tumors, both during their development and after excision, may be expressed in irreversible dysfunction of the parasympathetic pathways. The exact location of the lesion along the efferent nerve fibers can be established through evaluation of the functional level of those organs supplied by the cholinergic motor secretory components. This report deals with a female patient in whom peripheral facial palsy developed shortly after removal of a right cerebellopontine angle meningioma. She had slight facial asymmetry and deafness in the right ear and complained of prandial flush and sweating of the right malar area. Occult ipsilateral hyposalivation and hypolacrimation were diagnosed. In patients with seventh and ninth cranial nerve pathoses, evaluation of the end organs that are supplied by their associated autonomous nerve fibers is mandatory to prevent late ocular and oral sequelae.

Islet cell carcinoma of the pancreas presenting as bleeding from isolated gastric varices. Report of a case and review of the literature. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage from left-sided portal hypertension and gastric varices is an unusual presentation for islet cell carcinoma of the pancreas. Islet cell tumors of the pancreas themselves are rare. They present in a variety of ways. Those that elaborate functional hormones cause specific neuroendocrine syndromes. Nonfunctional tumors characteristically present later with symptoms of metastatic disease or as a result of local enlargement. We present a case of islet cell carcinoma of the pancreas presenting with recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding from gastric varices and review the literature for this rare presentation. We emphasize the importance of a careful initial diagnostic work-up that may enable curative surgery. ,0
"The long-term effects of radiation therapy on patients with ovarian dysgerminoma. A retrospective chart review and questionnaire study was undertaken to look at the long-term effects of radiation therapy in ovarian dysgerminoma patients. Forty-three patients and 55 controls responded to a questionnaire that detailed bowel, bladder, thyroid, menstrual, reproductive, sexual, and growth function. Statistically significant differences in the number of bowel movements were noticed when comparing patients with controls. The authors noticed no significant differences between cases and controls in bladder function. No thyroid disorders were attributable to mediastinal radiation therapy. Most patients with intact uteri bleed monthly on hormonal replacement. Three patients with a remaining ovary and uterus resumed menstrual function after substantial doses of abdominopelvic radiation therapy. No patients have conceived. The authors noticed a slight increase in dyspareunia in the treated group, but most patients were satisfied with their sexual function. One premenarchal patient exhibited a growth disorder. ",0
"Adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder. A premalignant lesion? Gallbladder cancer is the most common malignant tumor of the biliary tract, but its early diagnosis is uncommon. The use of ultrasonography has increased the detection of benign gallbladder tumors, and the premalignant potential of gallbladder adenomas is now undisputed. Adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder has recently been suggested to have malignant potential, and we report a case of adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder occurring in localized adenomyomatosis that was successfully treated by radical curative surgery. The more rigorous use of ultrasonography and a more aggressive approach to ""benign"" polypoid lesions of the gallbladder may represent the best way of achieving early diagnosis and cure in gallbladder cancer.

"Evidence of heterogeneous mechanisms in lipoprotein lipid alterations in hyperandrogenic women. Fifty-one hyperandrogenic women had their lipoprotein lipid profiles determined. Free and albumin-bound testosterone was associated with triglycerides and with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol independent of fasting insulin levels, percent ideal body weight, and waist/hip ratio. To gain insight into mechanisms of these lipid alterations, the women were subgrouped according to apparent source of androgen excess. Whereas all groups had low levels of high-density lipoprotein-2 cholesterol and high triglyceride concentrations, only in those with high luteinizing hormone-to-follicle-stimulating hormone ratios was free and albumin-bound testosterone associated with triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol independent of fasting insulin levels. Relationships between percent ideal body weight and waist/hip ratios, free and albumin-bound testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin, fasting insulin and 2-hour insulin levels and blood pressure are not significant in all subgroups, suggesting differing endocrinological influences and differing mechanisms for lipoprotein lipid alterations.

"Brain abscess associated with congenital pulmonary arteriovenous fistula. A case of brain abscess associated with congenital pulmonary arteriovenous fistula was presented and 52 reported cases were reviewed. The brain abscess was successfully treated with repeated aspiration and drainage, and the pulmonary arteriovenous fistula, located in the right lower lobe, was resected. The arteriovenous fistula occurs as a common pulmonary manifestation of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia; however, no symptoms suggesting these two were noted in this case. Brain abscesses can be an initial clinical manifestation in asymptomatic pulmonary arteriovenous fistula. This possible association should be borne in mind in cases of brain abscesses of unexplained etiology. ",0
"Impaired awareness of behavioral limitations after traumatic brain injury. Sixty-four traumatically brain injured patients were divided into three groups. Patients in Group I overestimated their behavioral competencies. Patients in Group II showed behavioral ratings similar to relatives' reports concerning behavioral competencies. Patients in Group III underestimated their behavioral competencies. Group I patients had greater evidence of bilateral and multiple-site lesions than group II and III patients. Speed of left-hand finger tapping was also worse in Group I than groups II and III, but other standard neuropsychologic test findings failed to separate the groups. Specific brain lesion sites were not related to group membership. Impaired awareness of behavioral limitations after traumatic brain injury may be related to neuropsychologic changes not measured by standard tests. Bilateral impairment of heteromodal cortex may be important to this phenomenon when it exists several months or years postinjury. ",0
"Beneficial effects of colestipol-niacin on coronary atherosclerosis. A 4-year follow-up. The Cholesterol Lowering Atherosclerosis Study (CLAS) was a randomized, placebo-controlled, angiographic trial testing combined colestipol-niacin therapy in 162 subjects. Two-year results (CLAS-I) showed decreased atherosclerosis progression and increased regression. We now describe a subgroup of 103 subjects treated for 4 years (CLAS-II). Changes in blood lipid, lipoprotein-cholesterol, and apolipoprotein levels were maintained, and at 4 years significantly more drug-treated subjects demonstrated nonprogression (52% drug- vs 15% placebo-treated) and regression (18% drug- vs 6% placebo-treated) in native coronary artery lesions. Significantly fewer drug-treated subjects developed new lesions in native coronary arteries (14% drug- vs 40% placebo-treated) and bypass grafts (16% drug- vs 38% placebo-treated). These results confirm CLAS-I findings and indicate that regression can continue for 4 years. They reaffirm the need for early initiation of vigorous long-term lipid lowering therapy in coronary bypass subjects. ",0
"Mechanism of intermittent preexcitation in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. The concept of electronically mediated conduction across an inexcitable gap. A man with intermittent preexcitation in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is reported. Once a sinus impulse was blocked in the accessory pathway, the block (ie, loss of preexcitation) was continued for a while until a PP interval reached or exceeded a critical period inducing sudden reappearance of preexcitation. This critical period was considerably longer than the effective refractory period of the accessory pathway. These findings are explained by the use of the concept of electronically mediated conduction across an inexcitable gap in the accessory pathway. It seems that when loss of protection was maintained, the sinus impulse was blocked at the site proximal to the gap, but the impulse passing through the atrioventricular node always reached retrogradely the site distal to the gap, and therefore, the next sinus impulse was blocked again.

"The reproducibility of intravascular ultrasound imaging in vitro. To determine which factors may affect the image quality when an intravascular ultrasound catheter is used in vivo, the influence of blood, temperature change, and contrast media were evaluated. In addition, to confirm the reproducibility of intravascular ultrasound imaging to measure cross-sectional lumen area, intraobserver and interobserver variability were determined. The findings indicated that ultrasound images in blood are mildly attenuated, that changes from room temperature to body temperature do not have a significant impact on the image quality, that contrast media attenuates the image intensity in a dose-dependent manner, and that the intravascular ultrasound imaging catheter provides a reproducible method for measuring arterial lumen area with excellent intraobserver and interobserver correlation.

"Window operation: an alternative treatment method for Bartholin gland cysts and abscesses Recently, we developed the ""window operation"" as a more effective way to treat Bartholin gland cysts and abscesses. The window operation was used to treat 25 Bartholin cysts and 22 Bartholin abscesses during a 3-year period from October 1, 1986 to September 30, 1989. Under local anesthesia, a small piece of skin including the cyst wall was excised in an oval shape, and suturing was performed along the excised margin. Postoperative antibiotics were given in cases of acute inflammation. A new mucocutaneous junction was observed at the 4-week postoperative checkup. No complications or recurrences have been observed during the study period. The window operation can be an alternative method of treatment for Bartholin gland cysts or abscesses. ",0
"Hepatitis B virus nucleocapsid/pre-S2 fusion proteins expressed in attenuated Salmonella for oral vaccination. Hybrid HBV nucleocapsid-pre-S(2) fusion proteins were stably expressed in several aromatic-dependent attenuated Salmonella typhimurium and Salmonella dublin strains. When these live recombinant bacteria were administered i.p. to BALB/c mice they induced high titer anti-hepatitis B virus core Ag (HBc) and detectable anti-pre-S2 serum antibodies. Upon oral feeding of the recombinant salmonellae to mice, the rate of seroconversion to anti-HBc was dependent on the salmonella strain used. With the best carrier strain high titer anti-HBc antibodies and lower titer anti-pre-S2 serum IgG antibodies were observed two weeks after a single oral immunization. The Ig class and IgG subclass distribution of anti-HBc antibodies after i.p. and oral immunization is consistent with the induction of functional T cell help. ",0
"Lateral medullary infarction: prognosis in an unselected series. We describe the acute and long-term prognosis in 43 patients with lateral medullary infarction (LMI) collected from a population-based stroke registry from 1982 to July 1988. Mean age was 63.9 years and median time of follow-up was 33 months. In the acute phase, 5 patients (11.6%) died from respiratory and cardiovascular complications and 2 new strokes occurred, both in the posterior circulation. During follow-up, recurrent vertebrobasilar territory strokes occurred in only 2 patients (a rate of 1.9% per year). The mechanisms of stroke were vertebral artery (VA) branch occlusion, causing a medial medullary syndrome, and basilar artery thrombosis propagating from a contralateral, distal VA stenosis. In the acute phase of LMI, respiratory and cardiovascular events, presumably caused by autonomic dysfunction related to the lateral medullary lesion, are the major hazards. Recurrent posterior circulation strokes were uncommon during follow-up. ",0
"Why are autism and the fragile-X syndrome associated? Conceptual and methodological issues. Investigations of the association between autism and the fragile-X syndrome have yielded conflicting results with some studies indicating a strong correlation and others indicating no relation between the disorders. In this paper, we review the relevant research on this controversy and discuss the conceptual and methodological problems involved in such an inquiry. We conclude that autism and fragile X are associated and that this relation will prove fruitful in understanding the role of the X chromosome in a variety of behavior disorders and in unraveling various theoretical accounts on the etiology of autism.

"The modified superior based pharyngeal flap. Part III. A retrospective study. A retrospective study of 31 patients who had diagnosed velopharyngeal incompetence and were surgically managed with the modified superior based pharyngeal flap was completed. The following were analyzed: age at time of operation, gender, physical status, diagnostic protocol, length of operation (length of total surgery) and length of superior based pharyngeal flap, length of postoperative hospital stay, length of total hospital stay, length of follow-up, speech results, complications, patient care, and medication. The result showed that the optimal timing for correction of velopharyngeal incompetence was between 3 and 6 years of age. The mean length of total hospital stay was 2.7 days, postoperative complications were minimal, and speech results were generally good. ",0
"Upper gastrointestinal pathology in familial adenomatous polyposis: results from a prospective study of 102 patients. Multiple gastric and duodenal biopsy specimens from 102 asymptomatic patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, taken during a prospective endoscopic screening programme were examined. One hundred patients had microscopic gastroduodenal pathology, often in the absence of macroscopic lesions. Adenomas were found in 94 patients in the duodenum, in the second and third parts. Hyperplasia of villous and crypt epithelium was also seen, sometimes in the absence of adenomas: this may be a precursor of neoplastic change. In the stomach fundic gland polyps were the commonest abnormality, seen microscopically in 44 patients. Chronic antral gastritis was common in patients without fundic polyps. Gastric adenomas were present in six patients, all of whom also had duodenal adenomas. If duodenal adenomas in familial adenomatous polyposis have a similar malignant potential to those in the colorectum sequential endoscopy and biopsy are necessary to detect cancer in these patients.

"Influence of otitis media on the correlation between rectal and auditory canal temperatures. In a noninterventional, controlled, single-blinded trial, 251 children were examined in a university hospital emergency department setting to study the influence of acute otitis media on the relationship between rectal and auditory canal temperatures. Bilateral auditory canal temperatures were measured using an infrared detection probe and microprocessor by nursing staff blinded to the presence of acute otitis media. Correlation between rectal and auditory canal temperatures in children with (r = .81) and without (r = .75) acute otitis media were not significantly different. There was no significant difference between infected (38.1 degrees C +/- 1.0 degree C) and uninfected ears (38.0 degrees C +/- 1.0 degree C) with unilateral otitis (n = 75). Although significantly higher than in uninfected children, auditory canal temperatures of children with acute otitis media reflected elevated rectal temperatures and not differences in auditory canal temperatures between ears.

"Systolic Hypertension of the Elderly Program (SHEP). Part 10: Analysis. The SHEP is a randomized, placebo-controlled trial that will follow standard clinical trial principles in analyzing data relating to its proposed hypotheses. The protocol has stated a priori the main objective as well as the secondary subgroup hypotheses. Sample size calculations for SHEP have accounted for dropins to and drop-outs from active therapy as well as for the risk of nonstroke death. The sample size achieved (4,736 participants) should be adequate to address the proposed questions. Monitoring procedures have been described and established. A data and safety monitoring board that uses these procedures is closely following the data from the trial. The board will periodically examine the data to determine whether termination of the study is warranted. ",0
"Chronic arterial occlusion with PGE1-resistant skin lesions treated by glycosaminoglycan compound--case reports. The authors report on 2 patients with chronic arterial occlusion in whom the intravenous administration of the glycosaminoglycan compound FPFD 101 was markedly effective. One patient suffered from thromboembolic episodes of the left hand, and the other had peripheral circulatory impairment related to collagen disease. In these patients, the oral administration of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents in combination with intravenous infusion of prostaglandin E1 was not adequately effective. However, the addition of intravenous injection of FPFD 101 resulted in a marked improvement in their symptoms. FPFD 101, which has an anticoagulant effect and also inhibits platelet aggregation, seems to be useful for the treatment and prevention of chronic arterial occlusion when combined with drugs such as anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, and vasodilators.

"Recurrence rate after discontinuation of long-term mebendazole therapy in alveolar echinococcosis (preliminary results). The recurrence rate was investigated in 19 patients with non-resectable alveolar echinococcosis after discontinuation of a long-term therapy with mebendazole (average treatment 4.3 years). A control group consisted of 14 patients who underwent radical surgery and finished a course of prophylactic postoperative mebendazole treatment of 2 years. In the controls, no recurrence was observed after a post-therapy period averaging 3.5 years. In contrast, recurrence occurred in 7/19 patients (37%) with non-resectable alveolar echinococcosis an average of 1.6 years after discontinuation of the long-term mebendazole therapy. The absence of clinically detectable recurrence in the remaining 12 patients seems to be due either to spontaneous inactivation of alveolar echinococcosis preceding chemotherapy or too short post-therapy surveillance. The patients with recurrence responded favorably to reintroduction of chemotherapy. The data indicate that mebendazole therapy is parasitostatic rather than parasiticidal. ",0
Life-threatening complications during anaesthesia in a patient with a ventriculo-atrial shunt and pulmonary hypertension [published erratum appears in Anaesthesia 1991 Mar;46(3):241] A 6-year-old patient with hydrocephalus who underwent revision of a ventriculo-atrial shunt is described. Anaesthesia was complicated by the occurrence of systemic hypertension and arterial hypoxaemia. The patient was subsequently found to have pulmonary hypertension secondary to recurrent pulmonary thromboembolism. The pathophysiological mechanisms for the patient's deterioration are discussed and the anaesthetic management of children with pulmonary hypertension is outlined. It is concluded that patients with a ventriculo-atrial shunt who present for surgery should be screened carefully for the presence of pulmonary hypertension. ,0
"Increase in native valve endocarditis caused by coagulase negative staphylococci: an Anglo-French clinical and microbiological study. Native valve endocarditis caused by coagulase negative staphylococci has become more common. A study of 35 cases showed that the infections were usually acquired in the community and occurred in men (mean age 51 years). A pre-existing cardiac abnormality (mitral leaflet prolapse in a third of patients) was detected in 26 (74%). The source of the organisms in the community acquired infections was assumed to be the skin, though lesions were seldom demonstrated; most hospital acquired infections resulted from intravenous devices. Community acquired organisms were usually sensitive to penicillin, whereas those acquired in hospital were often multiresistant. Most infections were caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis. The frequency of acute presentation (26%) and of major neurological abnormality (23%), together with the need for valve replacement (often emergency) (51%) and the mortality (36%) suggest that coagulase negative staphylococci can be virulent aggressive pathogens, mimicking Staphylococcus aureus.

"Endoscopic laser surgery. A single-center comprehensive experience. A retrospective review of endoscopic procedures using the Nd:YAG laser was carried out for patients treated between October 1985 and March 1989. During this 42-month period 165 procedures were performed on 100 patients. The study encompasses a unique period of time in this center, as it includes the initial application, and finally, the time when its use became routine. Indications for laser surgery included the treatment of tumors, bleeding, benign strictures, arterial occlusions, and hemorrhoids. Nd:YAG laser was found to be effective in the treatment of these lesions. The overall success rate was 81 per cent. Patients who are poor surgical candidates would especially benefit from this therapeutic alternative. ",0
"T cell subsets (Tc, Th, Ts, Tsi) and IL2 receptor-bearing cells in peripheral blood of patients in the acute phase of alcoholic hepatitis. The present study was designed to evaluate the proportion of T cell subsets and IL2 receptor positive cells in the peripheral blood of patients with acute alcoholic hepatitis (AAH) using monoclonal antibodies to T cell antigens and Tac in a double immunofluorescent technique. The results indicate that the percentage of the total T cells and the intensity of all the T cell antigens are significantly reduced and the percentage of T helper cells and the ratio between Th/Ts cells are significantly increased in AAH when compared to healthy controls. But, significant differences in values observed in this study were not found for the absolute number of these cells. These altered values returned to normal levels during convalescence. ",0
"Internuclear ophthalmoplegia in the Chiari type II malformation. We describe 3 cases of Chiari type II malformation presenting with bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO). Although prominent, the INO was not an isolated sign in any of the patients; superimposed abduction paresis was present in 2, and deficits in smooth pursuit, optokinetic nystagmus, and vestibulo-ocular responses were present in 3. Two had hydrocephalus: 1 was clinically unchanged without therapy after 5 years; the other did not improve with shunting. Findings in our 3 patients, along with the 4 previously reported, confirm that INO is 1 manifestation of widespread brainstem or cerebellar dysfunction. Its origin is probably multifactorial, related to hydrocephalus, vascular compromise, direct neuronal distortion, or congenital neural malformation. ",0
"Xeroderma pigmentosum: review and report of a case. Xeroderma pigmentosum is a rare inherited dermatosis that provides insight into the basic mechanism of carcinogenesis. It is a model disorder linking defective DNA repair with clinical abnormalities and neoplasia. UV light-induced damage to the skin begins early and results in multiple benign and malignant skin tumors, especially in sun-exposed areas of the head and neck. Oral cancers, primarily squamous cell carcinomas of the anterior third of the tongue, occur with greatly increased frequency. A patient with multiple facial neoplasia and oral manifestations of xeroderma pigmentosum is presented. The role of the dentist in surveillance of oral and perioral structures is emphasized. The dentist is advised against the use of UV light-curing units in these patients because UV-induced epithelial damage may cause dysplasia when DNA repair mechanisms are dysfunctional. ",0
"Radiation therapy for intraductal carcinoma. Is it an equal alternative? Of 213 consecutive patients with intraductal carcinoma, 109 were selectively treated with mastectomy and 104 with radiation therapy. There were eight local recurrences, seven in patients treated with radiation therapy and one in a patient treated with mastectomy. Histologically, there were 110 comedocarcinomas and 103 noncomedocarcinomas. Seven local recurrences occurred in patients with comedocarcinomas and one in a patient with a noncomedo tumor. Three (38%) of eight local recurrences (all comedo) were invasive. The 5-year actuarial survival for all subgroups was 100%. The median follow-up was 51 months. Intraductal carcinoma is unlikely to metastasize to axillary lymph nodes, and routine dissection is unnecessary. Ductal carcinoma in situ of the comedo variety is more aggressive and more likely to recur than its noncomedo counterpart. We currently view conservative therapy for patients with intraductal comedocarcinoma with caution. ",0
"Antibiotic pharmacokinetics in surgery Pharmacokinetics is the study of variables that affect drug concentrations at the effector site. The descriptive terms peak concentration, elimination half-life, volume of distribution, and bioavailability are commonly used to express pharmacokinetic variability among drugs used in patient care. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of drugs are important for surgeons to understand because they represent differences that may assume clinical significance when selecting antibiotics for preoperative preventive indications. In addition, the changing hemodynamic pattern of the stressed and septic patient may result in changing pharmacokinetic patterns for an antibiotic, which, in turn, may require changes in the dosing regimen during the course of treatment.

"The use of molecular probes to distinguish new primary tumors from recurrent tumors in gynecologic malignancies. This is the first report using DNA molecular probe technology to distinguish between recurrent tumor and a second primary malignancy in a patient. Tumor DNA was extracted from squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix at the time of radical hysterectomy. Eighteen months later a squamous cell cancer was found in a vaginal apex biopsy from which DNA was extracted. Tumor DNA from both lesions was subjected to restriction enzyme digestion and DNA molecular hybridization with human papillomavirus (HPV) probes. Although both lesions were positive for HPV 16, their respective restriction enzyme patterns had different HPV genetic arrangements, thereby demonstrating their distinctness. ",0
"Reinforcement of incontinent stools in the treatment of encopresis. In this paper, fecal incontinence and constipation were treated in two mentally retarded individuals using a novel intervention wherein incontinent stools were first rewarded in order to increase the frequency of bowel movements. This intervention was implemented only after more traditional pediatric and behavioral treatments were unsuccessful. The reinforcement of incontinent stools procedure resulted in an increase in both the frequency and the number of continent stools for both individuals. Hypotheses regarding the failure of previous treatments and the success of the current treatment are discussed as well as directions for future research. ",0
"Articulatory impairment associated with tardive dyskinesia. The speech of two patients with tardive dyskinesia was studied, and one neuroleptic-treated patient having no signs of overt tardive dyskinesia served as control. A structured interview, including reading, repetition of sentences, and spontaneous conversation, was performed. A phonetic transcription and analysis of abnormal phonemes was done by a linguist under blind conditions. Both patients with tardive dyskinesia had abnormal phonemes whereas the control patient had none. These differences could not be explained by age, direct neuroleptic effect, or neuroleptic exposure time. The abnormal phonemes were all consonants. The authors conclude that tardive dyskinesia may cause articulatory communication problems. ",0
"Comparison of pulse oximeters: accuracy at low arterial pressure in volunteers. A laboratory model was developed of limb hypoperfusion in volunteers, using parital occlusion of the brachial artery with consequent reduction in radial artery pulse pressure. This was used to compare the function of 13 pulse oximeters and the effect of reduced pulse pressure and mild hypoxia on these devices. With the exception of one device, all the pulse oximeters studied demonstrated similar accuracies at pulse pressures exceeding 20 mm Hg. There were however, significant differences between several of the pulse oximeters in both ability to display readings and accuracy of readings displayed when brachial artery occlusion reduced radial artery pulse pressures equal to or less than 20 mm Hg.

"Ovarian granulosa-stromal cell tumors are characterized by trisomy 12. Eleven ovarian granulosa-stromal cell tumors including 1 thecoma, 2 fibromas, 6 fibrothecomas, and 2 granulosa cell tumors, were karyotyped after direct harvest and/or short-term tissue culture. Bilateral fibrothecomas from one patient appeared to lack cytogenetic aberrations: the remaining nine tumors were characterized by trisomy for chromosome 12. Cytogenetic aberrations in the two granulosa cell tumors were much less complex than those described previously in undifferentiated carcinomas; accordingly cytogenetic analyses might be useful in distinguishing these categories. The consistent occurrence of trisomy 12 in different varieties of granulosa-stromal cell tumors suggests a common mechanism of oncogenesis within this diverse group of neoplasms. That mechanism probably involves promotion of low-grade, orderly cell proliferation. ",0
"Pharmacodynamics in cancer therapy. Our understanding of anticancer pharmacodynamics, and the relationships between pharmacologic measurements and clinical effects, has grown markedly in recent years due to advances in analytical and computational technology. Although methotrexate plasma levels have been empirically used to guide leucovorin dosing during high-dose methotrexate therapy, there has been no other standard use of therapeutic drug monitoring in oncology. More recently, investigators have attempted to titrate precisely the dose of antineoplastic agents based on previously derived models and real-time analysis of plasma drug or tissue concentrations. Studies have been completed or are in progress using hexamethylene bisacetamide, etoposide, teniposide, fluorouracil (FUra), and cytarabine (ara-C). Future studies will focus on optimal sampling strategies, analysis of intermediate biochemical end points, combination chemotherapy, modulation by colony-stimulating factors, and more sophisticated pharmacodynamic models.

"Delayed presentation of intrapericardial diaphragmatic hernia, an unusual cause of colon obstruction. The earliest symptoms of diaphragmatic hernia may not appear until viscera incarcerate in it years after the causal injury. The most unusual site for a diaphragmatic hernia to occur is through the central tendon of the diaphragm into the pericardium. We present the case of a 43-year-old man who suffered a bowel obstruction when the transverse colon and omentum became incarcerated in the intrapericardial diaphragmatic hernia. The defect presumably resulted from blunt chest and abdominal trauma received 15 years earlier. The delayed presentation of intrapericardial diaphragmatic hernia is reviewed, and recommendations for evaluation and treatment are made. ",0
"Polyneuropathy, ophthalmoplegia, leukoencephalopathy, and intestinal pseudo-obstruction: POLIP syndrome. We describe 5 individuals (from three separate families) with a progressive neurological disorder characterized by sensorimotor peripheral polyneuropathy, cranial neuropathies (external ophthalmoplegia, deafness), and the syndrome of chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Magnetic resonance imaging showed widespread abnormality of the cerebral and cerebellar white matter in the 2 patients studied. Autopsy examination in 3 revealed widespread endoneurial fibrosis and demyelination in the peripheral nervous system, possibly secondary to axonal atrophy, and poorly defined changes in cerebral white matter (leukoencephalopathy). The cranial nerves and spinal roots were less severely involved and the neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord were intact. The fatal gastrointestinal dysmotility was due to a severe visceral neuropathy. We suggest that these patients manifested a hereditary disorder with distinctive clinical, radiological, and neuropathological features, and propose the acronym POLIP to emphasize the distinctive tetrad of polyneuropathy, ophthalmoplegia, leukoencephalopathy, and intestinal pseudo-obstruction.

"A case of classical mycosis fungoides associated with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I. A 72-year-old male patient from north-eastern Iran developed the typical clinical and histopathological features of mycosis fungoides with lymphadenopathy, but without any other systemic involvement. Human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-I) antibodies were detected in the patient's serum by two different ELISAs and by Western blot using purified viral particles from MT-2 culture supernatants. Cultured peripheral blood lymphocytes were positive for labelling with anti-HTLV-I serum. Southern blot hybridization of DNA extracted from a skin tumour and from an involved lymph node revealed integrated proviral DNA with identical restriction patterns. This case supports a relationship between mycosis fungoides and HTLV-I and may indicate a new region of endemic HTLV-I infection. ",0
"Indigenous cases of Lyme disease diagnosed in North Carolina. Between January 1984 and December 1989, 102 indigenous cases of Lyme disease were reported in North Carolina. Lyme disease was reported in each of the three major geographic regions of the state: mountain, piedmont, and coastal plain. One or more diagnoses were made in 42 of 100 counties. Patients ranged in age from 5 months to 78 years (median, 27 years); 58 patients (57%) reported a history of tick exposure within 1 month of the onset of symptoms. Erythema migrans was reported by 93 patients (91%). Arthritis (30%), neurologic symptoms (10%), and cardiac abnormalities (7%) were observed. Thirty of the 102 cases were confirmed serologically by indirect fluorescence microscopy or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. ",0
"Photosensitive epilepsies and photoconvulsive responses in Arabs. The occurrence of photosensitivity (PS) was examined in 327 Arabs greater than or equal to 15 years of age with epilepsy by intermittent photic stimulation (IPS). A control group of 192 nonepileptic Arabs greater than or equal to 15 years of age were also examined by IPS. Of the epileptic patients, 24 (7.3%) were photosensitive, an incidence comparable to that in whites in contradistinction to the reported rarity among African blacks. This finding indicates that environmental factors, particularly excessive sunshine, does not appear to influence the occurrence of PS among epileptic patients. The occurrence of PS among epileptic patients may depend more strongly on the presence of an epileptic syndrome known to have association with PS. ",0
"Embryo reduction in multifetal pregnancies after infertility therapy: obstetrical risks and perinatal benefits are related to operative strategy. To assess the benefits that can be expected from embryo reduction of multiple pregnancies after infertility therapy, we report 58 consecutive cases of selective termination using either a transcervical or a transabdominal approach. The initial number of embryos was five or more in 13 patients, four in 29 patients, and three in 15 patients. The miscarriage rate after transabdominal procedures (23%) was one half of that after transcervical aspiration. Forty pregnancies resulted in the live birth of one child or more. The rate of prematurity was strongly related to the number of embryos left. Mean gestational age at birth was 35.5 weeks but reached 37.7 weeks when only one embryo was left. A reduction in premature birth after selective termination appeared clear for pregnancies with four or more embryos but was less significant for triplets. ",0
"Management decisions in laryngeal carcinoma in situ. Twenty-one patients with laryngeal carcinoma in situ (n = 12) or carcinoma in situ with microinvasion (n = 9) were treated with laser mucosal dissection of the vocal cords and/or superficial laser cordectomy. The normal architecture of the vocal cords was preserved because the depth of vaporization was usually superficial in these early cases. Five patients had recurrence, new tumor, or persistence of abnormal tissue that required additional laser surgical treatments. With a follow-up range of 6 months to 4 years, all patients currently are free of laryngeal abnormality, and no patient has needed open laryngeal surgery or radiation therapy. Transoral endoscopic laser resection of laryngeal carcinoma in situ with or without microinvasion should be the treatment of choice for these early lesions. ",0
"Third ventricle cavernous angioma: report of two cases. Cavernous angioma arising in the third ventricle is an extremely rare disease. We have reviewed five cases previously reported, as well as our own two cases, and discuss the clinical characteristics of and surgical approach to cavernous angioma at this site. The bifrontal craniotomy and interhemispheric translamina terminalis approach minimize the damage to the brain and allow for an approach to the third ventricle in a wide operative field with minimal compression of the brain itself. We have found this approach to be suitable for surgery on angiomas of the anterior half of the third ventricle. ",0
"Psychological characteristics of children with Shwachman syndrome. Twelve children and young adults with Shwachman syndrome were compared with their unaffected siblings and with controls suffering from cystic fibrosis in terms of intellectual ability, motor skills, and behaviour. There were highly significant differences in intelligence quotient between those with Shwachman syndrome and the other two groups. Four of the index subjects but none of the control subjects were below the normal range. The differences between groups on other tests of cognitive and motor skills were not significant, though those with Shwachman syndrome tended to have the lowest scores. There was no evidence that those with Shwachman syndrome had more behavioural difficulties than the control subjects. We suggest that the intellectual difficulties of patients with Shwachman syndrome may be of neurological rather than social origin and that they may originate before birth. ",0
"Murine erythroleukemia cell line GM979 contains factors that can activate silent chromosomal human gamma-globin genes. We introduced a normal chromosome 11 into GM979 murine erythroleukemia cells by fusing them with Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphocytes from a normal individual. In contrast to previous data obtained with other murine erythroleukemia cells, we detected activation of human chromosomal gamma-globin genes in GM979 cells. GM979, unlike previously used murine erythroleukemia cell lines, expresses murine embryonic globin in addition to adult globin. While all the hybrids expressed gamma- and beta-globin, they displayed a wide range of gamma-globin expression in relation to that of beta-globin. No correlation, however, was found in quantitative expression between murine embryonic globin and human gamma-globin in these hybrids, suggesting that the two globins are regulated independently, at least in this cell line. These data indicate that gamma-globin genes from normal, nonerythroid chromosomes are not irreversibly silenced, and they can be activated by a positive trans factor(s) present in GM979 cells. ",0
"Access to cancer prevention, detection, and treatment. The American Cancer Society Hearings on Cancer and the Poor made visible to the nation the harsh realities and consequences of lack of access to health care among the poor and uninsured in America. Access to care is more than mere availability; it is also financial accessibility, effectiveness, acceptability, appropriateness, and comprehensiveness of care. The problems and consequences of lack of health care access and its impact on the cancer problem among poor Americans are explored, and ways practitioners and public advocates can improve access are suggested. Local communities have risen to action to make health care more accessible. Successful programs have done their research to document access problems; then they have taken their findings to county governments to request additional funding and to health care institutions to request institutional policy and service changes to make health care more available and accessible.

"Point mutation in the exoplasmic domain of the erythropoietin receptor resulting in hormone-independent activation and tumorigenicity. The receptors for erythropoietin and other cytokines constitute a new superfamily. They have no tyrosine-kinase or other enzyme motif and their signal-transducing mechanism is unclear. Here we describe two classes of activating mutations in the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR). A single point mutation in the exoplasmic domain enables it to induce hormone-independent cell growth and tumorigenesis after expression in nontumorigenic, interleukin-3-dependent haematopoietic cells. A C-terminal truncation in the cytoplasmic domain of the EPOR renders the receptor hyperresponsive to erythropoietin, but is insufficient to induce hormone-independent growth or tumorigenicity. The activating point mutation retards intracellular transport and turnover of the receptor. These alterations in metabolism and tumorigenicity caused by the EPOR with activating point mutations are similar to those observed in erythropoietin-independent activation of the wild type EPOR by association with gp55, the Friend spleen focus-forming virus glycoprotein.

"How selective is selective posterior rhizotomy? Although selective posterior rhizotomy has become an increasingly utilized surgical treatment for spasticity, the procedure is unstandardized and is performed differently at various medical centers. Most surgeons use some form of direct dorsal rootlet stimulation with intraoperative multichannel electromyographic response monitoring. Electrophysiological monitoring offers the theoretical advantage of identifying pathologic reflex circuits for interruption while preserving those pathways that are ""normal."" However, the monitoring technique most commonly used has not been critically evaluated and, therefore, its value remains uncertain. In 22 selective posterior rhizotomy procedures performed for spastic cerebral palsy, the authors were unable to identify a single electromyographic response that could be called normal by presently accepted criteria. Dorsal rootlets were chosen for division on the basis of relative degrees of abnormality. Intraoperative electromyographic monitoring of a nonspastic patient produced tracings suggestive of spasticity by presently accepted criteria. These discrepancies suggest that current electrophysiological monitoring in selective posterior rhizotomy should be reevaluated. ",0
"An objective score to predict upper tract deterioration in myelodysplasia. Bladder dysfunction in myelodysplasia may present a significant hazard to the upper tract and a threat to kidney function. Urodynamic features of high leak pressure and detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia have been associated with an increased risk. We have developed an objective score to describe urodynamic findings in myelodysplasia. The score includes consideration of bladder compliance, detrusor contractility and reflux, in addition to leak pressure and sphincter behavior. In 171 myelodysplastic patients a significant correlation was demonstrated between the score and upper tract studies at the time of urodynamics and the score and the management decision. Of 73 myelodysplasia patients with normal upper tracts at the first urodynamics study hydronephrosis later developed in 14. The score was a potent predictor of outcome (p = 0.0006). ",0
"Cerebrospinal fluid eicosanoid levels: endogenous PGD2 and LTC4 synthesis by antigen-presenting cells that migrate to the central nervous system. We analyzed CSF from patients with multiple sclerosis, patients with other neurologic diseases, and healthy controls for the presence of prostaglandin (PG) E2, F2 alpha, D2, I, A, and leukotriene (LT) C4. Control CSF had little measurable PGs or LTs. CSF eicosanoids from patients with progressive MS were increased. We found PGD2 only in MS CSF. CSF monocytes from patients in active disease produced significantly increased PGD, PGE, and LTC4 than paired peripheral blood monocytes and monocytes from healthy controls. We saw no significant difference in LTC4 production between MS and control peripheral blood monocytes. ",0
"Primary malignant melanoma of the lower respiratory tract. Report of a case and literature review. The authors report a case of primary bronchial malignant melanoma, occurring in a 34-year-old woman presenting with persistent cough. At bronchoscopic examination, a polypoid mass was found to occlude the left mainstem bronchus. Biopsies showed a malignant epithelioid tumor resembling an atypical carcinoid. Histochemistry, electron microscopic study, and immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis of melanoma. Physical examination and additional clinical history to exclude other possible primary sites were negative. The patient underwent thoracotomy with left pneumonectomy. Nineteen months after resection she was found to have a histologically similar tumor involving her left adrenal gland. Review of the literature shows that melanoma of the lower respiratory tract has been reported only in adults and has a tendency to present as a central polypoid growth that may be responsive to surgical resection.

"Solid and cystic ultimobranchial body remnants in the thyroid. In this study we determined the incidence rate (89%) and characterized the morphology of ultimobranchial body (UBB) remnants found in 18 serially sectioned neonatal thyroid glands. Although UBB remnants are often referred to as solid cell nests, we found cystic features in 55%. Ciliated columnar cells were seen in 23%. One contained a large pseudo-papilla. The UBB cells had nuclei with features reminiscent of papillary carcinoma nuclei in that they were enlarged, oval, and contained finely dispersed chromatin when compared with follicular cell nuclei. Both papillary carcinomas and UBB remnants are common, occur as tiny, solid, or cystic thyroid entities in patients of all ages, may contain papillary structures, and share some common nuclear features. Therefore, it is important to include UBB remnants in the differential diagnosis of minute thyroid entities and to recognize their morphologic features. ",0
"New active analogues of vitamin D with low calcemic activity. In conclusion, a number vitamin D analogues have been developed that have very low calcemic activity but retain several other properties of 1,25-(OH)2D3, including the ability to differentiate leukemia and skin cells, to enhance the immune response, and to suppress parathyroid hormone levels. Although the mechanism of this selective activity is not yet clear, these analogues may provide new insights into the differences in action of 1,25-(OH)2D3 in various target tissues. Most importantly, the selective action of these analogues may be exploited for the treatment of diseases such as leukemia, psoriasis and hyperparathyroidism. ",0

The pharmacokinetics and penetration into a cantharidine-induced inflammatory exudate of meropenem was studied in six volunteers following a single 1-g intravenous dose. Concentrations in plasma, urine, and the inflammatory exudate were determined by a microbiological assay. The mean elimination half-life of meropenem in plasma was 1.1 h, with the concentration in plasma declining from a mean of 23.6 micrograms/ml at 1 h to 0.7 micrograms/ml at 6 h. The inflammatory fluid penetration was rapid (time to maximum concentration of drug in serum, 0.75 h), and the penetration was 111%. The recovery of meropenem in urine at 24 h was 65.4% of the administered dose. ",0
"Granulomatous prostatitis and poorly differentiated prostate carcinoma. Their distinction with the use of immunohistochemical methods. Granulomatous prostatitis and poorly differentiated prostate carcinoma can mimic each other both clinically and histologically. To develop criteria useful in resolving problem cases, the authors compared the reactivities of these conditions (nine cases of granulomatous prostatitis and six cases of poorly differentiated carcinoma) with a panel of antibodies to cytokeratin (AE1/3), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), lysozyme, antimacrophage M, and leukocyte common antigen (LCA). In granulomatous prostatitis, histiocytes were not immunoreactive for PAP, PSA, or cytokeratin; however, histiocytes reacted to lysozyme in nine of nine cases, antimacrophage M in seven of nine cases, and LCA in one of nine cases. Tumor cells from all six carcinoma cases reacted with PAP, PSA, and cytokeratin; all failed to react with lysozyme, LCA, and antimacrophage M. The authors conclude that granulomatous prostatitis and poorly differentiated carcinoma can be reliably distinguished with immunohistochemical methods. ",0
"Multiple gunshot wounds of the head: an anthropological view. A decomposed body was judged at the scene to have two gunshot wounds of the thorax and three of the head. Confirmed at autopsy, the condition of the remains precluded conclusions about the precise nature of the defects. Preparation and reconstruction of the skull disclosed seven large cranial defects and a series of fractures. This preparation allowed the application of well-known principles of gunshot wound analysis. Although the analysis of specific gunshot wound defects is well covered in the literature, there are few examples of the application of gunshot wound principles to complex wound cases. Three entrances and three exits were identified. A seventh defect resulted from bullet passage. Finally, the wounds were sequenced. ",0
"Epidemiology of acute respiratory infections in young children from Thailand. A prospective evaluation of the epidemiology and presentations of acute respiratory infections in children younger than 5 years of age admitted to Children's Hospital Bangkok (1988 to 1989) was supported by the World Health Organization. There were 226 patients with the inclusion criteria: 1 to 5 years of age; duration of illness less than 2 weeks; no prior antibiotic therapy; and low socioeconomic status. The disease categories included: croup, 19 cases; bronchiolitis, 60 cases; and pneumonia, 147 cases. Pathogens isolated were: respiratory syncytial virus (40); parainfluenza III (1); influenza B (1); and adenovirus (1); bacterial infections were proved in 23 cases. No significant differences in clinical features between bacterial and viral pneumonia were found. Interstitial radiographic patterns were more common in viral pneumonia whereas alveolar patterns were more common in bacterial pneumonia. However, 91% of mixed radiographic patterns (interstitial and alveolar) in chest films were from viral pneumonia. ",0
"Arterial responses during migraine headache. The superficial temporal artery has been thought to be the main focus of pain during migraine attacks, but its diameter has never been measured directly. The use of a new, high-resolution ultrasound machine to measure arterial size in 25 migraine patients with unilateral head pain showed that the lumen was wider on the painful than on the non-painful side during a migraine attack. The diameters of both radial arteries and the temporal artery on the non-painful side were smaller during than between attacks. The generalised vasoconstriction was not shared by the temporal artery on the affected side, which suggests a local vasodilatory response. The findings suggest that cephalic arteries may play a role in migraine pathogenesis. ",0
"Expression of P-glycoprotein in adult T-cell leukemia cells. We have examined the expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) samples from 25 patients. Based on immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody against P-gp, C219, 8 of 20 ATL patients were P-gp positive at the initial presentation. All 6 patients at the relapsed stage were P-gp positive, and refractory to chemotherapy. The expression of MDR1 mRNA in P-gp-positive ATL cells was increased at the relapsed stage of one patient. P-gp of this patient was photolabeled with [3H]azidopine and the labeling was inhibited with nimodipine, vinblastine and progesterone. These results suggest that P-gp expressed in ATL cells from patients at relapsed stage has the same binding site(s) for the drugs as that in multidrug resistant cells, and is correlated with the refractory nature of the cells to chemotherapy.

"Effect of indomethacin on the pathophysiology of experimental meningitis in rabbits. The effects of indomethacin on central nervous system abnormalities in rabbits with experimental pneumococcal meningitis were studied. As expected, prostaglandin E2 levels in cerebrospinal fluid were significantly lower in the indomethacin-treated group, indicating that the drug effectively reduced prostaglandin synthesis. Brain edema was markedly attenuated in the indomethacin-treated group; however, cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell counts, lactate and protein concentrations, and intracisternal pressure were not significantly different between groups. It seems that indomethacin, while effective in reducing brain edema, does not significantly affect other important pathophysiologic alterations in experimental pneumococcal meningitis. ",0
"Anti-Kveim monoclonal antibody. New monoclonal antibody reacting to epithelioid cells in sarcoid granulomas. A monoclonal antibody to the sarcoid granulomagenic agent contained in Kveim suspension was prepared by immunizing mice with Kveim suspension. One monoclonal antibody (IHY-1) that reacted with the epithelioid cells in sarcoid granulomas on immunoperoxidase technique was selected. The immunoperoxidase technique was used to compare this monoclonal antibody's binding to sarcoidosis- or tuberculosis-affected lymph nodes. IHY-1 is a monoclonal antibody of IgM class. This antibody did not react to erythrocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, alveolar macrophages, or the macrophage-derived cell lines such as U-973 and KG-1. It reacted to granuloma epithelioid cells of sarcoidosis-affected lymph nodes. The monoclonal antibody also reacted positively to epithelioid cells in tuberculous granulomas although the reaction was not as strong. Since IHY-1 was found to bind to both types of granulomas, this suggests that the epithelioid cells in sarcoidosis have antigenicity common to the epithelioid cells in tuberculosis. ",0
"Speech, velopharyngeal function, and hearing before and after orthognathic surgery. Articulation, voice, resonance, hearing sensitivity, and middle ear function were examined in 34 patients before and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after orthognathic surgery. Thirty of the 34 patients had articulation errors before surgery. Errors on the sibilants /s/ and /z/ occurred most frequently, followed by those on /j,zh,ch/ and /sh/. Errors were predominantly distortions with both visual and acoustic components. After surgery, articulation improved spontaneously in the absence of intervention. Most of the preoperative articulation errors were eliminated by 3 months postoperative, but, thereafter, a gradual decline was noted so that by 12 months, errors occurred on /s/ and /z/. Voice, resonance, velopharyngeal port area, and hearing sensitivity were not altered by surgery. This study suggests that severe skeletal malocclusions requiring surgical correction have deleterious effects on the patients' articulation of consonants and that surgical alteration leads to the correction of most of these errors.

"Effect of hydrocele on testis and spermatogenesis. One hundred and twenty cases of big unilateral hydrocele of the tunica vaginalis testis have been studied to ascertain the effect on the structure and function of the testis, taking the normal side as control. There was no pressure effect from the hydrocele on the structure of the testis in 70 per cent, a flattening of testis in 22 per cent, and atrophy of testis in 8 per cent of cases. There was partial arrest of spermatogenesis in 10 per cent and total arrest of spermatogenesis in 8 per cent of cases. The remaining 82 per cent showed normal spermatogenesis. ",0
"Lymph node metastasis from papillary-follicular thyroid carcinoma in young patients. A total of 117 patients under 20 years of age with papillary and/or follicular thyroid cancer presented to the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1949 and 1987. The most common presenting symptom was a cervical mass. Twenty percent of the patients had a history of prior irradiation. Sixty percent initially had palpable lymph nodes, while 26% who had clinically negative examinations had pathologically positive lymph nodes. Recurrence was highest in regional lymph nodes at 24%, with only a 4% recurrence rate at the primary site and a 3% recurrence rate at distant sites. There were no deaths due to the thyroid cancer. To maintain a low rate of recurrence, near-total thyroidectomy with neck dissection followed by iodine 131 treatment should be considered in these young patients. ",0
"Urogenital dysfunction after abdominoperineal resection for carcinoma of the rectum. The long-term urogenital dysfunctions in 46 of 104 surviving patients submitted to abdominoperineal resection for rectal carcinoma between 1972 and 1986 were collected and assessed. Urinary retention was present in 41 percent of the men and 35 percent of women, while incontinence was present in 10 percent of men and 29 percent of women. Impotence was reported by 59 percent of the males, all sexually active before surgery. Dyspareunia was present in 50 percent of the women in the study. The possibility of treating prostatic hypertrophy concurrently with abdominoperineal resection in selected cases to avoid urinary retention is discussed. The limited number of responders to the survey may interfere with the global statistical significance. ",0
"A blood-liquid interface for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation with excellent antithrombogenicity. The authors verified the excellent antithrombogenicity of a blood-liquid interface (BLI) and introduced an oxygenator based on the principle of gas exchange across direct BLI. In a newly developed oxygenator, three layers of liquid flowed horizontally, contacting one another: O2 saturated silicone oil on the top, O2 saturated fluorcarbon at the bottom, and blood in the middle. Gas exchange was carried out across both direct BLIs. This system provided excellent antithrombogenicity as well as good gas exchange. The results indicate that this method will become a promising modality for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation. ",0
"A topographical relationship between Helicobacter pylori and gastritis: quantitative assessment of Helicobacter pylori in the gastric mucosa. A topographical relationship between the number of Helicobacter pylori in the gastric mucosa and the histological severity of gastritis was studied in 902 pairs of biopsy specimens taken from 314 patients. A pair of biopsies were taken from the antrum, the lesser curvature of the middle body, and the greater curvature of the upper body of the stomach. The quantitative assessment of H. pylori was made based on smear, culture, and tissue section. The histological severity of gastritis was assessed as to the degrees of mononuclear cell and polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration. A positive correlation was confirmed between the number of H. pylori and the severity of polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration. The degrees of inflammatory cells infiltration in the specimens with H. pylori colonization were significantly lower in the upper body than in the antrum. ",0
"Evaluation of argon laser surgery in children under 13 years of age. Argon laser surgery is an effective treatment for ectasias and congenital port-wine stains; however, its use in children under the age of 13 is controversial. This paper reviews 202 children under the age of 13 who underwent argon laser treatments for congenital port-wine stains, spider angiomas, epidermal nevi, and lentigines. The clinical characteristics of port-wine stains in 170 children are discussed. Good to excellent results (moderate to complete clearing) in port-wine stains were obtained in 60 percent of patients and seemed to correlate best with lack of blanchability on pressure. Hypertrophic scarring was seen in only 7 children, all of whom had undressed wounds; no significant scarring has been seen in any subsequent child who had maintained a dressed wound postoperatively.

"Portal vein resection with a new antithrombogenic catheter. Curative resection of pancreatic and hepatobiliary tumors is rarely possible because of local invasion, especially into the portal vein. We developed a new antithrombogenic catheter using a heparinized hydrophilic polymer to allow portal vein bypass during resection of tumors invading the portal vein. Pancreatectomy or hepatectomy accompanied by portal vein resection was performed for pancreatic or hepatobiliary cancer, with an intraoperative shunt from the superior mesenteric vein to the femoral vein or from the superior mesenteric vein to the intrahepatic portal vein through the umbilical vein or the hepatic hilar portal vein. Use of the shunt prevented stasis in the superior mesenteric vein and hepatic ischemia even during prolonged occlusion of the portal vein, and portal vein resection was performed in 81 patients with hepatobiliary and pancreatic disease with greater safety and ease.

"Pancreatic mucinous cystadenocarcinoma with pseudosarcomatous mural nodules. A report of a case with immunohistochemical study. A case of pancreatic mucinous cystadenocarcinoma (PMC) with two pseudosarcomatous mural nodules (PMN) is described. These nodules have not been previously described in this type of tumor. In ovarian mucinous tumors (OMT), similar nodules have been reported, the nature of which has been discussed in detail. Here the similarity between the tumor described here and ovarian tumors is stressed. The immunohistochemical study carried out disclosed in the nodules strong positive staining for vimentin and moderate positivity for keratin and epithelial membrane antigen. These findings, along with histologic details, favor the epithelial nature of the nodules. It was concluded that the nodules are foci of anaplastic carcinoma with high proliferative cell rate, which could explain the coexpression of vimentin and keratin. ",0
"Argon green (514 nm) versus krypton red (647 nm) modified grid laser photocoagulation for diffuse diabetic macular edema. Between 1984 and 1988, 225 eyes of 132 patients were entered in a prospective, randomized clinical trial to determine if any significant differences exist between treatment with argon green (514 nm) and krypton red (647 nm) modified grid laser photocoagulation for patients with diffuse diabetic maculopathy with or without cystoid macular edema. At the 12- and 24-month follow-up visits, no statistically significant difference was found between the two groups with respect to all of the following: reduction or elimination of macular edema, improvement in visual acuity, worsening of visual acuity, number of treatments per eye, and effect on the visual field. At the 12-month follow-up visit, none of the following factors statistically affected the visual outcome in either of the two groups: a history of systemic hypertension, systemic vascular disease, cystoid macular edema, or initial poor visual acuity.

"The febrile alcoholic in the emergency department. The authors retrospectively reviewed the charts of 31 alcoholic patients admitted with fever without a defined source. In our population 58% of patients were subsequently found to have an infectious cause for their fever. Pneumonia was the most common infection, but occult urinary tract infections were seen surprisingly often. Noninfectious but serious disorders, such as delirium tremens, prolonged postictal state, and subarachnoid hemorrhage, were also common. Infectious and noninfectious causes commonly coexisted. The most common noninfectious cause was alcohol withdrawal, with or without seizures. The authors believe that indigent, malnourished, chronic alcoholics with fever for which a source cannot be readily identified, should usually be admitted to the hospital for observation and to await culture results.

"Effect of felbamate on plasma levels of carbamazepine and its metabolites. Felbamate (FBM) is a novel antiepileptic drug (AED) currently undergoing clinical evaluation in the United States. During a controlled clinical trial conducted at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, FBM was added to constant carbamazepine (CBZ) monotherapy. CBZ total concentrations were reduced during active FBM treatment (mean reduction 25%, range 10-42%, p less than 0.001). The effect was evident after the first week of treatment and reached a plateau in 2-4 weeks. To clarify the interaction mechanism, free and total concentrations of CBZ and its plasma metabolites were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ultrafiltration in four patients. In these patients, FBM treatment reduced CBZ concentrations and increased CBZ-epoxide (CBZ-E) concentrations (p less than 0.01). Free fractions of all compounds were unmodified. FBM appears to be capable of inducing CBZ metabolism. CBZ-FBM interaction may be clinically relevant. ",0
"Cortical tremor: a variant of cortical reflex myoclonus. Two patients with action tremor that was thought to originate in the cerebral cortex showed fine shivering-like finger twitching provoked mainly by action and posture. Surface EMG showed relatively rhythmic discharge at a rate of about 9 Hz, which resembled essential tremor. However, electrophysiologic studies revealed giant somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) with enhanced long-loop reflex and premovement cortical spike by the jerk-locked averaging method. Treatment with beta-blocker showed no effect, but anticonvulsants such as clonazepam, valproate, and primidone were effective to suppress the tremor and the amplitude of SEPs. We call this involuntary movement ""cortical tremor,"" which is in fact a variant of cortical reflex myoclonus. ",0
"Angioedema from angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors: a cause of upper airway obstruction. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have several side effects of concern to the otolaryngologist. Angioedema is a rare, but potentially lethal adverse effect when associated with upper airway obstruction. Four cases of ACE-inhibitor-induced angioedema, three with significant upper airway obstruction, are reported. Angioedema secondary to ACE inhibition appears to be mechanism based. The probable link is the potentiation of bradykinin, which results in vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and angioedema. Since angioedema can progress to upper airway obstruction, otolaryngologists must be aware of this association. The differential diagnosis and treatment of this adverse effect is discussed, as well as a review of ACE inhibitors and other causes of angioedema. ",0
"Transbronchial biopsies in children after heart-lung transplantation. Sixty transbronchial biopsies have been performed in eight children after heart-lung transplantation. The selection of fiber-optic bronchoscope or a small (4 mm; 30 cm) rigid bronchoscope was made according to the size of endotracheal tube required at surgery. If the endotracheal tube was size 7.5 or greater, a fiber-optic bronchoscope was used, whereas if the endotracheal tube size was below 7, a rigid bronchoscope was used. For the diagnosis of lung rejection, the histology of biopsies revealed a sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 69% (similar to the result in adults). The histology also distinguished lung infection from rejection. Complications included three pneumothoraces and two clinically significant episodes of hemorrhage, one of which led to a cardiorespiratory arrest, which may have been caused by hypoxia. As a result, arterial oxygen saturation is now monitored during the procedure using a pulse oximeter. ",0
"Optimal interpretation of the supine exercise electrocardiogram in patients with right bundle branch block. A detailed analysis of the exercise ECG was performed in 82 patients with right bundle branch block who underwent supine exercise equilibrium radionuclide angiography. The sensitivity and specificity of each individual electrocardiographic lead for the detection of a positive radionuclide angiogram was determined. Leads V5 and V6 had a sensitivity of 58 percent and a specificity of 89 percent. The limb leads and lead V4 had a lower sensitivity, but an equivalent specificity. Leads V1 and V3 each had a clearly lower specificity that ranged from 56 to 67 percent. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that the optimal interpretation of the exercise ECG included the limb leads and V4 to V6, but not V1 to V3. The results of coronary angiography in the subset of 16 patients who underwent this procedure confirmed these findings. ",0
"Use of a knee-brace for control of tibial translation and rotation. A comparison, in cadavera, of available models. We assessed the relative restraints that are provided by fourteen currently available functional knee-braces, using six limbs in cadavera. The tests were made at 30 and 60 degrees of flexion of the knee, and a mechanical loading system applied loads that caused anterior-posterior translation and internal-external rotation. The braces limited abnormal tibiofemoral displacements by 10 to 75 per cent in translation; there was more variation in rotation. This study demonstrated that functional knee-braces provide a restraining influence that may be beneficial in the control of abnormal displacements of the knee, but that the degree of restraint varies considerably.

"Limitation of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization using iodized oil for small hepatocellular carcinoma. A study in resected cases. The radiologic and histologic findings are presented of the resection of 14 small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC), less than 2 cm in maximum diameter, after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TCE) using iodized oil. The effect of TCE on small HCC depended on the morphologic type of the tumors. When no extracapsular invasion of tumor cells occurred, TCE was extremely effective against encapsulated tumors. However, in nine of the 14 resected specimens, viable tumor cells remained in or around the tumor. The authors suggest that small HCC are not always curable with TCE alone and that a multi-disciplinary approach is necessary for patients with small HCC. ",0
Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction presenting as ascites: the importance of clinically assessing central venous pressure. A 66-year-old man without history of heart disease or symptoms of left ventricular (LV) failure was admitted with transudative ascites. Echocardiography showed no valvular or pericardial disease and normal LV function. Gated pool scintigraphy confirmed normal LV systolic function but demonstrated severe right ventricular systolic dysfunction. Catheterization revealed left ventricular diastolic dysfunction as the cause of right-sided failure. The clinician evaluating transudative ascites cannot exclude LV failure on the basis of noninvasive assessment of systolic function alone. Appreciation of an elevated central venous pressure remains the most important evidence of a cardiac source of ascites. ,0
"Cutaneous manifestations of multiple myeloma. We report the cutaneous manifestations of multiple myeloma, using a retrospective review of 115 patients' records obtained from tumor registry files. Five patients were found to have biopsy-proved extramedullary plasmacytomas without extension from an underlying bony focus. Twelve patients had ecchymoses without thrombocytopenia; two of them had biopsy-proved amyloidosis. One patient presented with pyoderma gangrenosum and was subsequently diagnosed with multiple myeloma. The last patient initially presented with what clinically appeared to be leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and, in the course of a standard workup, he was diagnosed with multiple myeloma. These findings are discussed with regard to the current literature on the cutaneous manifestations of multiple myeloma. ",0
"Dietary management of acute childhood diarrhea: optimal timing of feeding and appropriate use of milks and mixed diets. Several recent clinical trials have examined the optimal timing of feeding and the appropriate foods for use in the dietary management of acute childhood diarrhea. Important methodologic issues relevant to these trials, such as the composition and masking of study diets, measurement of outcome variables, and assessment of nutritional status, are discussed. Available data suggest that feeding should be continued during diarrhea, although a small subgroup of patients receiving nonhuman milk exclusively may have an excess rate of complications. These children should be closely supervised or provided with alternative diets. By contrast, children receiving human milk, nonmilk formulas, and mixed diets are generally able to tolerate these foods and to benefit nutritionally from continued feeding. ",0
"Autoimmune enteropathy and colitis: is there a generalised autoimmune gut disorder? Children with protracted diarrhoea, circulating enterocyte autoantibodies, and an enteropathy showing features of inappropriate HLA molecule expression on the jejunal crypt epithelium, often present with persistent blood and mucus in their stools. Eight children with autoimmune enteropathy were investigated for the presence of associated colonic disease. Six children with protracted diarrhoea, no circulating autoantibodies, and an enteropathy (in five of them) undergoing colonoscopy were used as control subjects. In all eight patients, but not in the control subjects, there was macroscopic and microscopic evidence of an accompanying colitis of variable severity, thus indicating that a more generalised intestinal disorder was present, which might affect the whole intestine. Aberrant expression of DR molecules on the colonic surface and crypt epithelium was also detected. Autoimmunity may play a role in the colitis. ",0
"Renal effects of cyclosporine. Renal dysfunction is a frequent consequence of cyclosporine administration, even when cyclosporine blood concentrations are maintained within proper therapeutic levels. As dermatologic indications for this compound expand, it is important for clinicians to understand the relevant pharmacology and physiology that underlie cyclosporine-induced renal dysfunction. This article reviews the clinical pharmacology of cyclosporine, the principles of renal function testing, and the clinical manifestations of this drug's effects on the kidney. Sudden declines in kidney function, long-term cyclosporine nephrotoxicity, hemolytic-uremic syndrome, and hypertension are discussed from a clinical and experimental standpoint. Finally, practical suggestions are provided to aid the dermatologist in managing cyclosporine-treated patients. ",0
"Indications of the carbon dioxide laser in tracheobronchial pathology of the infant and young child: 14 cases. Fourteen children aged between 6 months and 7 years (mean age = 3.5 years) were treated by CO2 broncholaser in the ENT Department of Trousseau Hospital. Three groups of diagnostic indication were identified: 1. Granulomas treated after mucosal trauma (tracheotomy, foreign body). 2. Granulomas due to pulmonary and/or lymph node tuberculosis. 3. Adhesions and stenosis secondary to neonatal ventilation. The operative and anesthetic technique is described in detail, together with any possible adverse events. The CO2 broncholaser appears to be a technique of choice in this age group, in which the narrowness of the airways makes any endoscopic procedure difficult. The broncholaser allows the early treatment of obstructive tracheobronchial pathology with its risks of severe ventilatory sequelae. ",0
"Ciliary motility in two patients with yellow nail syndrome and recurrent sinopulmonary infections. The yellow nail syndrome (YNS) is described as a combination of yellow nails, chronic lymphedema, pleural effusions, and recurrent sinopulmonary infections, but all these features need not be present for the diagnosis. The mechanism that renders patients with this syndrome susceptible to respiratory infections is not known. To determine whether abnormal ciliary motility is a predisposing factor, in vitro ciliary beat frequency (CBF) was measured in two patients with YNS and recurrent respiratory infections. In each case, the CBF was within normal limits (12 Hz). These data suggest that abnormal ciliary motility is not a pathophysiologic mechanism of recurrent sinopulmonary infections in YNS. ",0
"Interaction of sodium sensitivity and stress in young adults. The interaction of sodium sensitivity and stress-induced cardiovascular reactivity was studied in white and black young adults aged 18-23 years. The cardiovascular response to difficult mental arithmetic was measured before and after 14 days of oral sodium loading (10 g NaCl/day added to the usual diet). A sodium-sensitive blood pressure response occurred in 18.4% of whites and 37.3% of blacks. A significant correlation between blood pressure change and sodium excretion occurred in the sodium-sensitive group (r = - 0.28, p less than 0.01). High sodium intake did not augment blood pressure or heart rate response to the beta-adrenergic-mediated stimulus of mental arithmetic in the population, which was grouped by blood pressure, race, or sodium sensitivity.

"Familial trigeminal neuralgia and Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy. Report of two families and review. Typical trigeminal neuralgia has occasionally occurred in multiple members of the same family over several generations. The clinical features of such cases, including the increased incidence in females, and the absence of other apparent hereditary, neurologic, metabolic, or structural abnormalities were identical to those of sporadic cases. More rarely, familial trigeminal neuralgia has been described in the setting of hereditary peripheral neuropathy, especially Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. We describe patients from two different families with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and medically intractable trigeminal neuralgia. Both patients were successfully treated by percutaneous retrogasserian glycerol rhizolysis. The occurrence of cranial nerve symptoms in patients with demyelinating peripheral neuropathies is discussed in light of the current hypotheses regarding the etiology of trigeminal neuralgia. ",0
"Clinical significance of intratesticular arterial anatomy. Testicular atrophy has been reported in 2 to 18% of the patients following orchiopexy for cryptorchidism. A possible cause of this atrophy is interference with the testicular blood supply by placement of a testicular traction suture through the tunica albuginea. Arterial casts of 32 adult human testes were created following placement of a 3-zero silk traction suture through the lower pole of the testis to determine the effects of this suture upon intragonadal arterial circulation. Significant arterial blockage, manifested as failure of the parenchymal branches to fill, was observed in 14% of the casts produced via injection through the internal spermatic artery and in 100% of the casts produced via injection through the deferential artery. The results of this study support discontinuing the routine use of parenchymal testicular traction sutures during orchiopexy. ",0
"Impact of active immunisation against enteritis necroticans in Papua New Guinea. Enteritis necroticans, known locally as pigbel, has been a major cause of illness and death among children in the highlands of Papua New Guinea. After a successful trial of active immunisation against the beta toxin of the causative organism, Clostridium perfringens type C, immunisation of children was begun in 1980. The effects of the immunisation programme on pigbel admissions in 3 of the 5 major highland hospitals were assessed. In each of the centres studied the proportion of admissions due to enteritis necroticans dropped significantly after immunisation was introduced (p less than 0.001) and hospital admissions for pigbel in 1984-86, when immunisation was well established, were less than one fifth of previous figures.

"Increased MEPP frequency as an early sign of experimental immune-mediated motoneuron disease. Intracellular recordings of miniature end-plate potentials were performed in extensor digitorum longus muscles from guinea pigs with experimental immune-mediated motoneuron destruction. In the early stages of the disease, the miniature end-plate potential frequency was elevated compared to that in control and normal animals. The amplitude and time course of the miniature end-plate potentials as well as the resting potential of the muscle fibers were not altered, which implies integrity of the postjunctional membrane. The increase in frequency of miniature end-plate potential reflects an increase of basal acetylcholine release and documents dysfunction of the presynaptic terminal of the neuromuscular junction. The increased frequency was associated with high levels of antimotoneuronal IgG in the blood and the presence of IgG at motor end-plates. These data suggest that the presynaptic terminal of the neuromuscular junction may be involved in the immune attack in animal models of motoneuron degeneration. ",0
"Definitive mandibular replacement using reconstruction plates. Mandibular defects following radical cancer surgery continue to provide challenges to head and neck surgeons. Twenty-seven patients with advanced oral cancer underwent primary mandibular replacement with metal reconstruction plates without the use of bone. Twenty-one patients (78%) had successful reconstruction with primary soft tissue healing. Six patients required removal of the plate in the postoperative period. Two of these patients had their reconstruction plates replaced as a secondary procedure following soft tissue healing. Thus, 23 of 27 patients (85%) had final mandibular reconstruction and were followed for an average of 19 months. Functional and cosmetic results were satisfactory. For patients with advanced disease, this technique compares favorably with microvascular transfer in terms of operating time and donor defect. Despite problems with plate exposure, the initial and overall success rates of 78% and 85%, respectively, make the use of these plates a reasonable choice for immediate reconstructive needs in patients with difficult tumors.

"Auras and subclinical seizures: characteristics and prognostic significance. The characteristics and prognostic significance of subclinical seizures and independent auras were studied in 40 patients with partial epilepsy who had long-term electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring with intracranial electrodes. Focal, restricted subclinical seizures were noted in 23 patients, and 11 patients experienced auras that were accompanied by ictal EEG discharges. Auras and subclinical seizures usually were identical in EEG appearance, but were distributed differently among patients. The subclinical seizures and auras usually had the same origin as complex partial seizures, but did not always reliably indicate complex partial seizure origin. Subclinical seizures and auras were of favorable prognostic significance for patients undergoing temporal lobectomy. A majority (greater than 80%) of individuals with subclinical seizures and auras were free of complex partial seizures after surgery, whereas a minority (29%) of patients without subclinical seizures and auras became free of complex partial seizures.

"Auditory-evoked responses in benign intracranial hypertension syndrome. In this study, auditory brainstem-evoked responses were conducted on 28 patients with otologic symptoms (pulsatile tinnitus, hearing loss, aural fullness) secondary to benign intracranial hypertension syndrome. Abnormalities consisting mainly of prolonged interpeak latencies were detected in one third of these patients. It is speculated that the pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for these auditory brainstem-evoked abnormalities are stretching-compression of the cochlear nerve and brainstem caused by the intracranial hypertension and/or primary edema of the same structures due to the benign intracranial hypertension syndrome itself. Normalization or improvement was noticed in the majority of the patients after management. Since the number of patients in this study is small, it is felt that the diagnostic and prognostic value of this test needs further evaluation. ",0
"Results of treatment of displaced patellar fractures by partial patellectomy. The results of partial patellectomy as a treatment for displaced patellar fractures were assessed retrospectively with use of clinical, radiographic, and isokinetic strength-testing criteria. Forty patients who had been followed for an average of 8.4 years were studied. In the extremity that had been operated on, the mean active range of motion was 94 per cent, the circumference of the thigh was 100 per cent, and the strength of the quadriceps was 85 per cent of these measurements in the contralateral extremity. The over-all result was rated as excellent in twenty patients, good in eleven, fair in six, and poor in three. There was a significant statistical correlation between the type of fracture and the outcome. The results of this study indicate that partial patellectomy can be an effective treatment for selected patellar fractures. ",0
"Prolonged confusion following convulsions due to generalized nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Among patients with a prolonged confusional state after convulsive seizure, we diagnosed 8 cases as generalized nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Six had a history of seizures, and 2 had new onset. The convulsive seizures were generalized in 6 and focal in two. The postictal confusion lasted up to 36 hours in the most prolonged case, and a delayed response to anticonvulsant medications occurred in all cases. The clinical symptoms ranged from mild confusion to coma. Psychiatric manifestations or automatisms were rare. The presumed etiology was due to diverse causes, but a withdrawal state was the most common. EEG demonstrated continuous or nearly continuous generalized ictal discharges of variable morphology. These cases call attention to the fact that some prolonged confusional states following convulsive seizures are in fact due to persistent seizure activity that can be diagnosed by EEG. ",0
"Clinical and manometric aspects of diffuse esophageal spasm in a cohort of subjects evaluated for dysphagia and/or chest pain. Manometric criteria for diffuse esophageal spasm have recently been restated. In this study, a cohort of 358 subjects was evaluated in a gastrointestinal motility laboratory for dysphagia and/or chest pain. Applying the recently proposed criteria of Richter and Castell, 18 subjects (5%) were diagnosed as having DES. Dysphagia was the major complaint (89%), while 44% of patients complained of chest pain and 33% of both symptoms. All patients shared more than 30% simultaneous contractions after wet swallows interspersed with normal peristaltic sequences. Associated manometric findings were repetitive (greater than 3 peaks) contractions (67%), high-amplitude contractions (33%), spontaneous activity (22%), prolonged duration (11%), and lower esophageal sphincter abnormalities (5%). Radiology disclosed significant abnormalities in only 27% of DES patients. ",0
"Portal vein resection with a new antithrombogenic catheter. Curative resection of pancreatic and hepatobiliary tumors is rarely possible because of local invasion, especially into the portal vein. We developed a new antithrombogenic catheter using a heparinized hydrophilic polymer to allow portal vein bypass during resection of tumors invading the portal vein. Pancreatectomy or hepatectomy accompanied by portal vein resection was performed for pancreatic or hepatobiliary cancer, with an intraoperative shunt from the superior mesenteric vein to the femoral vein or from the superior mesenteric vein to the intrahepatic portal vein through the umbilical vein or the hepatic hilar portal vein. Use of the shunt prevented stasis in the superior mesenteric vein and hepatic ischemia even during prolonged occlusion of the portal vein, and portal vein resection was performed in 81 patients with hepatobiliary and pancreatic disease with greater safety and ease.

"T cell subsets (Tc, Th, Ts, Tsi) and IL2 receptor-bearing cells in peripheral blood of patients in the acute phase of alcoholic hepatitis. The present study was designed to evaluate the proportion of T cell subsets and IL2 receptor positive cells in the peripheral blood of patients with acute alcoholic hepatitis (AAH) using monoclonal antibodies to T cell antigens and Tac in a double immunofluorescent technique. The results indicate that the percentage of the total T cells and the intensity of all the T cell antigens are significantly reduced and the percentage of T helper cells and the ratio between Th/Ts cells are significantly increased in AAH when compared to healthy controls. But, significant differences in values observed in this study were not found for the absolute number of these cells. These altered values returned to normal levels during convalescence. ",0
"Biology of basal cell carcinoma (Part I). Basal cell carcinoma is the most common malignancy in humans. Although rarely metastatic, it is capable of significant local destruction and disfigurement. This two-part article reviews the current understanding of basal cell carcinoma biology. Part I examines significant clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural features that relate to invasive potential. Genetic characteristics, including tumor growth rate, chromosomal abnormalities, and oncogene presence, are discussed, and expression of important cell and matrix proteins, including keratin, fibronectin, and HLA antigens, are reviewed. Further topics to be explored in Part II include host immunologic responses, theories of pathogenesis, and valuable second-line therapeutic regimens for treatment of multiple cancers. ",0
"Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging in Leigh disease. An infant with Leigh disease, who was the younger sister of a similarly affected infant, had been examined before the onset of the disease. Ultrasonography revealed hyperechoic lesions in the putamen and caudate nucleus during the preclinical stage. At onset, these changes extended into the cerebral cortex and medulla. These lesions were also detected by T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as areas of increased signal intensity. Her brother demonstrated the same ultrasonographic results; cranial computed tomography disclosed low-density areas in the basal ganglia which were detected as hyperechoic lesions by ultrasonography. These findings suggest that ultrasonography is useful in detecting early intracranial lesions in Leigh disease. ",0
"Subtrochanteric fractures treated with interlocking nailing. In a prospective study of 31 subtrochanteric fractures treated with Grosse-Kempf interlocking nails with a followup period of at least 1 year, there was a 87.1% (27/31) union rate, and a union period of 4.2 +/- 1.8 months. Knee range of motion in 28 acute traumatic cases was on average 127.5 +/- 23.0 degrees. The significant complications included: nail breakage, 3.2% (1/31); nonunion without nail breakage, 9.7% (3/31); neglected femoral fracture with malunion, 3.2% (1/31). The interlocking nailing has the advantages of: a) closed method, b) weight-sharing principle, c) shortening prevention, d) non-rigid fixation. From the theoretical and clinical comparison among the various implants, we conclude that closed interlocking nailing is one of the better instruments for subtrochanteric fracture treatment, and moreover, the most reasonable of all. However, for the higher level subtrochanteric fractures, reconstruction-style locking nails should be chosen. ",0
"Isolated calf venous thrombosis: diagnosis with compression US. Compression ultrasound (US) is an excellent means of evaluating the femoral and popliteal veins but is generally regarded as inadequate for the diagnosis of calf vein thrombosis. This prospective study evaluated compression sonography of the calf veins in 45 symptomatic patients with normal femoral and popliteal veins. All patients underwent correlative venography. Compression US enabled identification of 15 of 17 patients with calf vein thrombosis (sensitivity, 88%). The two false-negative results were in patients with small isolated thrombi. Compression US results were true-negative in 26 of 27 patients with normal venograms (specificity, 96%). If these results can be duplicated by other investigators in larger series of patients, compression US will be an adequate screening modality for calf vein thrombosis. ",0
Life-threatening complications during anaesthesia in a patient with a ventriculo-atrial shunt and pulmonary hypertension [published erratum appears in Anaesthesia 1991 Mar;46(3):241] A 6-year-old patient with hydrocephalus who underwent revision of a ventriculo-atrial shunt is described. Anaesthesia was complicated by the occurrence of systemic hypertension and arterial hypoxaemia. The patient was subsequently found to have pulmonary hypertension secondary to recurrent pulmonary thromboembolism. The pathophysiological mechanisms for the patient's deterioration are discussed and the anaesthetic management of children with pulmonary hypertension is outlined. It is concluded that patients with a ventriculo-atrial shunt who present for surgery should be screened carefully for the presence of pulmonary hypertension. ,0
"Resting metabolic rate and energy balance in amenorrheic and eumenorrheic runners. This study investigated metabolic and nutritional factors in association with athletic menstrual dysfunction (AMD). Three groups of women were studied: amenorrheic runners (amenorrheic), eumenorrheic runners (eumenorrheic), and eumenorrheic sedentary controls (sedentary). Amenorrheic and eumenorrheic were similar in age, weight, percent body fat by hydrodensitometry, training pace and mileage, best 10 km race time, years running, and maximal oxygen consumption. When adjusted for body weight or for fat-free mass by analysis of covariance, RMR was significantly lower in amenorrheic than in eumenorrheic and sedentary. The daily caloric intakes of the groups did not differ significantly, but the amenorrheic scored significantly higher than the eumenorrheic and sedentary on a scale of aberrant eating patterns. Amenorrheic high mileage runners seem to have a less adequate diet than eumenorrheic runners but appear to maintain energy balance and stable weight through a reduction in RMR. ",0
"Periurethral colonic-type polyp simulating urethral caruncle. A case report. A 50-year-old, black woman presented with a 1-cm, polypoid lesion on the posterior edge of the urethral meatus that had the gross appearance of a urethral caruncle. The histologic features, however, revealed a superficially ulcerated lesion composed of colonic-type mucosal glands with focal regenerative atypia in response to inflammation. A similar histologic pattern is also found in so-called solitary rectal ulcer syndrome and inflammatory cloacogenic polyps arising in the anorectal area. Based upon an English-language literature review, this case appears to be the second reported one of an intestinal-type polyp in this location. The patient had no further problems after excisional biopsy. ",0
"Achieving pH control in the critically ill patient: the role of continuous infusion of H2-receptor antagonists. Stress-related gastric mucosal damage is a common occurrence in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Because of the significant morbidity and mortality associated with this mucosal damage, many ICU patients routinely receive prophylactic therapy, usually with histamine H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs). Gastric acid secretion occurs in a circadian pattern, with late afternoon and evening surges. H2RAs by continuous infusion may control this uneven pattern of secretion more effectively than H2RAs given by bolus injection. More studies are needed to identify the target ICU population for prophylactic treatment. ",0
"Fatal pulmonary venoocclusive disease secondary to a generalized venulopathy: a new syndrome presenting with facial swelling and pericardial tamponade. We describe a patient who developed fatal pulmonary artery hypertension secondary to diffuse venulitis. This otherwise healthy young woman first presented with generalized venulopathy, with chemosis, facial swelling, pleural effusions, and pericardial tamponade. The symptoms partially responded to steroid therapy, but over a 2-year course, a rapidly progressive and fatal venoocclusive disease developed. No other primary condition was diagnosed, and at autopsy, the patient had striking venulitis throughout, including the pulmonary bed. We believe that this is a unique case of pulmonary hypertension resulting from a generalized venulopathy. ",0
"Complications in hyperthermia treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Of 435 patients treated with local hyperthermia to the prostate 27 had 29 complications, for an over-all complication rate of 6.6%. Urinary tract infections (7 cases), hematuria (6), and epididymitis (2) accounted for roughly half of the complications and could be attributed to the insertion of a catheter rather than the treatment itself but this remains to be proved. Most of the complications occurred within the first 3 treatment sessions. Despite the complication, 9 patients continued and completed the treatment course. Mean age of the study group was 73 +/- 8.3 years. Given the age of these patients, high incidence of accompanying diseases and low rate of complications, local hyperthermia should be considered a viable low risk treatment option in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia.

"Leukemias of indeterminant lineage. Two biologically and clinically important forms of acute leukemia have been described. Evidence suggests that both undifferentiated acute leukemia and many types of hybrid leukemia arise from relatively fewer differentiated cells than do the more straightforward acute leukemias. Clinical correlations suggest that patients with these leukemias may have a poorer prognosis, although some findings may be associated with an improved prognosis. More data in which multiple techniques are applied to the same leukemic cells are clearly needed. Patients with certain types of hybrid leukemias may be suitable candidates for more aggressive forms of chemotherapy or, possibly, combinations of therapy directed at cells of both lineages. ",0
"Thyrotoxicosis induced by topical iodine application. We describe an elderly man who was admitted with congestive cardiac failure and found to have thyrotoxicosis. He did not have goiter, and he had normal radioiodine uptake in his neck. Serum iodine levels were elevated, explaining the lack of increase in radioiodine uptake in the thyroid gland. He had multiple pressure sores, which were treated with povidone-iodine (Betadine) soaks. Biochemical data were consistent with Graves' disease unmasked by topical iodine application. Povidone-iodine soaks are commonly used in decubitus ulcer care and warrant special attention in patients with preexisting thyroid disorders. We have reviewed the literature on this unusual complication. ",0
"Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with L-tryptophan ingestion. Analysis of four patients and implications for differential diagnosis and pathogenesis Four patients fulfilling the case definition for eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome are described, including one whose disease began in 1986. Each displayed a variety of symptoms: one suffered principally from myalgia and recovered spontaneously on discontinuation of L-tryptophan therapy; one exhibited progressive sclerodermiform skin changes, neuropathy, and myopathy; a third had prominent neuromuscular disease and sclerodermiform skin changes; and the fourth experienced profound weight loss, an axonal polyneuropathy, and perivascular lymphoid infiltrates simulating a lymphoma. Evidence of T-cell activation was present in peripheral blood and affected tissues during the clinically active progressive phase of disease. Among other manifestations pleural effusion, cutaneous vasculitis, joint contractures, and bloody diarrhea were observed. A history of L-tryptophan ingestion should be sought in patients with myalgia, fatigue, or the above outlined symptoms. ",0
"Growth velocity before sudden infant death. Weight velocities of 136 infants who died from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) were compared with those of 136 controls matched for sex, birth weight, and type of feeding. It was found that the SIDS infants gained weight more slowly overall and that the differences were significantly different for infants who were not breast fed in the last two weeks in which it was possible to estimate their growth velocity. Breast fed infants had more periods of growth below the 25th centile than expected. These differences are unlikely to be useful in the prediction of which babies are likely to die from SIDS as there are frequent episodes of poor growth in infants who do not die. ",0
"Palliation of malignant esophageal obstruction. Progressive dysphagia is common in patients with advanced esophageal carcinoma. Multiple nonsurgical techniques are available to provide palliation and improved nutrition. Simple dilatation is the oldest technique and newer methods may offer greater efficacy. Laser therapy now provides an excellent opportunity to treat obstructing tumors. Placement of an esophageal prosthesis may become particularly useful when dilatation must be performed too frequently or has become ineffective or in the patient with an esophageal-pulmonary fistula. Newer techniques including BICAP tumor probe, intracavitary radiotherapy, or absolute alcohol injection offer promise. This review discusses the advantages and disadvantages of these different palliative techniques for patients with the extremely poor prognosis associated with esophageal cancer. ",0
"How long can a coronary reperfusion catheter be placed in acute coronary occlusion following failed transluminal coronary angioplasty? A case report. A coronary reperfusion catheter (CRC) is designed to preserve antegrade coronary flow when abrupt coronary closure occurs during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Insertion of the catheter to an occluded coronary artery for a few hours has been reported to be effective for myocardial salvage: however, it is unknown how long the catheter can be kept in place without causing extension of myocardial ischemia. The authors experienced a case in which the CRC was kept in place for twenty-four hours for anticoagulant therapy of an occluded coronary artery following failure of PTCA. This case suggests that adequate anticoagulant therapy can prolong the period during which a CRC can be kept in place if emergency coronary bypass surgery cannot be performed immediately after failure of coronary angioplasty.

"Molecular and hematologic characterization of Scottish-Irish type (epsilon gamma delta beta)zero thalassemia. The DNA deletion associated with an example of (epsilon gamma delta beta)zero thalassemia (Scottish-Irish type) was characterized. The deletion is approximately 205 kb in length and involves the epsilon, G gamma, A gamma, delta, and beta globin genes. The breakpoint is located 263 bp 3' to exon 3 of the beta globin gene. An LI (KpnI) repeat element approximately 320 bp in size is found at the 3' end of the novel DNA sequence. Different clinical phenotypes for three heterozygous neonates suggest that the deletion alone does not predict severity of (epsilon gamma delta beta)zero thalassemia at this age. ",0
"Diagnostic significance of carcinoembryonic antigen in the differential diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma. The histologic and cytologic distinction of malignant mesothelioma from carcinomas metastatic to the pleura or peritoneum is often problematic. For this reason immunologic methods are being increasingly used as diagnostic adjuncts. This review summarizes 40 studies on the expression of carcinoembryonic antigen in mesotheliomas and in lung and other carcinomas involving the pleura or peritoneum. Carcinoembryonic antigen was identified immunohistochemically in 11% of mesotheliomas and in 84% of carcinomas examined and immunocytochemically (in serous effusions) in 4% and 58%, respectively. In serum and in pleural or ascitic fluid, significantly elevated levels of carcinoembryonic antigen are commonly associated with (lung) carcinomas but rarely with mesotheliomas. Thus, together with identification of the antigen in serum, pleural fluid, or ascitic fluid, immunohistochemical and immunocytochemical techniques for detecting carcinoembryonic antigen provide a valuable aid for distinguishing malignant mesothelioma from metastatic carcinomas.

"The anatomy and physiology of nerve injury. Nerves have a structure of considerable complexity with features of special relevance to nerve injury and nerve regeneration. These include variations in the cross-sectional areas devoted to fascicular and epineurial tissue, the fascicular redistribution and mixing of different branch fibers brought about by fascicular plexuses, and the numbers of nerve fibers representing individual branches. The elasticity and tensile strength of nerve trunks and their capacity to resist traction deformation reside in the fascicular tissue, while the epineurium provides a protective cushion against compression. The microstructure of nerve trunks provides the basis for a classification of nerve injuries into five degrees of severity with partial and mixed types--each with a clearly defined pathology and distinguishing clinical features. Following a transection injury, changes occur in the severed axons, endoneurial tubes, fasciculi, and nerve trunk. The type of injury and the nature of these changes determine the outcome of axon regeneration. ",0
"Combined laminoplasty and posterolateral fusion for spinal canal surgery in children and adolescents. Spinal deformities, especially kyphosis and instability, after laminectomy for tumors and other diseases, are major clinical problems. Since 1981, combined laminoplasty and posterolateral fusion for the prevention of postlaminectomy spinal deformities was performed on eight male and two female patients aged two to 26 years (average, 13.9 years). The follow-up period was from six months to seven years and three months (average, three years and five months). Two patients died six and ten months postoperatively because of brain metastases (astrocytoma) and lung metastases (neuroblastoma), respectively. Good alignment with no instability of the cervical or thoracic spine was obtained for all patients, including the two who died. Laminoplasty combined with posterolateral fusion was found to be very effective in preventing the development of spinal deformities after spinal canal surgery for spinal cord tumors or other diseases in children and adolescents.

"Bleeding ectatic vascular lesion involving the sigmoid colon, endoscopically indistinguishable from angiodysplasia, in an 8-yr-old boy. An 8-yr-old Japanese boy was hospitalized, complaining of active hematochezia. He was shown to have a cherry-red, blood-oozing area of vascular dilation with mucosal prominence in the sigmoid colon by endoscopy, but had no other mucocutaneous vascular abnormalities. A family history was noncontributory. Under the clinical diagnosis of angiodysplasia of the sigmoid colon, he underwent an elliptical resection of the part, based on the intraoperative endoscopic findings. However, histological examination of the surgical specimen revealed a totally different picture from that seen in angiodysplasia: the thin-walled, markedly ectatic, nontortuous veins with hemorrhage were seen only just below the muscularis mucosae, around which the normal ones were shown to coexist. He has had no rebleeding for the past 3 yr. This lesion is considered to be an isolated congenital visceral telangiectasia involving veins. ",0
"Pelvic lipomatosis associated with cystitis glandularis and adenocarcinoma of the bladder. Pelvic lipomatosis is a rare condition characterized by an overgrowth of normal fat in the perivesical and perirectal spaces. Cystitis glandularis, cystica or follicularis has been observed in 75% of the patients with pelvic lipomatosis. Although cystitis glandularis is widely regarded as premalignant few reports have documented its transition to adenocarcinoma. We describe a 41-year-old man with pelvic lipomatosis in whom primary adenocarcinoma of the bladder developed 6 years after a histological diagnosis of cystitis cystica and glandularis was established. To our knowledge this is the second case reported of pelvic lipomatosis associated with proliferative cystitis and adenocarcinoma of the bladder, indicating that intestinal metaplasia of the urothelium may be a precursor of malignancy in these patients.

"Relationship of ischemic heart disease to sudden death. A clinicopathological synthesis is presented of the relationship of ischemic heart disease to sudden cardiac death. The immediate pathophysiological process responsible for sudden cardiac death is a lethal arrhythmia, usually ventricular fibrillation. Although significant coronary atherosclerosis is present in most cases of naturally occurring sudden death, available evidence indicates that several mechanisms can be operative in the pathogenesis of the fatal event. These are (1) acute myocardial infarction in a minority of cases; (2) myocardial ischemia, without infarction, which is initiated either by (a) an exertion-induced increase in myocardial oxygen demand or (b) an acute coronary event often involving plaque degeneration and platelet aggregation; and (3) a primary arrhythmia, usually resulting from altered electrical conduction in the setting of a previous myocardial infarction.

"Possible mechanisms of abnormal norepinephrine sensitivity and reactivity of resistance vessels and the development of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats. A hypothesis. This study examined structural and functional changes of mesenteric resistance vessels in early, developing, and established stages of hypertension development in spontaneously hypertensive rats in an attempt to identify possible mechanisms of the development and maintenance of hypertension. Our results suggest that the development of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats may be caused by genetic structural and functional abnormalities of resistance vessels. Both abnormalities may be caused by hyperreactivity to norepinephrine through an altered signal transduction process, including the regulation of protein kinase C in smooth muscle cells of resistance vessels in spontaneously hypertensive rats.

"Psychological stress and the fibrositis/fibromyalgia syndrome. The relationship of stress and social support to the fibrositis/fibromyalgia syndrome (FS) was investigated by administration of 4 questionnaire instruments to 28 patients with FS, 20 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 28 pain-free normal controls. FS showed higher levels of stress as measured by daily ""hassles"" than did RA or controls. However, on a measure of major life stress, they reported lower levels. No differences were found between groups with regard to daily ""uplifts"" or social support. Correlations between those measures of stress and social support with their scores on the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale showed that the Hassles Scale was significantly related to the AIMS Psychological component.

"Recurrent lateral rectus palsy in childhood. Five patients with recurrent, lateral rectus palsy in childhood, examined at the University of Iowa Hospitals over a period of 22 years, are reported. During the same period, 131 abducens nerve palsy patients, younger than 18 years of age, were evaluated. Eighteen similar patients, most single case reports, are reviewed from the literature. All reported patients, including our own, shared the following features: spontaneous recovery within 6 months in the majority of patients, ipsilateral recurrence, and painless palsy. There is female and left-sided preponderance. Etiology is undetermined. Hypotheses include viral etiology, neurovascular compression by aberrant artery, and migraine. ",0
"Deep femoral to anterior tibial bypass after failed femoropopliteal reconstructions. Deep femoral to anterior tibial artery bypass is a reconstructive technique occasionally applicable when more conventional attempts at revascularization of the distal portion of the leg have failed. Three such patients, in whom the anterior tibial was the only distal patent branch of the popliteal artery, had severe symptoms of arterial insufficiency. Deep femoral to anterior tibial bypass was done using autogenous The distal portion of the deep femoral artery was exposed through an anteromedial distal thigh approach. The three patients have been followed up for a mean of 20.3 months, and each maintains graft patency and marked symptomatic improvement. ",0
"Hazards of internal fixation in the treatment of slipped capital femoral epiphysis. We reviewed the records of 202 patients (308 hips) in whom a slipped capital femoral epiphysis had been fixed with pins or screws. A serious complication that was directly related to the use of internal fixation developed in eighty hips (26 per cent). The rate of complications in the 202 patients was 40 per cent. In thirty-six (18 per cent) of the 202 patients, an additional procedure was done to correct a pin-related complication. Forty-one hip joints had been penetrated by a pin. Other complications included avascular necrosis (fourteen hips), chondrolysis (nine), fracture (one), infection (one), further slippage (one), sciatic-nerve injury (one), and breakage of a screw (eight). Ways of decreasing the incidence of complications of fixation were explored. ",0
"Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase score in patients with cerebrovascular disease and in patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors. Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) activity in peripheral blood was determined in 54 patients with cerebrovascular disease (CVD), 11 patients with primary brain tumor, and 23 patients with metastatic brain tumor. The LAP score of the primary brain tumor patients (155 +/- 40) was significantly higher (P less than 0.03) than the LAP score for cerebrovascular disease patients (96 +/- 87). The LAP score levels of the metastatic brain tumor patients (251 +/- 55) was significantly higher as compared with both the cerebrovascular disease (P less than 0.001) and primary brain tumor groups (P less than 0.001). The LAP score could serve as an additional, although non-specific, marker to assist in the differentiation between cerebrovascular disease and brain tumors. ",0
"Monocortical miniplate fixation of mandibular angle fractures. Noncompression monocortical miniplate fixation of mandibular fractures has become a reliable method of providing rigid fixation and eliminating the need for intermaxillary fixation. Recent studies, using a variety of internal fixation techniques, have described high complication rates at the mandibular angle. This article compares the use of one miniplate vs two miniplates in treatment of angle fractures. Since September 1985, 61 patients with 63 mandibular angle fractures have been treated with miniplates. Forty-four fractures were fixed with two miniplates. Six complications (3.1%) occurred, five of which were in the one-miniplate group. The complication rate in the double-miniplate group is the lowest reported of any plating technique. The use of two miniplates has proved to be an effective method of treating mandibular angle fractures. ",0
"Helicobacter pylori infection: a simplified diagnostic approach. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of endoscopic finding of nodular antritis and rapid urease test (RUT) in order to simplify the approach to the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. Forty-four consecutive patients (mean age 7.9 yr, range 6-13 yr) referred because of recurrent abdominal pain as the main symptom, were prospectively investigated for the presence of H. pylori. H. pylori positivity or negativity was defined as the concordance of two of the following tests: RUT, microbiologic culture, and histologic examination on bioptic samples. RUT sensitivity was 100%, whereas specificity was 87.5%. The presence of nodular antritis had a sensitivity of 96.4% and specificity of 87.5% in H. pylori infection diagnosis. The predictivity value of combined RUT and nodular antritis, whether positive or negative, was 100%. Only in case of discordance do we suggest the utilization of other expensive tools for diagnosis of H. pylori infection. ",0
"Transient neuromuscular impairment resulting from prolonged inhalation of halothane and enflurane. Inhalation anesthesia first with halothane followed by enflurane relieved a patient with status asthmaticus who was refractory to conventional therapy including mechanical ventilation. After 13 days of anesthesia while on mechanical ventilation and employing nondepolarizing muscle relaxants, significant neuromuscular impairment, manifested by tetraplegia and sensory disturbance, developed. Anesthesia was discontinued on day 14, and the patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation on day 16. Over the next two months, the neuromuscular impairment markedly improved. Halothane was associated with cardiac arrhythmias and hepatitis necessitating replacement by enflurane. Enflurane appeared to be as effective a treatment for refractory asthma as halothane. The most probable cause of the neuromuscular impairment in our patient was the long-term use of inhalation anesthetics or nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. ",0
"Race, nutritional status, and survival from breast cancer. The effects of nutritional status on differences in the survival of black and white women with breast cancer were studied in a cohort of 1,960 Georgia women diagnosed during 1975-1979. After data were adjusted for stage of disease, socioeconomic status, and other prognostic factors, poorer survival rates were shown in black women. Within each stage classification, lower levels of serum albumin and hemoglobin and higher relative body weight were more common among blacks and were independently associated with poorer survival. Among women with stage 3 disease, adjustment for these variables substantially reduced the excess mortality rate among blacks, suggesting that racial differences in survival may be partly explained by differences in nutritional status or extent of disease within stage.

"Clinical observation on the association of gallstones and colorectal cancer. A possible association between gallstones, colorectal cancer, and gastric cancer was investigated. The age distribution and mean age of the two cancer groups were identical. The incidence of gallstones in 378 colorectal cancer cases and 869 gastric cancer cases was 7.1% and 5.5%, respectively. Of colorectal cancer cases, 33 cases with multiple carcinomas had a significantly higher gallstone incidence than cases with a solitary carcinoma--24.2% and 5.5%, respectively. The mean age was 5 years older in gallstone cases than in those without gallstones in both cancer groups, and it was 4 years older in multiple-carcinoma cases than in solitary-carcinoma cases in the colorectal cancer group. These results suggest that the higher levels of same causative factors (i.e., dietary fat) are associated with a longer duration of gallstone formation and colorectal cancer development as demonstrated by multiple colorectal-carcinoma cases.

"Immunohistochemical study of cytokeratin expression in normal and pathologic middle ear mucosa of the rat. The expression of cytokeratins in the epithelium of the middle ear and external auditory meatus of the rat was studied on cryosections of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-decalcified specimens by use of a panel of monoclonal antibodies. The normal middle ear epithelium revealed a complex cytokeratin profile, including regional differences. The induction of sterile middle ear effusions resulted in increased cytokeratin expression. Infective effusions were accompanied by both quantitative and qualitative changes in the cytokeratin expression patterns. The differences observed between the cytokeratin profiles of external meatal skin and those of middle ear epithelium may form a useful tool for research into cholesteatoma development. ",0
"Outpatient sedation: an essential addition to gynecologic care for persons with mental retardation. Routine gynecologic care for persons with mental retardation may be difficult to provide, especially to those women who do not allow a pelvic examination to be performed. Of 275 women referred to a multidisciplinary clinic addressing the reproductive health concerns of mentally retarded women, 61 patients (22%) did not allow a gynecologic examination to be performed. The administration of ketamine alone, midazolam alone, or a combination of midazolam and ketamine allowed for the successful performance of a gynecologic examination in 81% of previously uncooperative women. No adverse effects of the medications were noted. We conclude that sedation of difficult-to-examine, mentally handicapped women can be safely performed in the outpatient setting, thus avoiding the need for general anesthesia and its inherent risks.

"Polyglucosan body disease. Adult polyglucosan disease has been described in 15 cases. All had signs of peripheral neuropathy, upper motor neuron signs, and 12 of the 15 had sphincter problems. Dementia was prominent in 8 of 15 cases. We reported 2 cases that contained these clinical features. Electrophysiological studies showed axonal neuropathy. Somatosensory evoked potentials on the second patient were abnormal. Sural nerve biopsy showed clusters of polyglucosan bodies. Although the presence of polyglucosan bodies in biopsy is nonspecific, the number as well as the clinical features are necessary to make the diagnosis. Branching enzyme activity in muscle extracts of the muscles were normal. Hence, a specific enzyme abnormality is not yet known. ",0
"Course of diabetic retinopathy following cataract surgery Five patients with mild to moderate retinopathy to both eyes underwent complication-free cataract surgery in one eye. Within three months of surgery deterioration of the retinopathy was observed in the operated eye only. In four patients there was an increase of intraretinal haemorrhages and hard exudates, accompanied by clinically significant macular oedema manifested as retinal thickening and extensive fluorescein leakage from both the macular and the peripapillary capillary networks. Of these four patients one also developed retinal ischaemia, evident ophthalmoscopically by flame-shaped haemorrhages and cotton-wool spots and angiographically by areas of capillary non-perfusion. The fifth patient showed proliferation of new blood vessels and vitreous haemorrhage. Diabetic patients scheduled for cataract surgery should undergo a thorough preoperative evaluation of any existing retinopathy. Postoperatively they should be followed up at close intervals so that any progression of retinopathy can be promptly detected and considered for laser treatment. ",0
"Cloggology revisited: endoscopic or surgical decompression of malignant biliary obstruction. In this study, 50 consecutive patients over age 60 with obstructive jaundice secondary to malignant stricture of the distal common bile duct were identified by endoscopic cholangiography. The patients were then randomized to palliative therapy with either endoscopic endoprosthesis or bypass surgery. Prospective indices of survival time, complication rates, hospitalization requirements, and quality of life were followed. All 25 patients randomized to endoprosthesis were treated by this procedure, whereas only 19 of 25 patients randomized to bypass surgery underwent operative biliary-digestive anastomosis. No difference in the above indices were found between the two groups. The authors concluded that palliation of obstructive jaundice due to a malignant bile duct stricture with endoscopically placed biliary stent is as effective as operative bypass. ",0
"Isolation of sequences that span the fragile X and identification of a fragile X-related CpG island [published erratum appears in Science 1991 Apr 26;252(5005):494] Yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) were obtained from a 550-kilobase region that contains three probes previously mapped as very close to the locus of the fragile X syndrome. These YACs spanned the fragile site in Xq27.3 as shown by fluorescent in situ hybridization. An internal 200-kilobase segment contained four chromosomal breakpoints generated by induction of fragile X expression. A single CpG island was identified in the cloned region between markers DXS463 and DXS465 that appears methylated in mentally retarded fragile X males, but not in nonexpressing male carriers of the mutation nor in normal males. This CpG island may indicate the presence of a gene involved in the clinical phenotype of the syndrome. ",0
"Surgical removal of subfoveal neovascularization in the presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome. We treated two patients with presumed ocular histoplasmosis, subfoveal neovascular membranes, and progressive visual acuity loss to 20/400. Vitreoretinal surgical techniques were used to remove the subfoveal membranes. Visual acuity returned to 20/20 with seven months of follow-up in one patient (Case 1) and to 20/40 with three months of follow-up in the other patient (Case 2). No evidence of persistent or current subretinal neovascular membranes in either patient have been noted. These preliminary results suggest that vitreoretinal surgical techniques may be successful in mechanically removing subfoveal neovascular membranes with preservation of overlying neurosensory retina and thus preservation of central visual acuity.

"Cytogenetic evidence of clonality in a case of pigmented villonodular synovitis. Pigmented villonodular synovitis is an uncommon benign lesion that is characterized by diffuse synovial proliferation. Based on animal models, this lesion has been conjectured previously to be reactive in nature. In this report, the authors present the histologic and cytogenetic findings for a pigmented villonodular synovitis that was excised from the right knee of a 47-year-old man. Trisomy 7 was observed in 24 of 75 (35%) metaphases obtained from short-term culture of cells from this tumor. These findings suggest that some cases of pigmented villonodular synovitis represent clonal, neoplastic proliferations. ",0
"Milk protein enteropathy after acute infectious gastroenteritis: experimental and clinical observations. Animal models of allergic gastroenteropathy have defined both morphologic and physiologic changes that accompany the immune-mediated reaction to a dietary protein. In such models a broadening of the allergic response to other dietary proteins present in the gastrointestinal tract may occur during the localized anaphylactic reaction. The characteristic histologic intestinal findings of food protein-induced enteropathy may develop in selected infants with protracted diarrhea after infectious enteritis. Mechanisms underlying the induction of this response remain to be explained, but they may in part be similar to the broadening of the hypersensitivity response seen in experimental models of allergic enteropathy.

"Severe cerebral and systemic necrotizing vasculitis developing during pregnancy in a case of systemic lupus erythematosus. We describe a fatal case of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) developing cerebral and systemic necrotizing vasculitis during pregnancy. The patient was discovered to have SLE at 14 weeks' gestation. Although the symptoms disappeared without treatment with corticosteroid in the 2nd trimester, she presented with meningoencephalitis due to vasculitis in the 3rd trimester. Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN)-like necrotizing vasculitis of the small muscular arteries and arterioles, with acute and healing lesions in the leptomeninges, brain parenchyma and visceral organs was observed at postpartum autopsy. PAN-like vasculitis in the central nervous system is quite rare in SLE. This case is also suggestive in terms of the influence of pregnancy on the activity of SLE. ",0
Platelet norepinephrine and epinephrine concentration in patients with pheochromocytoma. Platelet and plasma catecholamine concentrations were determined in 17 patients with surgically proven pheochromocytoma (mean age 42.3 years); in 31 patients with borderline hypertension (mean age 35.3 years) and in 9 healthy controls (mean age 39.3 years). Both platelet norepinephrine and epinephrine were significantly increased in patients with pheochromocytoma when compared with hypertensive and control groups (P less than .001). No correlation between platelet and plasma catecholamines was detected in all studied groups. The diagnostic accuracy of platelet catecholamine in pheochromocytoma is limited since increased platelet norepinephrine was found in 35.5% and increased platelet epinephrine was found in 19.4% of patients with essential hypertension. ,0
"Rigid spine syndrome with respiratory failure. The pathogenesis and therapy of respiratory failure in the rigid spine syndrome are discussed in two cases who improved with respiratory assistance. In both cases, the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide were reversed in arterial blood gas analysis and %VC was less than 30%. Remission from respiratory failure has been obtained by the use of a ventilator during the night. The cause of the respiratory failure in both cases was severe restrictive respiratory dysfunction due to extreme flattening of the chest and fixation of the thorax during respiration as a result of contracture of costovertebral joints. All the previously reported cases of the rigid spine syndrome with respiratory failure died. Appropriate use of the ventilator can improve the prognosis. ",0
"Moustache appearance in craniopharyngiomas: unique magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomographic findings of perifocal edema. This report describes two cases of craniopharyngioma with perifocal edema. In both patients, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that the tumors occupied the suprasellar cistern, invaginated the floor of the 3rd ventricle and were tightly adherent to the ventricular walls. The intraventricular portions of the tumors were cystic, containing protein-rich fluid as suggested by MRI and confirmed by operative findings. There was perifocal edema in the hypothalamus adjacent to the intraventricular tumor, the optic tracts, and the posterior limbs of the internal capsules, resembling the shape of a moustache on axial computed tomographic and MRI scans. The perifocal edema subsided after treatment of the intraventricular tumor by surgical resection or radiation therapy. The ""moustache"" appearance seems a unique, characteristic feature of perifocal edema, which is observed infrequently with certain craniopharyngiomas. ",0
"The relationship between hypochondriasis and medical illness. Forty-one Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III-Revised hypochondriacs were accrued from a primary care practice. Seventy-five control subjects were selected at random from among the remainder of the patients in the same clinic. All subjects completed a structured diagnostic interview and standardized self-report questionnaires. Medical morbidity was assessed with a medical record audit and with primary physicians' ratings. The hypochondriacal and comparison samples did not differ in aggregate medical morbidity, although the hypochondriacal sample had more undiagnosed complaints and nonspecific findings in their medical records. Within the comparison sample, higher levels of medical morbidity were associated with higher levels of hypochondriacal symptoms. This occurred primarily because the most serious medical disorders were associated with more bodily preoccupation, disease conviction, and somatization. Within the hypochondriacal sample, no correlation was found between the degree of hypochondriasis and the extent of medical morbidity. ",0
"Cell cycling in bladder carcinoma determined by monoclonal antibody Ki67. Current methods of predicting prognosis in transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder fail to provide consistently reliable information about future tumour behaviour. The monoclonal antibody Ki67 recognises an antigen present in actively dividing cells and Ki67 reactivity has been shown to correlate with conventional prognostic indicators in several tumours. In this study, Ki67 antibody was used to determine the proportions of cells undergoing active division in 26 transitional cell carcinomas of the bladder. The proportion of cells stained in muscle invasive tumours (12.3 +/- 5.4%) was significantly greater than in superficial tumours (4.3 +/- 1.9%) and poorly differentiated tumours showed significantly greater proportions of cells staining compared with well or moderately well differentiated tumours. These results show that Ki67 reactivity correlates with high tumour stage and poor differentiation. Ki67 staining provides an easy method of determining tumour cell turnover that might provide additional prognostic information. ",0
"Anti-Kell in pregnancy. A review of data on haemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) collected in Newcastle upon Tyne over 25 years revealed 194 pregnancies in which anti-Kell was the only antibody detected. Sixteen affected babies were born. None was hydropic, three had very severe disease but all survived. There were also three stillbirths, none of which had post-mortem appearances of HDN. The highest recorded anti-Kell titres in individual patients ranged from 1/1 to 1/2048 and bore no relation to the severity of the disease. Of the eight pregnancies in which amniotic fluid examination predicted a high risk of stillbirth, half resulted in unaffected babies. We suggest that haemolytic disease caused by anti-Kell is less severe than suggested by some workers. The use of guidelines developed from the study of Rhesus disease to determine the need for intervention in women with anti-Kell may be inappropriate. ",0
"Rupture of coronary vasa vasorum as a trigger of acute myocardial infarction. Some controversy has always existed regarding the presence and extent of the vasa vasorum--the nutrient vessels in the wall of the human aorta--in the coronary arteries. Now, cinemicrographic studies using silicone polymer injections in cleared human hearts have identified the vasa vasorum of coronary arteries, revealing evidence of neovascularization in the region of atherosclerotic plaques. These studies suggest an important role for the vasa vasorum in the pathogenesis of coronary atherosclerosis and its sequelae, especially intramural hemorrhage and vascular spasm. The wall of the human coronary artery in regions of atherosclerotic injury may be particularly rich in capillary vessels of the vasa vasorum. From this, the evidence suggests that with the morning increase in blood pressure, fragile neovascular structures of the vasa vasorum may be more prone to rupture and may be responsible, in part, for the circadian variation in myocardial infarction.

"Hepatic arterial embolization in cases of extensive celiac arterial stenosis. Transarterial hepatic embolization was attempted in 10 and succeeded in nine patients with hepatocellular carcinoma accompanied by extensive celiac arterial stenosis. All catheterization was done through the femoral artery. In six cases, the tip of the catheter (2.5-F ball-tip microcatheter in three cases, 4-F ball-tip supple catheter in three cases) was placed in the proper hepatic artery through the pancreaticoduodenal collaterals. In three cases, a ball-tip microcatheter was injected from the guiding catheter, which was placed in a pinhole of the celiac trunk. These techniques involving flow-guided ball-tip catheters are of great value for hepatic arterial catheterization in cases of extensive celiac arterial stenosis. ",0
"Hematoporphyrin photodynamic therapy: is there truly a future in head and neck oncology? Reflections on a 5-year experience. Photodynamic therapy, which consists of the selective destruction of tumors using a combination of a photosensitizer administered systemically (dihematoporphyrin ether) and an argon dye-pumped laser, has provoked profound interest amongst oncologists and has particularly titillated head and neck oncologists with its potential. Unfortunately, no multi-institutional trials for head and neck tumors have been introduced, and the literature is replete with anecdotal reports from individual researchers on the management of advanced cancers for palliation, superficial early cancers, and field cancerization of the mucosa (""condemned mucosa""). A personal 5-year experience with 41 head and neck cancers was reviewed, as was the current literature. An attempt was made to place in perspective the true role and future direction of this technology. ",0
"Renal abscess in children. Three cases of renal abscesses in children are described to illustrate the variable presenting features. An additional 23 pediatric cases, reported over the past ten years, were reviewed for clinical features and therapy. Fever, loin pain, and leukocytosis were common presenting features, but less than half of all abscesses were associated with either an abnormal urinalysis or a positive urine culture. The presenting features were sometimes confused with appendicitis, peritonitis, or a Wilms tumor. An organism was identified in 17 cases--Escherichia coli in 9 children and Staphylococcus aureus in 8 children. The majority of E. coli infections occurred in girls and the majority of S. aureus infections occurred in boys. Reflux was documented in 5 patients, and 2 children had a possible extrarenal source of infection. Antibiotics alone produced a cure in 10 children (38%), but 16 children (62%) required a surgical procedure. ",0
"Esophageal involvement in pemphigus vulgaris: a clinical, histologic, and immunopathologic study. Eleven newly diagnosed patients and one patient with pemphigus vulgaris who relapsed underwent endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Three patients had blisters or erosions and two had longitudinal lines of erythema in the esophageal mucosa. In four patients histopathologic examination showed findings of pemphigus vulgaris but direct immunofluorescence was positive in all patients. This study demonstrates that the immunopathologic disturbance in pemphigus vulgaris involves the entire length of the esophagus, although only some patients have clinical or histologic involvement. To the best of our knowledge this is the first histopathologic and direct immunofluorescence study of esophageal involvement in patients with untreated pemphigus vulgaris. ",0
"Autoradiographic evaluation of monoclonal antibodies' access to melanoma-associated antigens in melanoma xenografts. Autoradiography of nude mice bearing human malignant melanoma xenografts was performed to characterize the distribution pattern of radioiodinated anti-melanoma monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) and fragments in macroscopic tumor nodules. Non-uniformity of radioactivity distribution was seen in all MoAb-xenograft combinations. The predominant patterns were marked deposition of radioactivity either in the periphery of nodules or in sharply delimited intra-tumoral foci. These patterns were generated by limitations in the accessibility of melanoma tissue rather than gross necrosis or heterogeneity of antigen expression. Computer-aided densitometry of autoradiograms was used to elaborate the difference of accumulation in intra-tumoral hot spots versus cold areas. It was found that increasing uniformity was achieved by increasing the dose of MoAb (i.e., intact IgG) injected, whereas a reduction in the size of MoAb (IgG greater than F(ab')2 greater than Fab) showed no such effect.

"Update on the epidemiology of anorexia nervosa in a defined region of Switzerland. In this follow-up investigation, the authors studied all Swiss women in the canton of Zurich who developed anorexia nervosa between ages 12 and 25 years and who were hospitalized for the first time with this diagnosis between 1983 and 1985. Data were compared with those from an earlier study, which focused on the periods 1956-1958, 1963-1965, and 1973-1975. The incidence of anorexia nervosa did not increase significantly during 1983-1985 compared to 1973-1975, in contrast to the constant increase found between 1956 and 1975. However, the more frequent use of vomiting and abuse of laxatives in 1983-1985 may indicate an increase in cases with mixed features of anorexia nervosa and bulimia. ",0
"MRI, CT, SPECT, PET: their use in diagnosing dementia. The differential diagnosis of the dementia syndrome may pose a difficult clinical problem, since the most common dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), is marked by normal laboratory tests. Neuroimaging has played an important role in evaluating the demented patient, and its uses are growing. Computed tomography (CT) is useful for excluding reversible and treatable causes of dementia, such as subdural hematoma and tumor. More recently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has improved our ability to diagnose vascular disease and may show the presence of cerebral infarcts and white matter disease not visible on CT. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET), techniques that visualize such cerebral functions as glucose metabolism and blood flow, may provide positive evidence supportive of the diagnosis of AD.

"Fetal platelet counts in thrombocytopenic pregnancy Fetal platelet counts were assessed by percutaneous umbilical blood sampling in 64 pregnancies (62 women) with maternal thrombocytopenia. In 33 pregnancies associated with chronic immune thrombocytopenia, 11 of the fetuses had platelet counts below 150 x 10(9)/l and 4 were severely thrombocytopenic (less than 50 x 10(9)/l). In 31 pregnancies with symptomless maternal thrombocytopenia as an incidental finding, 4 fetuses were thrombocytopenic, 1 of them severely. Maternal indices, including antiplatelet antibodies, did not correlate with risk of fetal thrombocytopenia; and in those with repeat measurements there was no evidence of benefit from treatment with either corticosteroids (4 cases) or intravenous immunoglobulin (3 cases). Percutaneous umbilical blood sampling, a safe procedure in experienced hands, provides accurate platelet counts in thrombocytopenic pregnancy, as an aid to decisions on mode of delivery and to assessment of treatments.

"Lymphomatoid granulomatosis presenting as ulcerodestructive gastrointestinal tract lesions in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection. A new association. We describe cases of severe odynophagia, extensive oral ulcerations, and bowel perforation in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection that were caused by lymphomatoid granulomatosis. Such presentations in human immunodeficiency virus-infected individuals are usually ascribed to other causes and may be incorrectly treated on an empiric basis. In addition, deep tissue specimens obtained at the margin of ulcerative lesions are often necessary for definitive diagnosis. We review our limited treatment experience with zidovudine, interferon alfa, and H2 blockers in our patients. Based on the markedly increased frequency in which lymphomatoid granulomatosis is being diagnosed at our institution in the post-human immunodeficiency virus era, we postulated an association between these two entities.

"The combined use of apraclonidine and pilocarpine during laser iridotomy in a Hispanic population. Early postoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) rise is a frequent and vision-threatening complication of laser surgery for glaucoma. Recent studies show that apraclonidine, a new alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, can reduce the incidence of this problem. In a randomized, double-masked prospective study, we explored the efficacy of apraclonidine combined with pilocarpine during laser iridotomy in a Hispanic population. A significantly lower early postoperative IOP with less frequent severe pressure spikes occurred in the apraclonidine-treated patients. The addition of pilocarpine did not interfere with the beneficial effect of this medication. Of particular interest was the fact that chronic angle-closure glaucoma was the diagnosis in all patients who had a significant postoperative IOP rise in this study. ",0
"The acute and insidious onset of pulmonary metastatic transitional cell carcinoma. Transitional cell carcinoma is a common urologic neoplasm. Although pulmonary metastases from this tumor are often not appreciated clinically, they are frequently documented in autopsy studies. Therefore, the clinical recognition of this condition can be problematic. To illustrate this point, we present three patients with progressive unexplained dyspnea and histories of transitional cell carcinoma. Since ineffective and possibly detrimental therapeutic approaches may be initiated, a high index of suspicion for pulmonary metastatic embolization must be maintained. Early histologic identification of these metastatic emboli and initiation of effective chemotherapy may prove beneficial for improved quality of life. ",0
"A retrospective study of spontaneous remission and long-term outcome in patients with infantile spasms. The spontaneous remission rate and long-term outcome in 44 patients with infantile spasms not treated with hormonal drugs were studied. The cumulative spontaneous remission rate during the first 12 months after onset of infantile spasms, as determined by retrospective analysis, was as follows: 1 month, 2%; 2 months, 2%; 3 months, 5%; 4 months, 7%; 5 months, 9%; 6 months, 11%; 7 months, 11%; 8 months, 14%; 9 months, 16%; 10 months, 18%; 11 months, 25%; 12 months, 25%. The average age at follow-up was 80 months. Nine percent of patients had normal development or only mild impairment. The remainder showed various degrees of retardation. These data should be useful in the design and interpretation of therapeutic drug trials in patients with infantile spasms. ",0
"The beta globin 3' enhancer element confers regulated expression on the human gamma globin gene in the human embryonic-fetal erythroleukemia cell line K562. We have constructed fusion genes comprised of gamma and beta globin elements and globin sequences linked to neomycin resistance (neoR) genes to define the cis acting sequences responsible for developmental stage-specific expression and induction of fetal globin genes in embryonic-fetal erythroleukemia K562 cells. The results indicate that the gamma promoter is required for proper initiation of transcription. However, the accumulation of gamma globin transcripts in response to hemin induction requires the additional presence of either gamma intervening sequence 2 or the 3' enhancer element of the beta globin gene. Thus, the gamma promoter may provide the elements for developmental stage-specific gene expression during fetal life. By contrast, the beta 3' enhancer is erythroid-specific but not developmental stage- or gene-specific. ",0
"Years of potential life lost: another indicator of the impact of cutaneous malignant melanoma on society. Years of potential life lost (YPLL) is an indicator of premature mortality that complements traditional incidence and mortality rates and that facilitates comparisons among different cancers. We calculated YPLL from cutaneous melanoma and 11 other cancers routinely recorded and tracked by Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER). YPLL from cutaneous melanoma ranked eighth for persons younger than 65 years of age and fourth for those 20 to 49 years of age. An average of 17.1 YPLL per death were due to melanoma, one of the highest rates for adult-onset cancers. The results of our study, the first to apply YPLL to cutaneous melanoma, emphasize the disproportionate impact of this cancer on young and middle-aged adults and reemphasize the importance of this cancer as a public health priority.

"Neutrophil dysfunction in glycogen storage disease Ib: association with Crohn's-like colitis. Two cases of patients with Crohn's-like colitis and glycogen storage disease Ib have been reported previously. In the current report, chronic inflammatory bowel disease that developed in another adolescent with this glycogenosis is described, thereby corroborating the association. The neutrophil dysfunction observed in glycogen storage disease Ib is the most likely predisposing factor. Neutrophil function was investigated in our patient in an attempt to shed light on the pathogenesis of his intestinal inflammation. The patient displayed reduced neutrophil chemotaxis to zymosan-activated serum, N-formyl-methionine-phenylalanine, and Escherichia coli bacteria-derived factor and reduced intracellular killing of Staphylococcus aureus 502A. Others have found this defective bacteriocidal activity to be caused by impaired oxidative metabolism. The recent recognition of chronic inflammatory bowel disease in glycogen storage disease Ib, as well as in chronic granulomatous disease, suggests that further study of respiratory burst activity of neutrophils in Crohn's disease is warranted.

"Use of the levator scapulae muscle flap in head and neck reconstruction. There are numerous techniques available for reconstruction of defects following composite resection of oral cavity and oropharyngeal tumors. No single technique is applicable in all situations. The levator scapulae muscle flap is well known for its application in carotid protection. Little attention is paid to its usefulness in other aspects of head and neck reconstruction. We have been using the levator scapulae muscle flap for a variety of reconstructive problems. The flap is useful for buttressing intraoral suture lines, closing intraoral defects, and providing soft tissue to fill in dead spaces and bulk out lateral and anterior oral defects. The levator flap was found to be easy to elevate, safe, and reliable with a minimum of wound complications. A review of 18 patients, representative case studies, and a discussion of surgical technique and relevant anatomy and blood supply is presented. ",0
"Neuroophthalmologic effects of intravenous magnesium sulfate. To test the hypothesis that visual disturbances are more common during intravenous magnesium sulfate administration than at 1 to 4 days after discontinuation of the drug, 13 women underwent bedside neuroophthalmologic examinations during intravenous magnesium sulfate tocolysis at 2.0 to 3.0 gm hr and again at 1 to 4 days after cessation of therapy. Visual symptoms were common during intravenous magnesium sulfate administration. Blurred vision was present in 12 of 13 patients and diplopia was present in 10 of 13 patients. Abnormal findings during neuroophthalmologic examination occurred in all patients during intravenous magnesium sulfate administration. Findings included ptosis, accommodative and convergence insufficiency, and abnormal pupillary responsiveness to light and near. All patients were symptom-free and had normal examinations after magnesium sulfate was discontinued. These findings suggest that visual disturbances with therapeutic magnesium sulfate are common. ",0
"Genetic diagnosis of Lynch syndrome II in an extended colorectal cancer-prone family. Knowledge of colon cancer genetics, with particular attention to precision in hereditary cancer syndrome diagnosis, can often enable highly targeted surveillance and management strategies for patients at high genetic risk. Unfortunately, the patient's family history of cancer is often given minimal attention, and knowledge of hereditary cancer syndromes is frequently limited. Indeed, many physicians still consider familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) as the only genetic risk factor for colorectal cancer. This concern with FAP was noted in a colorectal cancer-prone kindred which for decades had been thought to manifest that syndrome. However, after meticulous genetic, medical, and pathologic studies, the cardinal phenotypic characteristics of Lynch syndrome II were observed. The potential for cancer control in current and future generations of families like this one clearly mandates the need for computerized registries which could transmit current information about hereditary colon cancer syndrome diagnosis, surveillance, and management.

"Anatomic correlations of the long-axis views in biplane transesophageal echocardiography. The number of views obtainable during transesophageal echocardiography (TE) has been limited by the fixed position of the transducer at the end of the probe. This has confined standard TE studies to short-axis tomography of the heart and aorta. Recently, a biplane TE probe has become available that is capable of both long- and short-axis imaging. This study prospectively assessed the application of the long-axis plane of the biplane probe in providing complementary long-axis views in ambulatory patients. Six standard long-axis views could be obtained and were compared with corresponding anatomic sections to illustrate anatomic relations and facilitate structure identification. The long-axis views provide a better appreciation of the 3-dimensional nature of cardiac anatomy and function, especially in demonstrating the relation of vertically aligned structures. ",0
"Acute gastroenteritis in infants under 6 months old. Sixty two babies under the age of 6 months who were admitted with gastroenteritis completed a study of gradual refeeding compared with abrupt refeeding after a period of rehydration. There was no difference in the incidence of recurrence of diarrhoea due to lactose intolerance, effect on weight, or duration of hospital stay. Twenty six babies (42%) had recurrence of diarrhoea after refeeding, all of whom settled with the introduction of a lactose free soya based formula. Well nourished babies under 6 months of age with mild to moderately severe gastroenteritis can be fed immediately with full strength milk feeds after rehydration. The introduction of a lactose free soya based preparation may provide an alternative to repeated attempts at regrading with cows' milk feeds in those patients with lactose intolerance. ",0
"Therapeutic options in acute diverticulitis. Diverticulitis is a serious intra-abdominal infection that ultimately afflicts about one in four patients having colonic diverticulosis. The illness may be indolent or fulminant, depending on the degree of colonic spillage and its containment. Most patients require hospitalization, and medical therapy suffices in about three fourths. Those who fail aggressive medical management and those with recurrent acute attacks, diffuse peritonitis, abscess, persistent obstruction, or fistulization require surgical intervention. Abdominal CT scanning has supplanted the contrast enema as the acute diagnostic procedure of choice and allows guided percutaneous drainage of large abscesses in selected cases. This approach helps realize the surgical ideal of a single elective operation without a temporary colostomy. For those patients still requiring emergency surgery, the two-stage approach employing resection of the diseased colon at the initial operation is far superior to the older three-stage approach. ",0
"Celiac disease, brain atrophy, and dementia. We report 5 patients who developed dementia before age 60 and were subsequently found to have celiac disease (CD). Intellectual deterioration ranged from moderate to severe, and diffuse cerebral or cerebellar atrophy was found on brain CT. Diagnosis of CD was confirmed by findings of subtotal villous atrophy in jejunal biopsy specimens and positive serum reticulin and gliadin antibodies. Conspicuously, gastrointestinal symptoms were mild. The gluten-free diet failed to improve the neurologic disability except in 1 patient. CD is a multisystem disorder and may play a role in some cases of presenile dementia. Although the pathogenetic mechanisms are obscure, immunologic mechanisms are implicated. ",0
"Progression of peripheral occlusive arterial disease in diabetes mellitus. What factors are predictive? The clinical, biochemical, and vascular laboratory measurements potentially associated with the development and/or progression of peripheral occlusive arterial disease (POAD) were assessed during a 4-year period in 110 normal control subjects, 112 patients with POAD without diabetes mellitus, 240 patients with diabetes mellitus without POAD, and 100 patients with diabetes mellitus and POAD. Age, history of hypertension or coronary heart disease, history of cigarette smoking, presence of POAD, systolic blood pressure, and beta-thromboglobulin level were associated with progression of POAD. A multivariate logistic regression model indicated that the presence of diabetes mellitus or POAD or both at baseline, decreased postexercise ankle-brachial index, increased arm systolic blood pressure, and current smoking were independently associated with progression of POAD. This study suggests that cessation of smoking and control of hypertension are essential treatment modifications to decrease the risk of progression of peripheral vascular disease in diabetic patients.

"The case for porous-coated hip implants. The femoral side. A series of 1163 total hip arthroplasties (THAs) using porous-coated femoral components were roentgenographically assessed for implant fixation. For 959 primary THAs followed from two to 12 years, the femoral revision rate was 1% and the ten-year survivorship rate was 96.4%; 150 young patients had a fixation failure incidence of only 1.3% at a mean follow-up period of 6.4 years; in 204 revision THAs, the femoral re-revision rate was 4% at a mean follow-up period of 53.4 months. Failures were largely related to inadequate femoral canal filling. Because of refinements in implant design and surgical techniques, a press fit of the implant is currently achieved in 94% of cases compared to 36% during the first five years. Porous-coated femoral components have yielded results equivalent to those with cement in primary THAs. Excellent results were observed in relatively young patients and patients with revisions. ",0
"Propranolol and the morning increase in sudden cardiac death: (the beta-blocker heart attack trial experience). To provide insight into the protective effect of propranolol on mortality after myocardial infarction observed in the beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial, the time of occurrence of sudden cardiac death was examined in this population. Between 5 A.M. and 11 A.M., 25 of the 56 total deaths (38%) occurred in the placebo patients compared with 11 of 45 (24%) in the propranolol patients. Excluding this period, there were nearly equal numbers of sudden cardiac deaths in the propranolol and placebo groups. This retrospective analysis suggests that beta blockade is protective during the morning hours when a surge of sympathetic activity may increase the risk of sudden cardiac death. ",0
"Bacterial endocarditis presenting as acute myocardial infarction: a cautionary note for the era of reperfusion. Coronary embolism is a known complication of bacterial endocarditis that sometimes causes acute myocardial infarction. The necessity for rapidly restoring coronary artery perfusion and the time constraints governing clinical decisions may prevent endocarditis from being diagnosed before pharmacologic or mechanical thrombolysis. This report describes the first documented cases of coronary angioplasty in two patients with acute myocardial infarction caused by bacterial endocarditis, and reviews the literature on coronary artery complications of bacterial endocarditis. The first patient developed a coronary artery mycotic aneurysm at the dilatation site; the second experienced a small intracerebral hemorrhage following reperfusion. It is, of course, unwise to generalize from two cases, but we believe that in patients who are most likely to have endocarditis as the cause of acute myocardial infarction, the impulse to follow conventional strategies for coronary reperfusion should be tempered by thoughts of possible consequences.

"Herniation of the antral membrane through an extraction site. Report of a case. A case of herniation of the antral membrane through a recent extraction site is presented. The lesion was initially diagnosed as a tumor by the referring dentist. Oroantral fistulas are not an uncommon finding after dental extractions. It is rare, however, to see herniation of the antral membrane with large polyps extending through the fistula into the oral cavity. A search of the literature revealed only two other such cases. Surgical removal of the polyps and closure of the oroantral fistula by means of a buccal sliding flap technique is discussed. ",0
"Parietal cell vagotomy and dilatation for peptic duodenal stricture. Gastric outlet obstruction due to peptic duodenal stricture (pyloric stenosis) was treated with parietal cell vagotomy and dilatation of the stricture in 32 patients. Follow-up is in the range of 5 years in 37.4% of the patients, while 6 to 10 years follow-up is available in 62.4% of the patients. At their last follow-up, 74.9% of the patients were in either Visick 1 or 2 clinical status. Recurrence rates have been 3.1% at 1 year, 9.3% at 5 years, and 21.8% after 6 to 10 years follow-up. There has been only one instance (3.1%) of restenosis. Two patients required reoperation because of recurrence and one of them died. ",0
"Internuclear ophthalmoplegia in the Chiari type II malformation. We describe 3 cases of Chiari type II malformation presenting with bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO). Although prominent, the INO was not an isolated sign in any of the patients; superimposed abduction paresis was present in 2, and deficits in smooth pursuit, optokinetic nystagmus, and vestibulo-ocular responses were present in 3. Two had hydrocephalus: 1 was clinically unchanged without therapy after 5 years; the other did not improve with shunting. Findings in our 3 patients, along with the 4 previously reported, confirm that INO is 1 manifestation of widespread brainstem or cerebellar dysfunction. Its origin is probably multifactorial, related to hydrocephalus, vascular compromise, direct neuronal distortion, or congenital neural malformation. ",0
"Serial neurobehavioral assessments in preterm infants. The purpose of this study was to compare serial neurobehavioral assessments in a sample of preterm infants with intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) to those of a group of unaffected preterm infants. Of the 30 infants included in the study, 5 infants had a grade III or IV/VI intraventricular hemorrhage. Infants with IVH demonstrated more abnormalities in mental status and a cluster of abnormal neurologic findings (persistent ankle clonus, tremulousness, and brisk deep tendon reflexes). Of the 30 infants, 20 infants were included in a brain metabolism study. Infants who had experienced an IVH had significantly different brain metabolism findings, as measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). There was a significant correlation between one measure of brain metabolism (PCr/PI) and the neurobehavioral assessment rating for infants with IVH. ",0
"Myocardial revascularization for the third time. Clinical characteristics and follow-up. Twenty-five patients presenting for a third revascularization procedure were retrospectively reviewed at Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, IL. This represents 0.5 percent of the total revascularization cases over a five-year period extending from 1985 through 1989. Perioperative mortality was none, and seven complications occurred in six patients. Internal mammary arteries were used for revascularization in 60 percent of this group. Follow-up reveals that only one patient has died secondary to an arrhythmia. All patients except one are symptomatically improved, and 18 patients remain angina free at a mean follow-up of 22.3 months. It is therefore concluded that patients are clinically improved with a third revascularization, and this procedure should be offered as an effective means of treatment. ",0
"Use of gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis and management of posterior fossa hemangioblastomas. The diagnosis of central nervous system hemangioblastoma as well as the surgical treatment requires the accurate radiologic visualization of both the cystic and solid components of the tumor. We report two cases of posterior fossa hemangioblastoma examined with gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, which clearly defined the tumor nodule that was not visualized on noncontrast magnetic resonance imaging, contrast-enhanced computed tomography scans, or angiography. In both cases the operative findings precisely correlated with the gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance image. Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging is the examination of choice for preoperative evaluation of posterior fossa hemangioblastoma. In cases of von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, magnetic resonance imaging is a useful tool for clinical screening as well as follow-up. ",0
"Prognostic factors in craniofacial surgery. From 1979 to 1989, 21 patients underwent craniofacial resection for malignancies involving the anterior skull base. Histologic types included 8 squamous cell carcinomas, 3 chondrosarcomas, 2 melanomas, 2 basal cell carcinomas, 2 adenocarcinomas, 2 poorly differentiated carcinomas, 1 malignant schwannoma, and 1 malignant hemangiopericytoma. Survival was 57%, with follow-up of 41 months. A 50% complication rate included osteomyelitis, cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea, meningitis, brain abscess, epidural abscess, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone. Recurrent disease occurred in 9 patients (41%), the most reliable predictor being dural invasion indicated preoperatively by CT scan or at operation. Patients demonstrating dural involvement (N = 9) had a 22% survival rate, while patients without (N = 12) had a survival rate of 83%. The impact of dural invasion on long-term survival is emphasized. Though complications were frequent, long-term results were favorable. ",0
"Lymphomatous polyneuropathy. Biopsy of clinically involved nerve and successful treatment. We present a patient with large-cell lymphoma in remission who, over several weeks, developed widespread multifocal polyneuropathy. There was involvement of all four limbs, most severely the left upper extremity that had become useless. Biopsy of the left saphenous nerve within an area of sensory loss showed lymphoma in the endoneurium. There was no other evidence of recurrent lymphoma despite extensive investigation, including bone marrow, lumbar puncture, magnetic resonance imaging of the spine, and computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis. Intensive systemic chemotherapy was accompanied by nearly complete recovery. Biopsy of a symptomatic nerve is preferable to routine sural nerve biopsy in this condition because of its patchy distribution. Treatment with systematic chemotherapy can be effective. ",0
"Hypoglycemia, hypotonia, and cardiomyopathy: the evolving clinical picture of long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. Inherited defects in fatty acid oxidation, which have been described and diagnosed with increasing frequency in the last decade, are most commonly attributed to a deficiency in the activity of medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. Few cases of the related enzyme defect of long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity have been reported. An infant with documented long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency is described with a detailed metabolic profile, long-term clinical follow-up, and response to treatment. This patient is compared with the seven previously published cases of this disorder in order to stress the unique features of the initial presentation, more subtle late manifestations of the disease, and clinical and biochemical differentiation from the more common medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. This report stresses the enlarging spectrum of the clinical presentation and natural history of this defect in fatty acid oxidation. ",0
"Upper tract tumours following cystectomy for bladder cancer. Is routine intravenous urography worthwhile? The incidence and presentation of upper tract tumours were studied in 180 patients who had previously undergone cystectomy for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Intravenous urography was performed routinely 3 months after cystectomy, 1 year later and at 3-yearly intervals thereafter. Ten patients developed upper tract tumours; 1 presented with loin pain and the remainder with haematuria. Six patients underwent nephroureterectomy and 5 of them lived for at least 4 years; 4 were inoperable and only 1 survived longer than 6 months. In this series, all patients with upper tract tumours presented with symptoms and routine intravenous urography failed to detect any asymptomatic lesions. Routine radiological assessment of the upper tracts to detect tumours is not justified following cystectomy. ",0
"Hyperplastic polyps seen at sigmoidoscopy are markers for additional adenomas seen at colonoscopy. Asymptomatic individuals undergoing screening flexible sigmoidoscopy were prospectively studied. Polyps were found in 185 subjects. The endoscopist recorded an opinion on the polyps' histology based on endoscopic appearance. No polyps were removed at sigmoidoscopy. All subjects with rectosigmoid polyps then underwent colonoscopy and polypectomy. Of them, 99 subjects (54%) had at least one rectosigmoid adenoma, 69 (37%) had only hyperplastic polyps, and 17 (9%) had other findings. The endoscopists' opinion of the histopathology of polyps at sigmoidoscopy was correct for 61% of the lesions. Of subjects with adenomatous rectosigmoid polyps, 29% had additional adenomas at more proximal sites. Proximal adenomas were found in 28% of patients with hyperplastic rectosigmoid polyps. Patients with rectosigmoid hyperplastic polyps had the same risk for additional proximal adenomas as patients with rectosigmoid adenomatous polyps. ",0
"A complex ileovaginal fistula with associated obstructive uropathy in a patient with Crohn's disease: technical considerations and review of the literature. A high index of suspicion of an ileogenital fistula should be aroused by a patient with Crohn's disease, weight loss, malnutrition, and a persistent vaginal discharge. Preoperative gastrointestinal and genitourinary evaluation should be used in an attempt to localize the fistulous origin as well as concomitant fistulae. The principles of surgical therapy include preoperative ureteral catheters, resection of the diseased bowel and fistulous segment of bowel, and interposition of healthy tissue (ie, omentum) between the bowel anastomosis and the vaginal cuff.

"Occlusive vasculopathy in systemic lupus erythematosus. Association with anticardiolipin antibody Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and with antiphospholipid antibody are subject to sudden occlusion of multiple blood vessels. We describe two patients with systemic lupus erythematosus with acute, catastrophic, widespread non-inflammatory visceral vascular occlusions associated with high-titer antiphospholipid antibody. The histopathologic features clearly distinguished these patients from classic systemic lupus erythematosus vasculitis. We further suggest that, based on a probable pathogenesis related to the presence of antiphospholipid antibody, and based on the non-inflammatory vascular occlusion, steroids and other immunosuppressive medications are of limited value. Plasmapheresis along with anticoagulant therapy should be considered. ",0
"Clinical analyses and short-term prognoses of neonates with subependymal cysts. Twenty-one neonates with subependymal cysts detected by neurosonography soon after birth were prospectively examined. The clinical and cranial sonographic findings were evaluated with respect to short-term prognosis. The prognosis was poor in 6 patients with congenital viral infection (4 with cytomegalovirus infection and 2 with rubella infection). Five patients also had neurodevelopmental abnormalities (2 with neonatal epileptic seizures, 2 with chromosomal abnormalities, and 1 with lissencephaly). The remaining 10 patients had normal psychomotor development. The incidence of congenital viral infection was statistically correlated with a poor neurodevelopmental outcome. A correlation did not exist between the short-term prognosis and each of the other clinical factors or cranial sonographic findings. Our evidence suggests that further investigation of possible subependymal cyst etiologies is required during a careful, long-term follow-up period. ",0
"Systemic therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer. Fluorouracil-based chemotherapy regimens have been utilized in metastatic colorectal cancer for more than 30 years. Early attempts at defining an optimal treatment schedule and use in combination with other drugs failed to significantly improve results. In contrast, the clinical effectiveness of fluorouracil has been improved by continuous infusion administration and modulation with folinic acid. Both approaches have increased the response rate compared with results achieved with traditional bolus schedules; the effect on survival has been less significant. Unfortunately, expense and, in some instances, toxicity have also been increased, which detracts from their overall usefulness. Clinical studies that evaluate fluorouracil chemotherapy in combination with biological-response modifiers are ongoing and will be areas of intense research during the next few years. ",0
"Adenoidectomy in otitis media. A review. For many years adenoids were thought to affect adversely middle ear (ME) aeration by obstructing the eustachian tube opening, leading to ME infections and effusions. Consequently, the adenoids have often been removed in children suffering from ME diseases; indeed, adenoidectomy is still performed around the globe on millions of children annually. Opinions vary, however, on the usefulness of the operation in various ME diseases. The purpose of this study is to review the available studies concerning the relationship of adenoids to the ME as well as the effect and benefit of adenoidectomy on ME effusions and ME infections.

"Clinical cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful tool providing high-resolution images of the heart and great vessels without the use of ionizing radiation or contrast agents. MRI systems currently in use at many hospitals can be used effectively in the routine, clinical evaluation of many forms of cardiovascular disease, including great vessel disease, ischemic cardiac disease and congenital cardiac disease. Moreover, quantitative and cine MRI techniques are now available, which provide highly accurate measures of chamber size, wall motion and wall thickening. Recent developments in the areas of myocardial tagging, high-speed imaging and MR assessments of flow and perfusion suggest potential for an increasing role of MRI in the clinical evaluation of the cardiovascular system.

Embryonal carcinoma of the testis presenting as a left heart mass. A 31-year-old man with a history of intravenous drug abuse and tooth abscess was admitted for evaluation of possible infective endocarditis. Echocardiography showed that he had a left atrial mass. The mass removed from the left atrium had the same histology as the primary embryonal carcinoma discovered in the right testicle during hospitalization. The patient made a smooth recovery after surgical intervention and chemotherapy. This is believed to be the first reported case of metastasis from embryonal carcinoma of the testis to the left side of the heart that was successfully removed at surgery. ,0
"Relationship of clinical features with psychological status in primary fibromyalgia. Clinical features and psychological status determined by the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) in 103 patients with primary fibromyalgia syndrome (PFS) were analyzed by univariate and multivariate techniques to determine if clinical features were related to psychological status or were intrinsic to PFS per se. The central features of PFS, e.g., number of pain sites, number of tender points, fatigue, and poor sleep, were independent of psychological status. However, discriminant analysis identified 4 variables--patient-reported depression, anxiety, stress, and pain severity--which together predicted 3 MMPI subgroups with an accuracy of 55% (P less than 0.001); the only musculoskeletal feature--pain severity--alone provided an accuracy of only 34% (P greater than 0.05). These data suggest a new concept, that the central features of fibromyalgia are independent of the psychological status and are more likely related to the PFS itself. However, pain severity may be influenced by psychological factors. ",0
"Left ventricular remodeling after acute myocardial infarction: clinical course and beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. LV enlargement is an important determinant of survival after AMI. Pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to LV dilatation after an AMI include early thinning and stretching of the infarcted segment (e.g., infarct expansion) and hypertrophy of the noninfarcted myocardium. Such LV dilatation may adversely affect subsequent cardiac function, leading to heart failure and death. Experimental data in animals and preliminary studies in humans have demonstrated that early administration of captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, may limit infarct expansion and will attenuate progressive LV dilatation. This article discussed the clinical importance of the dilated left ventricle and reviewed advances and ongoing research in the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in the chronic phase after AMI.

"Aspergillus terreus endophthalmitis in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. A 65-year-old woman with a 7-year history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia presented with acute visual loss, pain, and redness in her right eye. Results of stains and cultures of anterior chamber fluid were negative. Neurologic problems, bronchopulmonary pneumonia, recurrent skin lesions, and a low-grade fever developed. Progressive respiratory distress ensued, and the patient died 1 month after presentation. Cultures from antemortem sputum and skin samples were positive for Aspergillus terreus. Postmortem histologic results showed extensive A terreus invasion of the posterior vitreous, retina, choroid, and anterior optic nerve. This organism was also found in histologic sections from the right adrenal gland, left kidney, thyroid, urinary bladder, right lung, skin, esophagus, sputum, vessels of the myocardium, and brain. To our knowledge, A terreus endophthalmitis has not been reported previously. ",0
"Patient profiling: individualization of hypertension therapy. Although the stepped-care approach remains the cornerstone of antihypertensive therapy, the patient's profile must also be considered. Important issues include the patient's age, race and activity level, potential for hypertensive complications, presence of other diseases, cost of medications and probability of adherence to the recommended drug regimen. Nonpharmacologic treatment based on lifestyle changes is a useful adjunct to drug therapy, but it is not sufficient to control hypertension in most patients. Selection of pharmacologic therapy must be based on a knowledge of each drug's mode of action and side effects, as well as the characteristics of special patient populations. ",0
"Inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver associated with acute myelomonocytic leukemia. A patient with inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver associated with acute myelomonocytic leukemia (M4) is reported. He had spiking fever, epigastralgia, and elevated levels of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Ultrasonography showed a hypoechoic mass in the liver, and ultrasonically guided fine needle aspiration biopsy of the mass revealed that it was composed of fibrous connective tissue infiltrated with plasma cells, eosinophils, and neutrophils. Accordingly, a diagnosis of inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver was made. Marked reduction in the size of the lesion and a decrease of the levels of the CRP and ALP occurred without specific treatment. We emphasize the importance of ultrasonically guided aspiration biopsy in diagnosis of inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver without the need for surgery. ",0
"Adipsic hypernatremia in two sisters. We describe two sisters with chronic hypernatremia, lack of thirst, and inappropriate osmoregulated vasopressin secretion. Only one sister, who presented with microcephaly and developmental delay, showed signs of dysplasia of the midline structures (ie, septum pellucidum and corpus callosum) and a large intracranial cyst. Neither sister showed any signs of thirst, even when osmolality exceeded 337 mmol/kg. In both patients, the vasopressin secretion did not respond to either osmotic or nonosmotic stimuli or was suppressed by a water load. Plasma osmolality values returned to normal after treatment with forced hydration and a vasopressin analogue, desamino-D-arginine vasopressin. These findings indicate a severe defect in the hypothalamic osmoreceptors that control thirst and vasopressin secretion. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such a disorder in two sisters.

"Window operation: an alternative treatment method for Bartholin gland cysts and abscesses Recently, we developed the ""window operation"" as a more effective way to treat Bartholin gland cysts and abscesses. The window operation was used to treat 25 Bartholin cysts and 22 Bartholin abscesses during a 3-year period from October 1, 1986 to September 30, 1989. Under local anesthesia, a small piece of skin including the cyst wall was excised in an oval shape, and suturing was performed along the excised margin. Postoperative antibiotics were given in cases of acute inflammation. A new mucocutaneous junction was observed at the 4-week postoperative checkup. No complications or recurrences have been observed during the study period. The window operation can be an alternative method of treatment for Bartholin gland cysts or abscesses. ",0
"Hemibody irradiation in advanced prostatic carcinoma. In summary, hemibody irradiation has developed as a safe, efficient technique for palliating multiple sites of symptomatic osseous metastases, which occur so often in advanced prostatic carcinoma. The rapidity, frequency, and duration of pain relief, as well as the convenience to the patient of a solitary treatment to multiple symptomatic areas simultaneously, make this type of treatment especially appealing. By following premedication and radiation dose guidelines, both acute and delayed side effects can be kept tolerable or at a minimal incidence. Although sequential hemibody radiation has also been explored as ""systemic"" therapy, the results in prostatic carcinoma have not proved dramatic, and complications have been considerable. Hormonal therapy would certainly seem to be less life-threatening and equally beneficial according to present data. As a palliative treatment, however, hemibody irradiation is a pragmatic option for relieving prostatic cancer pain. ",0
"The early diagnosis and treatment of developmental patella infera syndrome. Developmental patella infera and associated arthrofibrosis after knee surgery require prompt recognition and treatment. The condition develops because of contracture of peripatellar tissues, fatpad tissues, and quadriceps weakness, and may rapidly progress to permanent patella infera and disabling patellofemoral arthrosis. Case studies for five patients with acute developmental patella infera are described. All patients required an early arthroscopic release of contracted tissues. To establish normal right to left patellar, vertical-height ratios, lateral roentgenograms were obtained in 202 normal knees (101 pairs). The data showed that although essentially no difference existed between right and left sides, large variations existed in the ratios from one individual to another (range, 0.75-1.46). Thus, the diagnosis of developmental patella infera requires comparison of patellar height ratios in the same knee or between knees in the same individual. A decrease in the vertical-height ratio of 11%-15%, depending on the method used, indicates developmental patella infera. ",0
"Neuropsychological profile linked to low dopamine: in Alzheimer's disease, major depression, and Parkinson's disease. A distinct pattern of neuropsychological deficits was associated with low homovanillic acid (HVA) in the cerebrospinal fluid of 21 patients with: Alzheimer's disease (9), Parkinson's disease (8) and major depressive disorders (4). Regardless of clinical diagnosis, patients with low HVA were slower on a test of efficiency of processing timed information, and showed greater benefit from semantic structure on a verbal fluency task than patients with high HVA. However, low HVA subjects were not significantly impaired on confrontation naming (Boston Naming Test). Across three diagnostic groups, patients with lower HVA also tended to have more extrapyramidal motor signs and were significantly more depressed. These results demonstrate a significant relationship between specific neuro-behavioural deficits and dopaminergic activity which cuts across traditional diagnostic categories. ",0
"Impact of day care on dementia patients--costs, well-being and relatives' views. Forty-seven patients in psychogeriatric day centre were analysed regarding use of resources, costs and well-being. The level of well-being was based on interviews with staff and relatives and related to the economic outcome--a cost utility analysis. A 6 month period prior to day care was compared with the first 6 months in such care. The use of resources at home increased by 20% while the use of institutional care was reduced by 22%. Fifty-three percent of the patients improved in their well-being after participation in day care. When the cost of utility analysis was applied, the cost for a well-year was 4293 pounds. ",0
"Adult phosphorylase b kinase deficiency. Phosphorylase b kinase deficiency affecting muscle has been observed infrequently in children with weakness and hepatomegaly, and in 2 adults with cramps on exertion. We observed 2 additional adults with phosphorylase b kinase deficiency: Patient 1, aged 58, had progressive, predominantly distal weakness since age 46 but no cramps on exertion; Patient 2, aged 26, had cramps on exertion since age 6 but no weakness. Lactate production on ischemic exercise was impaired only in Patient 1. The serum creatine kinase level was elevated in both. Muscle specimens showed focal glycogen excess in both, and a necrotizing myopathy and mild denervation atrophy in Patient 1. Muscle phosphorylase b kinase activity was 0.5% and 8.9% of the lowest control value in Patients 1 and 2, respectively; erythrocyte phosphorylase b kinase activity was normal in both; liver phosphorylase b kinase activity, measured in Patient 1, was also normal. Other glycolytic enzymes in muscle were preserved in both. ",0
"Femoropopliteal angioplasty. Factors influencing long-term success. Prospective data was recorded on 217 percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) procedures performed in the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries over an 8-year period. After the initial procedure, patients were followed with serial noninvasive studies and, in 71 patients, repeat angiography. The mean follow-up period was 7 years (range, 2-11 years). Standard life-table survival analysis was used to assess the factors potentially affecting long-term outcome. Excluding an initial technical failure rate of 10%, overall patencies at 1, 3, and 5 years were 81%, 61%, and 58%, respectively. After the first year, the prognosis (i.e., failure rate) appears to be linear over the long term (i.e., up to 10 years). Factors negatively influencing long-term patency include the presence of diabetes mellitus, diffuse atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, or threatened limb loss. Technical factors correlated with failure include lesion length, moderate eccentricity, and a poor post-PTA appearance. ",0
"Isolated ventral pancreatitis in a patient with pancreas divisum. A previously healthy 22-yr-old woman was found to have chronic pancreatitis restricted to the ventral pancreas in association with pancreas divisum. When conservative treatment failed, sphincteroplasty of both papillae was performed with good results. This well-documented case represents a clear exception to the commonly held concept that obstruction of the dorsal duct is the essential pathogenic factor in the development of pancreatitis associated with pancreas divisum. The importance of visualizing both the dorsal and ventral pancreatic ducts to direct therapy for patients with idiopathic pancreatitis is discussed. Theories of the pathogenesis of concomitant pancreatitis and pancreas divisum are reviewed. ",0
The UCLA-University of Utah epidemiologic survey of autism: the etiologic role of rare diseases. Twelve rare diseases known to cause CNS pathology were found in 26 (11%) of 233 autistic probands identified during a recent epidemiologic survey of Utah. These 26 probands had significantly lower mean IQs than the remaining patients (43 versus 60) but similar sex distribution and prevalence of abnormal EEGs and seizures. The rarity and diversity of these 12 diseases make it highly unlikely that they randomly occurred with autism. Their presence in this epidemiologic survey is the most compelling evidence to date to support the hypothesis that different diseases producing different types of CNS pathology can play an etiologic role in autism. ,0
"Mechanism of intermittent preexcitation in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. The concept of electronically mediated conduction across an inexcitable gap. A man with intermittent preexcitation in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is reported. Once a sinus impulse was blocked in the accessory pathway, the block (ie, loss of preexcitation) was continued for a while until a PP interval reached or exceeded a critical period inducing sudden reappearance of preexcitation. This critical period was considerably longer than the effective refractory period of the accessory pathway. These findings are explained by the use of the concept of electronically mediated conduction across an inexcitable gap in the accessory pathway. It seems that when loss of protection was maintained, the sinus impulse was blocked at the site proximal to the gap, but the impulse passing through the atrioventricular node always reached retrogradely the site distal to the gap, and therefore, the next sinus impulse was blocked again.

"Multimodality cisplatin treatment in nonresectable alpha-fetoprotein-positive hepatoma. Twenty-eight patients with alpha-fetoprotein-positive (AFP+) nonresectable hepatoma have been enrolled in a new multimodality Phase I, II program. Induction therapy consisted of 50 mg/m2 intravenous cisplatin followed by 2100 cGy irradiation to the tumor volume in seven fractions over 10 days. Hepatic arterial infusion of 50 mg/m2 cisplatin (IA-CDDP) was then administered at monthly intervals. Twenty-one patients have completed induction and at least two cycles of IA-CDDP. Twelve-month cumulative survival was 52% for all 28 patients and 69% for the 21 patients completing induction and IA-CDDP. Median survival has not yet been reached. Response rate (complete and partial) was 36% overall and 48% among the 21 patients who completed treatment. The improved survival of the present series of patients as well as the minimal hematologic toxicity suggests possible further integration of new modalities for therapy. ",0
"Prevention and changing demographics. The underserved and cancer. This paper illustrates the complexity of the ""cancer control in the underserved"" problem, especially as it is affected currently, and will be in the future, by the multiple demographic changes in the United States. It does so by extensively quoting from four rather different articles by authors from a variety of backgrounds in health, management, and economics. Another issue is that although the articles quoted refer mainly to secondary and tertiary prevention, they do apply equally to primary prevention and health promotion. Furthermore, the twin issues of priority and ethnic/cultural differences need to be addressed insofar as they affect health risks, risk reduction efforts, early diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation/disability reduction. Finally, the point is made that social and structural change of this magnitude cannot occur in the health care system and society at large without the allocation of discrete private and public sector resources.

"Sclerotherapy for esophageal varices. Endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) frequently is used for patients with esophageal varices, both for controlling acute hemorrhage and for prophylaxis. An old technique, interest in EIS increased when other methods did not improve patient outcomes. Clinical trials of EIS for acute hemorrhage demonstrated efficacy and improved outcome, although some researchers disagree with these findings. Recent data on prophylaxis with EIS fail to support the value of EIS for this indication. Ethanolamine oleate compares favorably with other sclerosing agents, and is the only one currently approved for EIS. The intravariceal method is used more frequently than the paravariceal method because it has better efficacy and can be performed more rapidly. The percentage of patients developing significant complications from EIS may be as high as 15 percent; common complications include retrosternal pain, pyrexia, and sepsis. EIS is currently an important clinical tool in the management of esophageal varices. ",0
"Relative effects of brain and non-brain injuries on neuropsychological and psychosocial outcome. Based on the 242 consecutive surviving head injury cases and 132 general trauma cases, this study examined the contribution of brain and non-brain injuries to cognitive and psychosocial outcome 1 month postinjury. The study also examined the relationships among various head injury severity indices. The head injury severity indices were all correlated but patients with Glasgow Coma Scale scores in the mild range had broadly ranging scores on the other head injury severity indices (Abbreviated Injury Scale and time to follow commands). Neuropsychological outcome was related to brain injury severity, but was not independently influenced by severity of other systems injuries. Psychosocial outcome related to both brain and non-brain injuries independently. When evaluating trauma outcome, it is important to consider the contributions of both brain and other system injuries.

"Endoscopic retrograde brush cytology. A new technique. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography has been shown to be a very valuable adjunct in the diagnosis of malignancy involving the biliary and/or pancreatic ductal system. However, characteristic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography radiographic findings associated with malignant strictures are frequently not specific and cytological confirmation becomes essential for the diagnosis. Unfortunately, the current overall diagnostic yield of positive cytology in such circumstances ranges from 18%-56% depending on the technique. A new brush device has been designed which is uniquely adapted to pancreaticobiliary strictures of varying anatomical configurations. This study shows results using this new cytology brush in a series of 53 patients with pancreaticobiliary malignancy. A significant improvement in the cytological yield of tumor confirmation was obtained with a diagnostic sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 100% using the new brush technique. ",0
"The role of the iliolumbar ligament in the lumbosacral junction. The biomechanical function of the iliolumbar ligament in the human lumbosacral junction was investigated by analyzing the three-dimensional movements of the whole lumbar and lumbo-sacral-ilium specimens. The experiment was repeated in the following three conditions: 1) intact iliolumbar ligament, 2) right iliolumbar ligament transected, and 3) bilateral iliolumbar ligaments transected. The representative values of the increased motions, compared with intact, after transection of the bilateral iliolumbar ligaments were 1.7 degrees (23%) in flexion, 1.1 degrees (20%) in extension, 0.3 degrees (18%) in axial rotation, and 1.2 degrees (29%) in lateral bending. The most restricted motion governed by the iliolumbar ligament in the lumbosacral junction was lateral bending. The bilateral iliolumbar ligament specimen could restrict flexion and extension of the lumbosacral junction, but the unilateral iliolumbar ligament preparation alone could not restrict these motions. The iliolumbar ligament also had the function of restricting the rotational movement of the lumbosacral junction. ",0
"Epidemiology of acute respiratory tract infections among young children in Kenya. The epidemiology of acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) was investigated in a rural community 80 km north of Nairobi, Kenya. This research was conducted prospectively on 250 families with 470 children less than 5 years of age who were contacted every 8 days during the 3-year study. The yearly incidence of respiratory tract infections decreased from 5.2 to 3.4 during the study; less than 5% of these infections involved the lower respiratory tract. The incidence was inversely related to age, and the illnesses were generally mild and brief in length. Fifteen children died during the study period. The precise causes of death are unknown, but respiratory infections possibly played a role in most cases. This study emphasizes the importance of determining the risk factors responsible for unusually severe morbidity and high mortality in children with ARI in developing countries. ",0
Gastrointestinal intraluminal pH in normal subjects and those with colorectal adenoma or carcinoma. Recent evidence suggests that the production of colorectal carcinogens is facilitated when the pH of the colonic contents is alkaline. It follows that the colonic intraluminal pH of patients with colorectal neoplasms should be higher than in normal subjects. Gastrointestinal pH has been measured in 30 patients with colorectal cancer and 37 patients with benign colorectal adenomas (using a pH sensitive radiotelemetry capsule). These values have been compared with those recorded in 66 normal subjects. No differences in gastrointestinal pH were found and the results did not support the hypothesis that colonic pH plays a role in the aetiology of colorectal neoplasia. ,0
"Congenital cyst of common bile duct: an unusual cause of obstructive jaundice. Congenital cysts, sometimes referred to as nonparasitic biliary cysts, are not unusual findings in the liver parenchyma, but they have not been previously described in the common bile duct. This clinical report describes a 41-year-old woman with obstructive jaundice that was caused by congenital cysts. The patient had obstruction of the middle portion of the common bile duct; therefore the major differential diagnostic considerations were cholangiocarcinoma, cancer of the pancreas, or true biliary cysts. Congenital cysts, retention cysts, and neoplastic cysts cannot be differentiated from other true cysts preoperatively. Diagnosis can only be established by microscopic examination after surgical excision. ",0
"Mycobacterium chelonei keratopathy with visual rehabilitation by a triple procedure. We report a chronic keratouveitis following an eye injury, the etiology of which remained obscure despite repeated corneal scrapings and cultures. Eventually, the diagnosis was established by culturing Mycobacterium chelonei from a corneal biopsy specimen. Topical amikacin resolved active inflammation, but dense corneal scarring and a cataract remained. Visual rehabilitation was achieved through a combined penetrating keratoplasty, extracapsular cataract extraction, and intraocular lens implantation. This case illustrates that there should be a high index of suspicion of atypical mycobacteria when faced with any unusual keratitis, particularly following penetrating injuries and corneal grafts.

Radiology for cochlear implants. One fifth of patients selected for cochlear implants have such bony irregularities in the cochlear duct that full insertion of a multichannel electrode array is impossible. Three cases of cochlear deafness are presented where pre- and post-operative radiology played an important part in the management. Standard CT at 2 mm cuts is compared with ultra high resolution CT at 1 mm cuts. The pitfall of poor definition is that the inexperienced surgeon may find himself unexpectedly drilling out an obliterated cochlear duct. Sections 30 degrees caudal to Reid's infra orbito-meatal base line at 1 mm intervals give maximum information for minimum radiation. Plain films show the placement of individual platinum electrode contacts in relation to the spiral 'frequency map' of the cochlea. This is vital information for the audiologist who has to route specific frequencies to specific sites within the ear for a good hearing result. ,0
"Approach to the patient with genital ulcer disease. The three major diseases characterized by genital ulcers--genital herpes, syphilis, and chancroid--are common, with genital herpes being most common in industrialized countries and chancroid being most common in developing countries. One fourth to one half of patients with genital ulcers have no diagnosed cause for their illness despite diagnostic efforts. The bulk of these cases is probably constituted by one of the three diseases for which diagnostic tests are falsely negative. There is accumulating evidence that genital ulcers facilitate the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and they may also be markers of high-risk behavior for acquisition of HIV. Appropriate therapy of patients with genital ulcers (as well as their sexual partners) depends on accurate diagnosis. Patients with genital ulcers, particularly those with syphilis or chancroid, should be encouraged to undergo testing for HIV infection. ",0
Coracoclavicular screw fixation for unstable fractures of the distal clavicle. A report of five cases. Five consecutive unstable fractures of the distal third of the clavicle were treated by indirect open reduction and internal fixation using a temporary Bosworth-type screw. Coracoclavicular fixation provided and maintained reduction of the fracture. Healing occurred uneventfully within nine weeks in all cases. The screw was removed under local anaesthesia after healing of the fracture and there were no surgical complications. Shoulder function was restored to the pre-injury level. Temporary coracoclavicular screw fixation appears to be a valuable alternative for the treatment of type II fractures of the distal third of the clavicle. ,0
"Chordoma: a 20-year clinicopathologic review of the experience at Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town. Eighteen chordomas (11 females and 7 males) were seen over a 20-year period; 61% of the tumors occurred in the sphenoid region. The youngest patient was 3 years old and had a family history of chordoma. Histologically, the tumors were divided into classical (epithelial) and chondroid variants, which in this series, had no effect on outcome. Follow-up on 12 patients ranged from 3 to 170 months, and they were treated with various combinations of surgery and radiotherapy. One patient was administered the neutron beam and died after 94 months. The mean survival of this series is 73.4 months, with a survival rate of 50% (6 out of 12 patients alive). Surgical resection offers the best chance of survival, but chordomas have a propensity to metastasize, hence have a poor prognosis. ",0
"Nasopalatine duct cyst: an analysis of 334 cases. The nasopalatine duct cyst (NPDC) is the most common cyst of nonodontogenic origin in the maxilla. However, the information reported about this lesion consists primarily of small surveys and isolated case reports. The purpose of this retrospective investigation was to gather demographic, clinical, and histologic data on a large series of NPDCs, and to compare the findings with those of previous studies. In this study, the overall mean age at diagnosis was 42.5 years, and there was a slight male predilection. The mean radiographic diameter was 17.1 mm, but 75% of the lesions were 20 mm or less in diameter. Symptoms were present in at least 70% of the cases. Only 28% of the specimens contained respiratory epithelium. There was no correlation between radiographic size, patient's age, presenting symptoms, or type of epithelium. Recurrence was noted in only 2% of the cases. ",0
"Factors associated with binocular single vision in microtropia/monofixation syndrome. We reviewed the charts of 398 patients with microtropia/monofixation syndrome to determine what factors influence the level of binocularity attained. Most patients (82%) exhibited some degree of stereoacuity. Patients with a later age at presentation of the initial deviation were more likely to exhibit stereoacuity (p less than 0.001). Patients with smaller initial deviations were also more likely to exhibit stereoacuity (p = 0.016), as were those with smaller manifest deviations on final testing (p less than 0.001). Patients with amblyopia on final testing were less likely to demonstrate stereoacuity (p = 0.0001). Generally, the more intervention required in the form of optical or surgical correction, the poorer the level of binocularity. ",0
"Short-term radiotherapy as palliative treatment in patients with transitional cell bladder cancer. We report the results and complications of treatment with palliative, short-term radiotherapy in 162 elderly or disabled patients. Improvement in tumour-associated symptoms was noted in 75 of these patients and 72 survived for more than a year. Those who responded to radiotherapy had a 5-year cancer-free survival rate of 58% compared with 4% in patients who did not respond to treatment. Survival was also affected by stage and indications for radiotherapy. In 85 patients without severe symptoms, where the tumour was judged curable but the patient was unsuitable for a full course of radiotherapy, the 5-year cancer-free survival rate was 21%, which is in accordance with what can be achieved with full-course radiotherapy; 42% had various minor acute side effects. The 5-year late complication rate was 7%. ",0
"Immunohistochemical study of erythropoietin in cerebellar hemangioblastomas associated with secondary polycythemia. Although cerebellar hemangioblastomas are known to be associated with secondary polycythemia, the cellular derivation of erythropoietin (EPO) in hemangioblastomas still remains obscure. Specimens from 18 patients with cerebellar hemangioblastomas were immunohistochemically studied using anti-EPO monoclonal antibody. Eight cases of brain tumors, including 2 meningiomas, 2 medulloblastomas, 2 glioblastomas, and 2 metastatic brain tumors were studied as controls. In 9 of 18 cases, EPO-positive cells were scattered around the capillaries and were ultrastructurally shown to be mast cells. These cases were not, however, associated with secondary polycythemia. In contrast, the stromal cells were positive for EPO in 3 cases. Among them, one was associated with secondary polycythemia. Furthermore, one-half of the control cases of brain tumor contained EPO-positive mast cells. Accordingly, it was suggested that mast cells (or small granulocytes) have little relationship to the release of EPO; however, some stromal cells might release EPO with a resultant polycythemia. ",0
"Right-to-left shunting through a patent foramen ovale caused by pulmonary hypertension associated with rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren's syndrome: a case report. This case report presents a fifty-four-year-old woman with right-to-left shunt in the atrium. It seemed clinically at first that the shunt was due to atrial septal defect. However, she also had pulmonary disease associated with rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren's syndrome. At autopsy atrial septal defect was not evident, but a patent foramen ovale and pulmonary artery disease were observed. This case suggests that pulmonary hypertension secondary to rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren's syndrome could lead to right-to-left shunting through a patent foramen ovale. ",0
"Predicting treatment outcome in nocturnal enuresis. A presenting sample of 127 consecutive referrals to a community based enuresis clinic were evaluated after treatment with baseline behavioural recording and the enuresis alarm. Almost one in five became dry after baseline recording only while 81 of 96 (84%) enuretics who used the alarm achieved the initial dryness criterion. Successful outcome was associated with the absence of adverse environmental factors and psychiatric disorders in the child. A logistic regression procedure enabled a risk score to be created so that successful outcome could be predicted. Psychiatric disorder in the child, family stress, and the degree of concern shown by the child emerged as the most important prognostic factors in the treatment of enuresis. The favourable success rates with baseline recording and the enuresis alarm confirm the role of conditioning treatment at the forefront of management of enuresis and the risk score allows outcome to be predicted for the first time.

"Cauda equina syndrome after continuous spinal anesthesia. Four cases of cauda equina syndrome occurring after continuous spinal anesthesia are reported. In all four cases, there was evidence of a focal sensory block and, to achieve adequate analgesia, a dose of local anesthetic was given that was greater than that usually administered with a single-injection technique. We postulate that the combination of maldistribution and a relatively high dose of local anesthetic resulted in neurotoxic injury. Suggestions that may reduce the potential for neurotoxicity are discussed. Use of a lower concentration and a ""ceiling"" or maximum dose of local anesthetic to establish the block should be considered. If maldistribution of local anesthetic is suspected (as indicated by a focal sensory block), the use of maneuvers to increase the spread of local anesthetic is recommended. If such maneuvers prove unsuccessful, the technique should be abandoned. ",0
"Chondrosarcoma of bone in children. Chondrosarcoma of bone rarely occurs in children. This report analyzes the clinicopathologic features in a series of 47 patients with conventional chondrosarcoma who were less than 17 years of age. Of the 47 cases, 14 were from the Mayo Clinic files, and 33 were from our consultation files. Most of the lesions occurred in the trunk and upper ends of the long bones, with the humerus being the most frequent skeletal site. Twelve of the 47 tumors were secondary. The radiographic findings were the same as those seen in adult chondrosarcoma. Pathologically, the tumors were low grade. En bloc resection is the treatment of choice because of the high incidence of local recurrence with lesser surgical margins. Prognosis in childhood chondrosarcoma is no different from that in adult chondrosarcoma. None of the patients with follow-up data had metastasis. ",0
"Glucagonoma syndrome is an underdiagnosed clinical entity. Glucagonomas, considered among the rarest of the islet cell neoplasms, produce a well-defined clinical syndrome characterized by necrolytic migratory erythema, diabetes mellitus, glossitis, anemia, and weight loss. This report describes seven patients with glucagonoma treated at our institution. All seven had the characteristic dermatologic manifestations, present from 1 to 6 years prior to diagnosis. Five patients had extensive disease at the time of initial operation, three of whom underwent aggressive cytoreductive surgery, whereas the other two had biopsy only. The remaining two patients presented with a single nodule each, underwent distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy, and remain free of disease 2 and 6 years postoperatively. Earlier recognition of the distinctive physical findings peculiar to this syndrome should increase survival. Aggressive cytoreductive surgery results in prolonged remission. ",0
"Hepatic giant cavernous hemangioma with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and consumption coagulopathy. We describe a case of hepatic giant cavernous hemangioma with both microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) and consumption coagulopathy, but without thrombocytopenia, which was completely cured by surgical resection of the tumor. The patient was a 54-yr-old Japanese woman whose chief complaint was right upper abdominal discomfort. Angiography and dynamic computed tomography revealed typical findings of hepatic cavernous hemangioma. The patient also had hematological disorders. At surgery, we performed an atypical right lobectomy to preserve as much normal liver tissue as possible. The patient has been well, with no related complaints or abnormal laboratory findings, 5 yr since her operation. This case indicates that giant cavernous hemangioma of the liver should be considered in the differential diagnosis of MAHA, and if surgical treatment is adequate, hematological abnormalities may be eliminated.

"Diagnosis of oral hairy leukoplakia by ultrastructural examination of exfoliative cytologic specimens. Lingual exfoliative cytologic specimens (scrapings) were obtained from 18 patients positive for human immunodeficiency virus with clinical oral hairy leukoplakia. Buccal mucosal scrapings were obtained from 12 of these patients. The specimens were processed for examination by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Sixteen (89%) of the lingual specimens revealed infection of keratinocytes by herpes-type virus. There was no evidence of virus infection in the 12 buccal mucosal scrapings. Fungal hyphae were seen by TEM in 14 (78%) of the lingual scrapings and two (17%) of the buccal scrapings. One exfoliative specimen and two biopsy specimens were stained for Epstein-Barr virus DNA with a DNA probe. The demonstration of herpes-type virions by TEM in keratinocytes from a lesion clinically suspected to be hairy leukoplakia provides direct, objective diagnosis. Furthermore, use of exfoliative cytologic specimens provides a clinically simple, noninvasive technique. ",0
"Urinary tract re-functionalization after long-term diversion. A 20-year experience with 177 patients. From 1969 to 1990, previously diverted urinary tracts were 'undiverted' in 177 patients whose ages ranged from 1 to 31 years. Fifty-six of the patients (32%) had been diverted for 10 years or longer. There were 67 female and 110 male patients. Forty-four patients had only one kidney and in two of those patients it was a previous renal transplant. One patient was anephric at the time of reconstruction, having had two unsuccessful transplants. Most of the diversions had been considered permanent. Types of diversions that were reversed include ileal loop, colon conduit, loop ureterostomy or pyelostomy, end ureterostomy, cystostomy or vesicostomy, long-term nephrostomy, and ureterosigmoidostomy.

"Muscle relaxation rates in individuals susceptible to malignant hyperthermia. Muscle relaxation rate following a tetanic stimulus of adductor pollicis muscle was measured prospectively in 26 patients potentially susceptible to malignant hyperthermia (MH) the day before a muscle biopsy was obtained for MH in vitro screening. Eleven subjects were found to be MH susceptible (MHS) and 15 subjects MH-negative (MHN). In all patients, relaxation rate was recorded at three different temperatures of the skin overlying adductor pollicis (30, 34 and 38 degrees C) achieved by a small surface heating unit placed over the thenar eminence. The MHS group exhibited slightly higher relaxation rate at 34 and 38 degrees C compared with the MHN group and this difference was accentuated with increasing temperature, but was not statistically different. The results of the present study suggest that relaxation rates are normal in MHS individuals under physiological conditions and cannot be used diagnostically for MH screening. ",0
"Increased serum beta 2-microglobulin concentrations in hyperthyroid states. Serum beta 2-microglobulin concentrations were determined in 21 untreated hyperthyroid patients (12 with Graves' disease, and nine with toxic nodular adenoma) and in 20 healthy controls. All subjects had normal serum creatinine concentrations and urine analysis. Both total and free thyroid hormones were significantly higher in the hyperthyroid groups than in controls. Beta 2-microglobulin concentrations were significantly increased in both groups of hyperthyroid patients compared with controls. No difference was found in the thyroid hormone and beta 2-microglobulin concentrations between both sets of patients. The beta 2-microglobulin and thyroid hormone concentrations were not correlated. These data show that hyperthyroidism is another cause of increased beta 2-microglobulin production along with viral infections, immunologically mediated diseases, and malignant neoplasms. The increased serum beta 2-microglobulin concentration in thyroid hyperfunction is probably related to metabolic rate, even if autoimmunity might contribute to its overproduction. ",0
"Esophageal motility, heartburn, and gastroesophageal reflux: variations in clinical presentation of esophageal dysphagia. Dysphagia is a potentially important symptom, often leading to the finding of an anatomical or motility disorder of the esophagus. Dysphagia and heartburn represent two of the most common symptoms associated with esophageal motility disorders. To explore the relationship of symptomatic esophageal dysphagia and heartburn and their association with primary esophageal motor disorders, we have performed a retrospective assessment of 1035 patient evaluations performed at our gastrointestinal laboratory. A clear statistical association of symptomatic dysphagia and heartburn was established; however, no pattern diagnostic of a specific motility disorder was discernible. A sizable fraction of our patient population with dysphagia demonstrated normal esophageal motility. A significant portion of dyspeptic patients exhibited both normal motility and acid exposure. The differences observed between the incidence of subjective symptoms and objective dysfunction may be explained in part by an altered or increased esophageal sensitivity of these patients. ",0
"Pseudotumor of the craniocervical junction during long-term hemodialysis. A systematic study of the upper cervical spine was performed using magnetic resonance imaging in 25 patients (15 men and 10 women) who had been undergoing hemodialysis for more than 10 years. Seven pseudotumors of the periodontoid soft tissue were disclosed, which were similar to the pannus recently described in rheumatoid arthritis. Bone cystic radiolucencies were observed in association with these pseudotumors in 5 patients. The radiolucencies were located in the atlas (1 in the lateral mass and 1 in the anterior branch) and in the axis (3 in the odontoid process and 1 in the vertebral body). No horizontal or vertical atlantoaxial subluxation was demonstrated. These features were observed only in patients who had amyloid arthropathy. They could be a frequent, yet thus far little-recognized, feature of beta 2-microglobulin amyloidosis. ",0
"Fungal brain abscesses (aspergillosis/mucormycosis) in two immunosuppressed patients. Although the mortality rate for fungal brain abscesses in immunosuppressed patients remains unacceptably high, this figure may be reduced if computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans are performed more promptly in susceptible individuals with seemingly mild intracranial complaints. Earlier presumptive amphotericin B treatment and more timely surgical debridement may minimize neurological injury and enhance survival. These assumptions were only tentatively supported by the clinical courses of two patients, one an alert patient with promyelocytic leukemia and an aspergillosis brain abscess who survived, and the other, a comatose intravenous drug abuser with mucormycosis who died.

"Rigid fixation of internal orbital fractures. When large portions of the internal orbit are destroyed (two to four walls), standard bone-grafting techniques for immediate and late orbital reconstruction may not yield predictable eye position. Critical bone support is most often deficient inferomedially. CT analysis of orbital volume in cases where eye position was unsatisfactory reveals that displacement of bone grafts is one mechanism of the unsatisfactory result. Other mechanisms include undercorrection and bone-graft resorption. In order to minimize postoperative bone-graft displacement, titanium implants were used to span large defects in the internal orbit to provide a platform for bone-graft support. Twenty-six implants were placed in immediate and 12 were placed in late orbital reconstructions. More reliable bone-graft position resulted. Two late infections have occurred resulting in implant removal in a 3-year period. ",0
"Oral labetalol in hypertensive urgencies. The response to incremental doses of oral labetalol in 16 patients with hypertensive urgencies is presented. After inadequate blood pressure control with 20 mg of intravenous furosemide, each patient received a 300 mg oral dose of labetalol. Subsequent oral doses of labetalol, 100 mg, were administered at 2-hour intervals, if the diastolic blood pressure remained greater than 100 mm Hg. The maximum dose of labetalol per patient was 500 mg. Five patients required only the initial 300 mg dose of labetalol. Two patients required further therapy for satisfactory blood pressure control. Mean arterial pressure fell from 156 +/- 12 mm Hg to 123 +/- 14 mm Hg. ",0
"Lack of association between keratoconus, mitral valve prolapse, and joint hypermobility. The authors enrolled 95 patients with keratoconus and 96 matched controls in a cross-sectional study to determine if mitral valve prolapse and hypermobile joints occur with greater frequency in individuals with keratoconus than in individuals without keratoconus. The hypothesis that keratoconus may not be a distinct eye disease, but a nonspecific sign representing a more generalized systemic disorder, possibly a mild collagen tissue abnormality, was considered. M-mode and two dimensional echocardiography and cardiac auscultation detected no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of mitral valve prolapse in patients with keratoconus compared with controls. Formal, systematic examination of five joints also failed to detect a statistically significant difference in the prevalence of hypermobile joints in keratoconus patients and controls. However, as an ancillary finding, a significantly higher proportion of patients with keratoconus was found to have a history of hay fever than was the case with controls. ",0
"A rapid, effective technique for retrograde crossing of valvular aortic stenosis using standard coronary catheters Retrograde crossing of valvular aortic stenosis can be challenging even to experienced angiographers. In 446 of 447 consecutive patients with aortic stenosis catheterized during the past 3 years, a technique using a standard Judkins right coronary catheter and a floppy straight tipped guide wire was successful in rapidly and efficiently crossing these pathologically distorted valves in retrograde fashion. Once the valve was crossed, the coronary catheter was replaced with a pigtail catheter for pressure and ventriculography. The majority of these valves required less than 2 min to cross using this technique. This method is valuable in limiting the time required for catheterization, thus helping to reduce procedure related morbidity in these oftimes critically ill patients. ",0
"Prochlorperazine and transdermal scopolamine added to a metoclopramide antiemetic regimen. A controlled comparison. Cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting occurs both acutely and over a prolonged period of time. These symptoms may be incapacitating and are frequently given as a reason to discontinue therapy. We compared prochlorperazine and transdermal scopolamine when added to a standardized metoclopramide antiemetic regimen. Twenty-seven patients receiving cisplatin at 100 mg/m2 were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment arms. Patients were observed during chemotherapy and answered a standard questionnaire 24-26 hours later. Among similar treatment groups no differences were seen regarding the number of emetic events, level of nausea, degree of sedation or overall acceptability of one treatment arm or another. While not superior to prochlorperazine, transdermal scopolamine is a useful antiemetic agent and can be combined with metoclopramide in an attempt to reduce cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting. Further evaluation of this approach is needed. ",0
"Homeobox gene expression plus autocrine growth factor production elicits myeloid leukemia. In the murine myelomonocytic leukemia WEHI-3B, proviral insertions have induced expression of the Hox-2.4 homeobox gene and the gene for the myeloid growth factor interleukin 3 (IL-3). To assess their potential oncogenic role, normal bone marrow cells were infected with retroviruses bearing the genes for IL-3 or IL-3 plus Hox-2.4. Unlike the IL-3 virus, the IL-3/Hox-2.4 virus was highly leukemogenic. Infected cells expressing both genes exhibited retarded differentiation in vitro, generated myelomonocytic cell lines, and provoked a rapid, transplantable myeloid leukemia in vivo. The oncogenic action of Hox-2.4 appears to derive from its ability to impede the IL-3-driven terminal differentiation of myeloid cells. The results suggest that homeobox genes can regulate key differentiation processes such as self-renewal capacity and that their inappropriate expression can be oncogenic. ",0
"Repetitive intraoperative mapping and cryotherapy improve the results of endocardial resection for ventricular tachycardia. Patients with recurrent ventricular tachycardia or a history of a sudden cardiac death episode and ventricular tachycardia inducible in the electrophysiology laboratory have a high incidence of recurrence and a high mortality despite medical therapy. Map-guided endocardial resection has improved treatment results, but is associated with a 10-30% failure rate. In our initial experience with endocardial resection (Group I) we incurred a 30% treatment failure rate. In the present study we have found the addition of sequential intraoperative mapping and routine use of cryotherapy (Group II) improved our results of ventricular tachycardia control without significant additional morbidity or mortality.

"Vascular entrapment of intra-aortic balloon after short-term balloon counterpulsation. Prolonged, continuous intra-aortic balloon (IAB) counterpulsation for several weeks can result in balloon entrapment secondary to thrombus formation in the balloon lumen. In this report, we describe a patient who developed IAB entrapment, early (1 wk) after initiation of counterpulsation. A trace amount of blood was noted in the tubing connecting the balloon catheter to the console for 3 days prior to IAB malfunction and vascular entrapment. We suggest that the balloon catheter be removed immediately when blood is detected in the external connecting tubing even if the IAB is functioning satisfactorily. ",0
"Pancreatic ascites presenting in infancy, with review of the literature. We report a 4-month-old boy with massive ascites in whom a diagnosis of pancreatitis was made on a raised ascitic amylase level after two inconclusive laparotomies. He developed a pseudocyst which was managed with repeated percutaneous needle aspirations, nutrition being maintained intravenously. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) demonstrated a congenital intra-pancreatic cyst. He thrived after operation drainage for recurrent pseudocyst, but repeat ERCP shows that the cyst in the head of the pancreas remains. Pancreatic ascites is rare in children and diagnosis is frequently delayed. A third of reported cases in childhood present in the first year of life. A search for the underlying cause should include an ERCP to demonstrate abnormalities of the pancreaticobiliary ducts. ",0
"Localization of calcitonin gene-related peptide in human esophageal Langerhans cells. Previously undescribed calcitonin gene-related peptide-immunoreactive intraepithelial cells were seen in specimens of esophageal mucosa obtained by biopsy or surgical resection from 14 individuals. These calcitonin gene-related peptide-immunoreactive cells were sparsely seen in normal mucosa but increased markedly in esophagitis. They were inaccessible to routine histological stains, but osmication showed them as dendritic forms resembling Langerhans cells of the skin. Their cytological identity was determined with immunocytochemical tests for human antigenic markers such as Ia, HLA-DR, and OKT6 for Langerhans cells, Leu-M5 and Leu-M3 for intraepithelial macrophages, CD3 and TCR-1 for T-lymphocytes, Leu-14 for B-lymphocytes, S-100 for Merkel cells, and chromogranin for amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation cells. Double localization showed that calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactivity colocalized with Ia, HLA-DR, and OKT6 but not with the other markers. These studies show that intraepithelial Langerhans cells in the esophageal mucosa contain calcitonin gene-related peptide, which may serve as an immunomodulator. ",0
"Death and functional outcome after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. A prospective study of 166 cases using multivariate analysis Using death and functional status as end points, we prospectively analyzed the outcome 6 months after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage in 166 patients admitted to an acute-care stroke unit on the first day of their stroke. Seventy-one patients (43%) died, 69 (42%) had a satisfactory outcome, and 26 (16%) had a poor functional outcome. Early (30-day) survival was correlated with morphologic parameters on the initial computed tomogram (hemorrhage size, midline shift, and intraventricular spread of the hemorrhage), while later (6-month) survival was correlated with age. Using logistic regression, we found five independent predictors of satisfactory outcome at 6 months: age, hemorrhage size, intraventricular spread of the hemorrhage, limb paresis, and communication disorders. Of these, age was the most important predictor by far. ",0
"Hypercalcemia with excess serum 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D in lymphomatoid granulomatosis/angiocentric lymphoma. Hypercalcemia has been described in a variety of granulomatous and lymphoproliferative disorders in association with elevated serum levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. In such cases, hypercalcemia appears to be the consequence of excessive production of 1,25(OH)2D by the lymphocyte/macrophage line. The authors report a patient with lymphomatoid granulomatosis/angiocentric lymphoma who developed hypercalcemia with extreme elevation in serum 1,25(OH)2D. Therapy with steroids reduced the serum calcium and 1,25(OH)2D levels to normal. Hypercalcemia has not previously been reported in lymphomatoid granulomatosis/angiocentric lymphoma. The distinctive features of this malignancy, and the derangement in the metabolism of 1,25(OH)2D in lymphoproliferative disorders in general, are discussed. ",0
"Meningeal involvement in Bence Jones multiple myeloma. A case of Bence Jones kappa multiple myeloma with meningeal involvement in a 64-year-old woman is presented. Three years after the diagnosis of multiple myeloma, gait disturbances developed followed by visual disorders and impaired consciousness. A lumbar puncture revealed numerous atypical plasma cells in the cerebrospinal fluid. Craniospinal irradiation and intrathecal injections of methotrexate, cytarabine, and prednisolone were effective for a short period. At autopsy, the leptomeninges were infiltrated diffusely with atypical plasma cells. A review of the literature showed that multiple myeloma with meningeal involvement is accompanied frequently by circulating atypical plasma cells or plasma cell leukemia. Meningeal involvement is a rare complication and shows poor prognosis in cases of multiple myeloma. ",0
"Spinal cord decompression via a modified costotransversectomy approach combined with posterior instrumentation for management of metastatic neoplasms of the thoracic spine. Fifteen patients with thoracic spinal cord compression from metastatic neoplastic processes were managed by spinal canal decompression via a modified costotransversectomy approach. Ten of the patients also underwent sequential posterior stabilization with Luque or Harrington instrumentation based upon proximity of the lesion to the thoracolumbar junction, prognosis for regaining or maintaining ambulatory ability, and additional spinal stability considerations. A modified lateral decubitus position with the scapula falling away from the side of exposure was used for T1-5 segment lesions, and a prone position was used for the (T-6)-(T-12) segment. Adequate decompression of the spinal canal was achieved in all cases. All patients who were ambulating preoperatively maintained ambulatory ability, and pain and/or further neurological improvement as well occurred in 75%. ",0
"Vertical partial laryngectomy: a critical analysis of local recurrence. The purpose of this study was to evaluate local recurrence following vertical partial laryngectomies in 416 patients with either T1N0M0 or T2N0M0 glottic carcinoma. Local failure was reported according to the T stage, the precise tumor location within each stage, the true vocal cord mobility, and the surgical procedure performed. No local recurrences were observed among 42 patients who underwent thyrotomy and cordectomy when the tumor was confined to the middle third of the mobile true vocal cord. Local failure occurred in 8 of 111 (7.2%) patients in whom hemilaryngectomy was performed for tumors confined to one mobile true vocal cord. There was a diverse group of lesions within each T stage that responded differently to the surgical approaches. The differences in the initial recurrence rates are discussed in terms of careful preoperative assessment and choice of surgical technique for early glottic carcinoma. ",0
"Growth abnormalities in children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Growth abnormalities in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis can be divided into two groups: local and systemic. Local disorders of growth often result in increased bone length and bone age or in marked decreases in longitudinal growth due to immobilization, premature epiphyseal closure, or fusion. Common growth defects seen in the knee, hand, wrist, hip, spine, and jaw are discussed. Systemic growth delay is most commonly secondary to active disease or treatment with corticosteroids. Nutritional aspects such as decreased appetite, reduced caloric intake, metabolic caloric requirements greater than available intake, or lack of essential vitamins could be the cause for decreased weight and stature.

"Complications of nasotracheal intubation in neonates, infants and children: a review of 4 years' experience in a children's hospital. A computerized database was set up to study the incidence and outcome of complications of nasotracheal intubation in a paediatric hospital. We studied 2953 intensive care admissions over a 4-yr period. The overall complication rate was 8%. Accidental extubation and tube blockage were the most frequent events, accounting for a mean of 3.5% and 2.6% of the complications per year, respectively. Complications were more common in smaller children and there were differences between fields of intensive care. None of the complications was fatal or resulted in serious sequelae. None of the children in the study showed clinical symptoms of acquired subglottic stenosis before discharge from hospital, and none has been readmitted for this condition subsequently. ",0
"Fusiform dilatations of the carotid artery following radical surgery of childhood craniopharyngiomas. Between 1982 and 1990, a series of 31 children with craniopharyngiomas underwent initial surgery at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia with an attempt at total tumor removal. Nine (29%) of them were found to have fusiform dilatation of the supraclinoid carotid artery either at the time of surgery for recurrence (one patient) or on routine surveillance with enhanced computerized tomography 6 to 18 months postoperatively (eight patients). The finding of carotid enlargement was confirmed in seven cases with magnetic resonance angiography and in one case with a formal arteriogram. Eight of the nine patients remain alive at a mean of 3.7 years after diagnosis. None have experienced hemorrhage or other symptoms referrable to fusiform dilatation of the carotid artery, which is believed to result from surgical manipulation of the carotid artery. ",0
"Cholesterol cysts of the temporal bone: diagnosis and treatment. Cholesterol cyst (or granuloma) of the temporal bone, a recognized clinical entity distinct from cholesteatoma, is more common than previously thought. Apparently it is caused by obstruction of previously pneumatized temporal bone air cells. Surgical cure is achieved by drainage and reestablishment of normal pneumatization. This paper reviews 14 cholesterol cysts of the temporal bone, emphasizing the importance of preoperative imaging and surgical approach. Use of magnetic resonance imaging differentiates cholesterol cysts from cholesteatoma or other neoplasms. Computed tomography delineates the location of the lesion and defines temporal bone anatomy essential to surgical approach. The two studies together allow the surgeon to properly plan drainage, as in the case of a cholesterol cyst, versus excision or exteriorization, as in the case of cholesteatoma. The infralabyrinthine approach to a petrous apex cholesterol cyst is the procedure of choice when hearing preservation is desired. ",0
"Acute porphyria presenting with hyperamylasemia. An elevation of serum amylase and lipase has not been reported previously to occur with porphyria. In this report, we describe a patient who presented with the clinical and laboratory picture of pancreatitis: elevated amylase, lipase, amylase-creatinine clearance ratio, and with abdominal pain. Only after extensive evaluation, was the patient found to have porphyria. On two separate occasions, with hematin therapy, her serum amylase decreased, as did her clinical symptoms of porphyria and her urinary quantitative porphyrins. This suggests an association between elevation of the serum amylase and lipase with acute porphyria. Moreover, this association can lead to delay in establishing the diagnosis of acute porphyria. ",0
"Delayed hearing loss after neurovascular decompression. We report two unusual cases of delayed hearing loss after neurovascular decompression of structures within the cerebellopontine angle. In the first case, the patient noted a unilateral hearing loss 3 weeks after undergoing vascular decompression of the trigeminal nerve for tic douloureux. This gradually improved over an 18-month period. In the second case, the patient awoke on the 4th day after vascular decompression of the facial nerve for hemifacial spasm with a bilateral hearing loss that has remained unchanged after the onset. These are examples of delayed acoustic dysfunction occurring with a shift in surgically freed vessels and may have been induced by newly directed neurovascular compression or distortion. ",0
"Long term follow-up of descending thoracic aorto-iliac/femoral bypass. A prospective study of 26 patients undergoing descending thoracic aorto-iliac/femoral (DTAI/F) bypass was conducted over a 13-year period with an average follow up of 53 months. Reasons for selecting the procedure were occluded aortic bifurcation grafts (9 patients), hostile abdomen (6), infected aortic graft (1), microaorta (10, and surgeons preference in 8 patients who had juxtarenal aortic occlusion. The operative mortality was 3.8% (1 patient). A late mortality of 36% was due to myocardial infarction (1), lung carcinoma (2), renal failure (4), stroke (1) and pulmonary insufficiency (1). Graft failure occurred in 4 patients at 23, 26, 54 and 109 months respectively. Primary cumulative patency was 86% statistically valid at 42 months. DTAI/F bypass is recommended in selected patients when conventional approaches to the aorta are considered unduly hazardous. ",0
"Comparative clinical pharmacology of calcium channel blockers. Calcium channel blockers are effective antihypertensive agents, both as initial monotherapy and in combination with other antihypertensive agents. These drugs are also effective in the treatment of chronic, stable angina, variant angina and supraventricular arrhythmias. Drugs in this class have different affinities for calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, cardiac sinus and atrioventricular node. They are all useful in hypertension and angina, but only verapamil and diltiazem are also useful in the control of heart rate and supraventricular arrhythmias. Nimodipine may control vascular spasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage. Calcium channel blockers have also been used in the treatment of migraine headache and Raynaud's phenomenon. ",0
"Intercostal arteriovenous fistula due to pleural biopsy A 32 year old woman had a pleural biopsy for a left pleural effusion, which showed caseating granuloma typical of tuberculosis. When the fourth biopsy specimen was removed considerable bleeding occurred from the puncture site. Four days later a bruit was audible over the punctured area, radiating to the back. Eight days after the procedure the patient had a massive bleed into the left pleural space. Selective aortic angiography showed an arteriovenous fistula between the 9th intercostal artery and vein and a pseudoaneurysm in the intercostal punctured area. Thoracotomy showed bleeding from the site of the pleural biopsy. The intercostal vessels were ligated and pleural decortication was performed, and the patient recovered uneventfully. ",0
"Ultrasonographic detection of the second-trimester fetus with trisomy 18 and trisomy 21. Biparietal diameter/femur length ratio and nuchal thickness were found to be sensitive indicators for the prenatal detection of trisomy 18 and trisomy 21. A biparietal diameter/femur length ratio greater than 1.5 SD above the control mean correctly identified 5 of 11 (46%) fetuses with trisomy 21 and 3 of 4 (75%) fetuses with trisomy 18. Nuchal thickening (6 mm or more) correctly identified 5 of 12 (41%) fetuses with trisomy 21 and 2 of 4 (50%) fetuses with trisomy 18. The sensitivity and specificity of the biparietal diameter/femur length ratio in detecting either aneuploidy was 53% and 93%, respectively, whereas a thickened nuchal fold had a sensitivity of 44% and a specificity of 100%. The combined use of the two ultrasonographic measurements had an overall sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 93%. Prospective ascertainment of these two trisomies appears warranted in low-risk populations. ",0
"Idiopathic sclerosing peritonitis in a man. Idiopathic sclerosing peritonitis is a rare disease described in young adolescent women, characterized by fibrosis and adhesions of the peritoneum to loops of the small bowel. Here we describe a 35-year-old man who underwent exploratory laparotomy for repeated small bowel obstruction. Only partial resection of the terminal ileum was possible because of adhesions; recurrent abdominal infections and leakage from anastomosis required further resection, which ultimately resulted in short bowel syndrome and malabsorption. The clinical and pathological findings were characteristic for idiopathic sclerosing peritonitis. We review the relevant literature, to confirm, to the best of our knowledge, that this is the first report of a male patient who has developed this rare disease. ",0
"Malignant potential of juvenile polyposis coli. Report of a case and review of the literature. Juvenile polyps of the colon and rectum traditionally have been viewed as being benign inflammatory or harmartomatous lesions without potential for malignant change. The authors report a case of adenocarcinoma developing in a patient with sporadic juvenile polyposis. Juvenile polyposis was diagnosed in the patient at age 4 years. He underwent subtotal colectomy at age 6 years. At age 12, he underwent a proctectomy and a Swenson pull-through because of adenomatous changes in the rectal stump. At age 19 surveillance endoscopy revealed invasive cancer in a juvenile polyp. ",0
"Dental enamel defects in first-degree relatives of coeliac disease patients. To find out whether dental changes can be used to screen for coeliac disease among apparently healthy relatives of patients with the disorder, 56 healthy first-degree relatives of such patients were subjected to dental examination and small bowel biopsy. 25 had coeliac-type general permanent-tooth enamel lesions. All 7 who had histological evidence of coeliac disease also had enamel lesions. The finding that enamel defects may occur without small bowel changes must be borne in mind in screening. The coeliac-type enamel changes were strongly associated with HLA-DR3, and most of the DR3 alleles belonged to the extended haplotype A1; B8; DR3 group. ",0
"Impact of anatomical radical prostatectomy on urinary continence. Urinary continence following an anatomical approach to radical prostatectomy was evaluated in 593 consecutive patients, 547 (92%) of whom achieved complete urinary control. Stress incontinence was present in 46 patients (8%), of whom 34 (6%) wore 1 or fewer pads per day and 2 (0.3%) required placement of an artificial sphincter. No patient was totally incontinent. Age, weight of the prostate, prior transurethral resection of the prostate, pathological stage and preservation or wide excision of the neurovascular bundles had no significant influence on preservation of urinary control. These data suggest that anatomical factors rather than preservation of autonomic innervation may be responsible for the improved urinary control associated with an anatomical approach to radical prostatectomy.

"Spinal accessory nerve palsy: an unusual complication of coronary artery bypass The neurologic complications of coronary artery bypass surgery have been well documented, with a reported incidence of 61% in one large study. Most injuries to the peripheral nervous system involve the brachial plexus. We report the first case of a spinal accessory nerve lesion after coronary bypass surgery. The patient presented with progressive right shoulder weakness. Electrodiagnostic studies revealed a partial lesion of the right spinal accessory nerve. Physical therapy, including strengthening, range of motion, and electric stimulation to the right shoulder, was prescribed to assist recovery of strength and function. Repeat electrodiagnostic studies confirmed nerve regeneration. Prompt recognition of spinal accessory nerve damage after coronary bypass surgery is essential. Early rehabilitation will improve the chances of a better functional outcome. ",0
"Coagulation factor abnormalities as possible thrombotic risk factors after Fontan operations. Severe thromboembolism occurred in 3 of 37 patients who had undergone Fontan-type operations for correction of congenital heart defects several months to years after the operation. The patients were screened for coagulation factor abnormalities to find out whether known prothrombotic risk factors could explain the high frequency of thromboembolism. 63 abnormalities were found in 24 of the 37 patients. The commonest and most pronounced abnormality was deficiency of protein C, a known risk factor. Concentrations of antithrombin III and factors II and X were significantly lower in protein-C-deficient patients than in those with normal protein C concentrations. These findings suggest that the high thrombotic risk in these patients is caused or at least associated with an imbalance between procoagulant and anticoagulant factors. ",0
"Current status of duplex Doppler ultrasound in the examination of the abdominal vasculature. Duplex Doppler ultrasound has come to play a central role in the diagnosis of a broad spectrum of vascular diseases such as carotid artery occlusive disease and deep vein thrombosis. The role of duplex Doppler in the evaluation of intra-abdominal vascular disease remains unclear. This article summarizes the current status of duplex scanning in the investigation of the mesenteric arteries, the renal arteries, and the portal venous system. The examination is technically demanding, operator-dependent, time-consuming, and frequently unsatisfactory due to bowel gas, obesity, complex anatomy, or postoperative alterations in the normal anatomic patterns. Its advantages reside primarily in the absence of toxicity and in the generation of physiologic as well as anatomic information. In centers with the proper instrumentation and a skilled technician, duplex examination can be useful in the diagnosis and management of abdominal vascular disease and avoids the inherent dangers of contrast angiography.

"Community lifestyle characteristics and risk of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in children. High rates of leukaemia in children and young people have been associated with features of community isolation and population growth. Incidence data collected by two specialist registries were used to compare incidence rates at ward level with relevant ward characteristics derived from routine census and Ordnance Survey data for England and Wales. An excess risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) was found for wards which are farthest from large urban centres. The excess was greatest for wards of higher socioeconomic status and for children aged 1-7 years (the childhood peak), for which a two-fold excess was seen. These findings in general support the hypothesis that childhood leukaemia has an infectious aetiology. ",0
"Mapping of the locus for X-linked cardioskeletal myopathy with neutropenia and abnormal mitochondria (Barth syndrome) to Xq28. X-linked cardioskeletal myopathy with neutropenia and abnormal mitochondria is clinically characterized by congenital dilated cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, recurrent bacterial infections, and growth retardation. We analyzed linkage between the disease locus and X-chromosomal markers in a family with seven carriers, four patients, and eight unaffected sons of carriers. Highest lod scores obtained by two-point linkage analysis were 2.70 for St14.1 (DXS52, TaqI) at a recombination fraction of zero and 2.53 for cpX67 (DXS134) at a recombination fraction of zero. Multipoint linkage analysis resulted in a maximum lod score of 5.24 at the position of St35.691 (DXS305). The most distal recombination detected in this family was located between the markers II-10 (DXS466) and DX13 (DXS15). These data indicate the location of the mutated gene at Xq28. ",0
"Topical fibronectin and aprotinin for keratectomy wound healing in rabbits. We evaluated the effect of fibronectin (an adhesive protein) and aprotinin (a protease inhibitor) as single or combined topical therapies for primary healing and prevention of recurrent corneal epithelial defects in the rabbit keratectomy wound model. The biological activity of the prepared solutions of rabbit plasma fibronectin (0.6 g/L) was suggested by in vitro assays of rabbit corneal epithelial cell adhesion and gelatin-binding affinity. In the first experiment, we compared fibronectin, albumin (a control nonadhesive protein), and saline. In the second and third experiments, fibronectin supplemented with aprotinin, aprotinin alone, and saline were compared; aprotinin was used at concentrations of 40 and 1000 kallikrein inactivating units (KIU) per mililiter. Our results suggest that topical fibronectin, 0.6 g/L, as well as aprotinin at 40- and 1000-KIU/mL concentrations, given alone or in combination, neither promote corneal epithelial wound healing nor prevent recurrent corneal epithelial defects in rabbit keratectomy wounds.

"Translocation breakpoint of acute promyelocytic leukemia lies within the retinoic acid receptor alpha locus. Acute promyelocytic leukemias (APLs) are characterized by a reciprocal balanced translocation that involves chromosomes 15 and 17 [t(15;17)]. We report the isolation and characterization of one of the two reciprocal break sites and demonstrate that the chromosome 17 breakpoint lies within the retinoic acid receptor alpha locus. Nucleotide sequencing of the 15;17 cross-over junction on 15q+ showed that the retinoic acid receptor alpha gene is truncated within its first intron, 370 base pairs upstream from the splicing donor site of exon II. Such a recombination would be expected to generate abnormal RAR alpha mRNA and protein. Southern blot analysis of a number of APLs with chromosome 15- and 17-derived DNA probes revealed similar 15;17 recombinations in the majority of other APLs. Our data are strong evidence that the retinoic acid receptor alpha gene plays a crucial role in the leukemogenesis of APL. ",0
"Hepatocellular carcinoma with tumor thrombus extending into the right atrium: report of a successful resection with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. Hepatocellular carcinoma with a tumor thrombus extending into the right atrium has been considered beyond the reach of resection. These patients usually die within a short period because of pulmonary embolism, heart failure, or cancer progression. The only treatment is hepatic resection with removal of the tumor thrombus. A 38-year-old woman underwent left lobectomy with removal of the tumor thrombus with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The patient had an uneventful course and is doing well 15 months after surgery, without signs of recurrence. We have proved that hepatic resection with removal of a tumor thrombus extending into the right atrium can be carried out successfully. The next problem is whether the lives of these patients can be prolonged by this operation. ",0
Antithrombotic efficacy of continuous extradural analgesia after knee replacement. We have studied the effect of extradural analgesia on postoperative venous thrombosis in patients undergoing knee arthroplasty. Forty-eight patients were allocated randomly to receive either general anaesthesia or extradural analgesia with local anaesthetics for 3 days. All patients wore compressive elastic stockings and no anticoagulant drugs were administered. Bilateral venography was performed 10 days after surgery. Continuous extradural analgesia did not impede mobilization of the patients. One case of nonfatal pulmonary embolism occurred in a patient who received general anaesthesia. The use of continuous extradural analgesia resulted in a significant difference in the total incidence of deep vein thrombosis (18% compared with 59% after general anaesthesia (P = 0.02]. The incidence of calf vein thrombosis was 12% compared with 45% after general anaesthesia (P = 0.05). ,0
"Brainstem auditory evoked response and subcortical abnormalities in autism. Previous studies of the neurobiology of autism that have used the brainstem auditory evoked response have given contradictory results. The authors of this study considered two supplementary aspects; they added an ipsilateral masking procedure, and they compared the results for every subject to the values (corrected for age and sex) of a large number of normal children. Twenty autistic (according to DSM-III-R criteria) and 13 mentally retarded (nonverbal IQ less than 75) subjects were assessed. Eighty percent of the autistic subjects had abnormal interpeak latencies, compared to 15% of the mentally retarded subjects. The I-V and III-V prolonged interpeak latency values were seen only in the autistic subjects. The ipsilateral masking procedure doubled the rate of detection of higher-brainstem abnormalities in the autistic children. ",0
"Repeat hepatic resection for primary and metastatic carcinoma of the liver. During the last 15 years, 19 patients underwent repeated hepatic resections for malignant lesions of the liver. The first hepatic resection had been performed four to 40 months earlier for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (nine patients) or hepatic metastases (ten patients), eight of which were of colorectal origin. Repeat resection was an extensive hepatectomy in six, a segmentectomy in six and a local excision in seven. In one patient, three wedge resections and, finally, hepatic transplantation were subsequently performed after an initial extended right lobectomy. The operative mortality rate was 5.2 per cent. The three year actuarial survival rate was 64 per cent after the second resection. ",0
"Extrahepatic metabolism of morphine occurs in humans. The pharmacokinetics of morphine was studied in six patients in whom a radiologic localization of an insulinoma was to be performed under general anesthesia. Sampling was done in the peripheral artery, the mesenteric vein in five of the six patients, the hepatic vein, and the peripheral vein, as well as in urine. Hepatic blood flow was estimated by an indocyanine green infusion technique at the end of the radiologic procedure. Morphine terminal half-life was 92 +/- 9 minutes, total body clearance was 1260 ml.min-1, and the hepatic extraction ratio was 0.65 +/- 0.11. No concentration gradient was observed between the artery and the superior mesenteric vein, showing that no gut wall metabolism of morphine occurred. The total body clearance exceeded the hepatic clearance by 38%. It was concluded that the extrahepatic extraintestinal clearance of morphine probably occurred through the kidney. ",0
"Inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm: an indication for the retroperitoneal approach. In three recent cases, one of which is described in this report, we have found the retroperitoneal approach to have the following significant and distinct advantages over the transabdominal repair of inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms: (1) The posterolateral aspect of the aorta characteristically is not significantly involved by the inflammatory process, whereas the anterior aspect is. (2) The duodenum does not need to be dissected away from the aorta and, in fact, is not seen. (3) The left renal vein moves up off the neck of the aneurysm with forward mobilization of the kidney, facilitating proximal control. Now that the computerized tomography scan has become the preferred preoperative imaging technique for abdominal aortic aneurysms, the diagnosis of inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm can routinely be made before elective operation allowing the retroperitoneal approach to be selected.

"Bilateral vocal cord teflon injection. An ineffective treatment for recurrent aspiration pneumonia. Recurrent aspiration pneumonia is a potentially lethal problem, and its treatment is controversial. A variety of procedures have been advocated to prevent aspiration. These are reviewed briefly. We have been dissatisfied with established procedures because they usually require external approaches with considerable complexity and potential complications. Therefore, we attempted to obstruct the glottic airway by injecting both vocal cords with Teflon in a series of patients with recurrent aspiration pneumonia secondary to severe neurologic impairments. Since Teflon injection of the vocal cords bilaterally did not reliably prevent aspiration, we cannot recommend it for routine use in the treatment of chronic aspiration. ",0
Streptococcal antibody cross-reactivity with HLA-DR4+VE B-lymphocytes. Basis of the DR4 associated genetic predisposition to rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease? [published erratum appears in Br J Rheumatol 1991 Jun;30(3):222] B-lymphocytes obtained from patients with either rheumatic fever or rheumatic heart disease and from normal subjects were reacted with serum obtained from rabbits immunized with streptococcal cell wall antigen. The presence of cytotoxicity was sought using an inverted phase microscope after differential uptake of eosin dye. The serum was found to be significantly more cytotoxic to HLA-DR4 containing cells of both patients and normals compared with DR4 negative cells (P less than 0.0001). ,0
"Prostacyclin-to-thromboxane A2 ratio in arteriogenic impotence. It has been suggested that penile hypercoagulability predisposes to aging penile vascular changes and impotence, and that elevated thromboxane A2 during erection may contribute to hypercoagulability and atherosclerosis. Since the ratio of the prostacyclin concentration to the thromboxane A2 concentration is constantly maintained in normal hemostatic responses, an imbalance between thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin may be a factor to initiate vascular diseases and decrease blood flow. We assess the usefulness of the prostacyclin-to-thromboxane A2 ratio in penile blood during erection for diagnosis of arteriogenic impotence. The ratio in the arteriogenic impotence group was significantly lower (p less than 0.01) than in the psychogenic and venogenic impotence groups. Therefore, the prostacyclin-to-thromboxane A2 ratio seems to be useful to diagnose arteriogenic impotence. ",0
"Cerebral venography with MR. The authors describe a two-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance (MR) angiography technique to create projection venograms of the head. The technique was applied to 27 healthy volunteers and 39 patients. The superior sagittal and straight sinuses, the internal cerebral veins, and the Galen vein were visualized in all the volunteers. Other veins were seen in a high percentage of subjects. Systematic comparison of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) after intraarterial contrast medium injection and MR venography in patients showed good correlation between the two techniques. MR venography proved helpful in identifying thrombosis or patency of cerebral veins and sinuses and showed collateral venous drainage and venous drainage from arteriovenous malformations. There was good correlation between conventional contrast angiography and MR venography. In conclusion, MR venography is considered reliable for showing the cerebral venous system and provides information additional to that of conventional spin-echo imaging. ",0
"Hemodynamic effects of partial correction of chronic anemia by recombinant human erythropoietin in patients on dialysis. Eighteen patients on chronic hemodialysis with renal anemia were treated with recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO). Hemodynamic parameters in the resting state were determined before and after successful treatment. Posttreatment cardiac index was decreased (3.3 v 2.8 L/min/m2), whereas diastolic blood pressure (72 v 79 mm Hg) and calculated peripheral resistance (2,230 v 2,860 dyne.cm.s-5) were increased significantly when compared with the pretreatment period. We conclude from our study that the increase of blood pressure as seen in patients on dialysis, who are effectively treated with r-HuEPO, is due to an increase in peripheral resistance. This increase overrules the decrease of cardiac index and might well be a result of peripheral vasoconstriction due to improved oxygen availability. ",0
"Genitourinary cancer in the elderly. The subject of genitourinary cancer in the elderly becomes increasingly more important as our population of patients older than 50 years expands. Carcinoma of the kidney, bladder, and prostate all have an increasing incidence over the age of 50 and have a predilection for afflicting men more commonly than women. Etiologic factors, especially with bladder and kidney carcinomas, are well documented and in some cases preventable. Screening the urine for hematuria and careful digital rectal examinations may uncover a higher percentage of these malignancies in earlier, more curable stages. Recent advances in the treatment of all of these malignancies have improved survival and quality of life for these patients. ",0
"Late luteal phase dysphoric disorder in young women. The authors determined the prevalence of late luteal phase dysphoric disorder in 217 university women aged 17-29 years. Unaware of the focus on premenstrual syndrome (PMS), the participants rated DSM-III-R symptoms of late luteal phase dysphoric disorder over 90 days. Using a 30% or greater premenstrual change as an index of luteal variation, the authors found that 10 women (4.6%) met the symptom criteria during two menstrual cycles. Compared to 25 young women seeking treatment for PMS who met the same diagnostic criteria, the 10 women from the university sample reported significantly less fatigue and impaired concentration and somewhat less severe depression and overall symptoms.

"Reference values for the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in octo- and nonagenarians The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used in a population survey of all inhabitants of Leiden, the Netherlands, over 85 years (n = 1258). In this paper we report on 532 subjects without neurological or psychiatric disease. Results show that the median score and lowest quartile cut-off score remain high until the tenth decade (median score = 28, lowest quartile cut-off score = 26). Thus age, in itself, is not a major limitation in using the MMSE. In this study a comparatively low level of education (the majority had 6 to 7 years of education) did not affect the results on the MMSE in a negative way, nor did we find an association with the use of psychoactive drugs.

"Olfactory neuroblastoma: clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical characterization of four representative cases. Olfactory neuroblastomas are rare tumors whose clinical prognosis is not predictable by assessment of initial stage or grade. The pathologic diagnosis is often difficult because of the wide range of the patient's age and histologies. In this report, we document that the diagnosis of olfactory neuroblastoma can be clarified by immunohistochemical demonstration of a unique antigenic profile that can be obtained in routinely processed biopsies. We describe four cases of olfactory neuroblastoma diagnosed and treated from 1979 to 1989, each confirmed by immunohistology. One of our patients was misdiagnosed twice at an outside institution, first as having nasopharyngeal carcinoma and then as having small-cell, undifferentiated ""oat cell"" carcinoma. Despite accurate tumor diagnosis and appropriate therapy, we found that there was no apparent correlation of clinical outcome with Kadish clinical stage or histologic grade of tumor. ",0
"Reversal of colchicine-induced mitotic arrest in Chinese hamster cells with a colchicine-specific monoclonal antibody. The ability of a high-affinity colchicine-binding monoclonal antibody to reverse the effects of colchicine on Chinese hamster ovary cells was investigated. Using flow cytometry, a complete mitotic blockade was demonstrated after 16 hours with 2.5 x 10(-7) mol/l (molar) colchicine. Colchicine-induced changes were reversible when equimolar antibody was added simultaneously with or up to 6 hours after colchicine. With further delay in addition of antibody, a progressive irreversible increase in mitotic blockade and increase in mean cell size was observed. Prolonged colchicine exposure, without antibody reversal, led to polyploidy and structural chromosome breakage. Early antibody reversal restored cells to the diploid state, whereas delayed reversal resulted in a time-dependent increase in polyploidy. Colchicine-induced polyploidy and chromosomal aberrations may be the basis for both colchicine toxicity and the time-dependent increase in irreversibility of colchicine effects. ",0
The justification for surgical treatment of metastatic melanoma of the gastrointestinal tract. Fifty-six patients with symptomatic metastatic melanoma of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) treated surgically at the Sydney Melanoma Unit between 1974 and 1989 were reviewed. The majority of these patients presented with abdominal pain or symptoms of anemia. The small intestine was the site of metastasis in more than 80 per cent. The mean over-all survival time was 11.7 months (range of one to 60 months) after surgical treatment of a first metastasis to the GIT and 3.6 months (range of zero to 12 months) postoperatively for a second GIT metastasis. Forty-four of the patients reported complete relief of their symptoms postoperatively. The results suggest that an aggressive approach to symptomatic GIT metastases from malignant melanoma is justified both to relieve distressing symptoms and to prolong life. ,0
"Fourth branchial pouch anomaly. We present an extremely rare case of fourth branchial fistula in a 23-year-old male. The characteristic clinical feature was a recurrent left lower neck abscess which did not respond to appropriate medical and surgical therapy. Radiography and a computed tomographic scan with contrast material revealed a fistula running from the apex of the left pyriform sinus (internal opening) to the left lower neck abscess. The fistula tract was excised surgically. Histological examination of the excised fistula revealed a squamous epithelial lining and subepithelial lymphoid tissue. This pyriform sinus fistula is thought to be of fourth pharyngeal pouch origin, because of its surgical aspects and the histological findings of the excised fistula. ",0
"Plasma exchange in chronic progressive multiple sclerosis: a long-term study. Plasma exchange (PE) was shown in a previous double-blind randomized controlled study to confer significant additional benefit at 1 year upon patients with chronic progressive multiple sclerosis (CPMS) treated with immunosuppressive drug therapy (ISDT). Efficacy over an extended term, indications for retreatment, and long-term toxicity are dealt with in this analysis of a larger number of patients. During the past 7 years, 200 patients with CPMS have been treated with PE and low-dose ISDT at this center. Improvement on the Kurtzke Disability Status Scale by one or more steps post-therapy and at 3-year follow-up is significant by comparison with pre-PE disability status. Clinical improvement was maintained in the majority of patients, reaching as far as a 6-year follow-up. Major life-threatening complications attributable to this combined therapy were not observed.

"Mastalgia refractory to drug treatment. Management of the patient with mastalgia who fails to respond to first line therapy is a difficult problem and there is a group of patients who do not respond to any therapy. A group of 126 patients with mastalgia who failed to respond to first line therapy and completed further treatment options was studied. The response rate of those with cyclical mastalgia fell to 57 and 25 per cent for second and third line therapy respectively. Equivalent figures for non-cyclical mastalgia were 24 and 21 per cent. Danazol maintains a high response rate after the failure of other drugs, whereas the second line response to bromocriptine and evening primrose oil is poor. Unresponsive patients were matched to a group of patients who responded to first line therapy, and reproductive and historical factors were compared using the chi 2 test, but failed to identify which patients would respond to therapy.

Solitary fibromatosis of bone. A rare variant of congenital generalized fibromatosis. Congenital generalized fibromatosis is part of the spectrum of the fibromatoses of infancy and childhood. The lesions are usually multiple and fibrous in nature. They may appear in virtually every organ outside the central nervous system. Congenital generalized fibromatosis can be limited to the skeleton and rarely manifests itself as a solitary bone lesion. Solitary osseous lesions often behave differently than multiple osseous lesions. Solitary lesions often do not regress without treatment and can have a high incidence of recurrence with less than marginal excision. Multiple osseous lesions often regress without treatment. ,0
"Emergency center ultrasonography in the evaluation of hemoperitoneum: a prospective study. The reliability of ultrasonographic detection (US) of hemoperitoneum in blunt abdominal trauma was evaluated in a prospective study of 72 patients. Independent of the examiner, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were, respectively, 86.7%, 100%, and 97.2%. Laparotomy was indicated in 76.9% of US hemoperitoneum-positive cases. No negative laparotomies were performed in this study group. If hemoperitoneum is revealed in US and vital signs are unstable, we think laparotomy is indicated. We believe that US in an emergency center is a quick, safe screening method in the evaluation of blunt abdominal trauma. US might take over a great part of the role of diagnostic peritoneal lavage.

"Role of surgery in antibiotic-induced pseudomembranous enterocolitis. With the increased use of prophylactic and broad-spectrum antibiotics, pseudomembranous colitis has emerged as a significant clinical problem. Management with specific anti-Clostridium difficile therapy (vancomycin or metronidazole) has reduced mortality to less than 2%. Nevertheless, the disease may progress to a fulminant toxic colitis or colonic perforation. Additionally, another subset of patients will present with a dramatic clinical picture, suggesting acute peritonitis, eventuating in unnecessary laparotomy. This report reviews both the medical and surgical literature during the past 15 years of patients treated for pseudomembranous colitis. Analysis of this clinical data has provided us with the opportunity to both define the role of surgery in this disorder and illustrate the necessity for a combined medical and surgical cooperative approach in the early management of this iatrogenic disease.

"Chronic otitis media: the significance of nasal obstruction. The nasal airway resistance of 15 patients with unilateral chronic otitis media and 15 controls was measured by anterior active rhinomanometry. Airway resistance was measured on each side before and after decongestion to differentiate resistance due to structural abnormality from that due to mucosal swelling. The nasal resistance was significantly greater (P less than 0.01) on the side of the affected ear in patients with unilateral chronic otitis media before decongestion, but following decongestion the difference was not significant. Nasal obstruction is a significant determinant in unilateral chronic otitis media and although septal displacement may be the underlying cause, the major component of the obstruction appears to be due to an associated mucosal oedema.

"Secondary femoral-distal bypass. Thirty-nine secondary femoral-distal (femorotibial and femoroperoneal) bypasses were reviewed and compared to 89 primary femoral-distal bypasses (done during the same time period) to investigate the efficacy of secondary femoral-distal bypass. Graft patency at 2 years by life table analysis was similar in both groups (38% primary group vs 36% secondary group). However, limb salvage was significantly less in the secondary group (52% vs 68% at 2 years, p less than 0.05). This decrease was primarily due to poorer limb salvage using composite grafts (prosthetic/vein) compared to vein grafts in patients who underwent secondary femoral-distal bypasses (37% vs 76% at 2 years, p less than 0.05). Postoperative wound infections and mortality were similar in both groups. Thus, femoral-distal bypass after failure of a previous infrainguinal reconstruction offers good long-term limb salvage with acceptable surgical risk when autologous vein is available for use as the arterial conduit.

"Late recurrence of a hepatocellular carcinoma in a patient with incomplete Alagille syndrome. In this study, the case of a patient presenting a second hepatocellular carcinoma 13 years after resection of a first tumor of the same type is reported. In this case, etiological investigations remained negative, but an incomplete form of syndromatic Alagille syndrome with paucity of bile ducts in the nontumoral tissue was detected and associated with nodular regenerative hyperplasia and foci of dysplasia. Malignant transformation in Alagille syndrome seems to be extremely rare. The fact that such tumors evolve very slowly could be an argument for partial hepatectomy and, if necessary, liver transplantation. ",0
"Artificial urinary sphincter insertion in congenital neuropathic bladder. A series of 44 patients with neuropathic bladder dysfunction due to congenital myelodysplasia underwent implantation of an artificial urinary sphincter (AUS); in 26 patients a reconstructive procedure was performed at the same time. Five patients who initially had AUS implantation alone developed detrusor hyper-reflexia and required a clam cystoplasty. Forty patients (90%) are continent, 2 are occasionally damp and 2 are wet and awaiting further surgery; 66% of patients who underwent AUS insertion and reconstruction were found to have significant residual urine and they perform intermittent self-catheterisation (ISC). In patients with a good bladder capacity and normal compliance and detrusor hyper-reflexia controlled by anticholinergic drugs, cystoplasty is not necessary at the time of AUS insertion. ",0
"Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV: diagnosis and therapy of associated bowel perforation. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV is a heritable disease of type III collagen metabolism. This diagnosis is suspected in a patient with a combination of clinical manifestations and family history, but it is confirmed only by culture of the patient's skin fibroblasts and demonstration of a defect in type III collagen metabolism. The disease may rarely present with spontaneous colonic perforation, a complication traditionally treated by primary closure of the perforated segment and creation of an end colostomy. Attempts at bowel reanastomosis have often resulted in repeated colon perforations. We present the first patient with Ehlers-Danlos type IV syndrome to develop a colon perforation proximal to an end colostomy, and discuss the surgical strategy to prevent recurrences of this and other postoperative complications associated with the syndrome.

"Emerging techniques in the diagnosis of sinusitis. In recent years, the high prevalence of chronic sinusitis has been noted in isolation and in association with bronchial asthma, aspirin sensitivity, and perennial rhinitis. Many sinus-associated symptoms arise from nasal rather than sinus pathology; thus, it is important to detect the presence, extent, and nature of any disease within the sinus cavities. Conventional plain radiographs have limited sensitivity and have been supplanted by more widespread use of computerized tomography. The role of other modalities such as ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging has not yet been completely determined. Other tests such as cytology and endoscopy can detect the presence of infection without the need for invasive antral puncture. Practitioners should consider the impact of a negative imaging test on their therapeutic plan and order tests on that basis. ",0
"Variceal rebleeding after portosystemic shunting. Strategies and solutions to a vexing problem. The purpose of this review was to discuss an approach to the treatment of recurrent bleeding from esophageal or gastric varices after portosystemic shunt. From our own clinical experience, as well as that of others, it appears that re-establishment of portal decompression should offer the best chance at long-term survival. Luckily, innovations in angiographic technique have allowed attainment of this goal without the inordinate risk of an operative procedure. However, not all patients' situations will be amenable to such treatment. For some of them, operative decompression of the portal venous system can be carried out in an anatomic area previously untouched. For those patients in whom no decompression is possible, direct endoscopic treatment of the varices will offer an alternative, albeit temporizing, approach. ",0
"Natural death as viewed by the medical examiner: a review of 1000 consecutive autopsies of individuals dying of natural disease. A study of 1000 consecutive autopsies of individuals dying of natural disease was conducted. Cardiovascular disease was responsible for 60.9% of all deaths with coronary artery disease--not only the main cause of cardiovascular death but also the main cause of all natural deaths--accounting for 45.1% of such cases. Diseases of the central nervous and respiratory systems accounted for 8.7 and 8.6%, respectively, of the natural deaths. Seizure disorders and pneumonia were the main causes of death in these organ systems. There were 124 deaths of children less than one year in age, 91 of which were due to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). All of the SIDS deaths were in children less than 10 months old. ",0
"Infective dermatitis of Jamaican children: a marker for HTLV-I infection In Jamaican children infective dermatitis is a chronic eczema associated with refractory nonvirulent Staphylococcus aureus or beta-haemolytic streptococcus infection of the skin and nasal vestibule. 14 children between the ages of 2 and 17 years with typical infective dermatitis, attending the dermatology clinic at the University Hospital of the West Indies in Jamaica, were tested for antibody to human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). All were seropositive, whereas 11 children of similar age with atopic eczema were all negative. In 2 of 2 cases of infective dermatitis, the biological mother was HTLV-1 seropositive. None of the 14 patients showed signs of adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma, though experience with previous cases of infective dermatitis indicates the possibility of such progression. ",0
"Evaluation of antral mast cells in nonulcer dyspepsia. Two hundred twenty-five patients with the symptoms of nonulcer dyspepsia underwent clinical and endoscopic evaluation including histologic assessment of endoscopic biopsies. Mast cells were counted after special staining with low pH Alcian blue. Of 225 patients, 31 (13%) were found to have 11 or greater mast cells per high-power field. Endoscopic and routine histologic findings were similar between the subset of 31 patients with 11 or more mast cells and the entire group of 225. The 31 patients with increased antral mast cells had failed treatment with standard drug used for peptic ulcer disease. H1-antagonists improved symptoms in the majority of patients (79%) in whom we had adequate follow-up. Patients with increased mast cells on antral biopsy appear to be subset of patients with nonulcer dyspepsia amenable specific treatment with H1-antagonists. ",0
"Multiple arterial fenestrations, multiple aneurysms, and an arteriovenous malformation in a patient with subarachnoid hemorrhage. We report the case of a 49-year-old, right-handed man with multiple vascular pathologies, including a fenestrated anterior communicating artery and middle cerebral artery, an aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery, multiple aneurysms of the middle cerebral artery, and an arteriovenous malformation. Diagnoses were made through computed tomography, cerebral angiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and intraoperative dissection. The lesions were managed surgically in stages with satisfactory results. Congenital and hemodynamic factors may have combined to manifest in the anomalies present in this unique case. We believe that no similar combination of vascular pathology has been reported previously. ",0
"Relevance of focal cerebral ischemia models. Experience with fibrinolytic agents. Despite the limitations of individual ischemia models, experience with fibrinolytic agents suggests that 1) early intervention with rt-PA may result in rapid thrombolysis, functional recovery, and decreased mortality in small animal stroke thromboembolism models, 2) rt-PA has no general effect on clinical recovery following MCA occlusion and reperfusion in the nonhuman primate at dose rates capable of producing very high circulating rt-PA levels, while u-PA has an apparently salutary effect, and 3) intravenous infusion of rt-PA or u-PA early after ischemia/infarction in several model systems is not associated with significant intracerebral hemorrhage. The true clinical relevance of these general impressions must await the completion of human studies and studies in well-conceived models designed to define the vascular consequences to be expected from reperfusion achievable with thrombolytic agents.

"Functional outcome measures in stroke rehabilitation. I examine statistical considerations in the analysis of functional outcome following stroke and discuss the mathematical relation between improvement in function and discharge functional score. I demonstrate mathematically that the predictor variables of improvement and discharge functional score are the same and that the regression coefficients for improvement and discharge functional score will be equal, except for the admission functional score, for which a mathematically defined relation exists. I argue that the relation between admission functional score and discharge functional score must be positive and strong and that the relation between admission functional score and improvement must be negative for the stroke population. I believe that an ignorance of statistical concepts, especially confounding, and of the differences between raw correlations, partial correlations, and predictors have led to much confusion in functional outcome research.

"Extrageniculate vision in hemianopic humans: saccade inhibition by signals in the blind field. The functional competence of extrageniculate visual pathways in hemianopic humans was demonstrated by showing that distractor signals in the blind half of the visual field could inhibit saccades toward targets in the intact visual field. This inhibitory effect of unseen distractors in patients occurred only when distractors were presented in the temporal half of the visual field, was specific to oculomotor responses, and did not occur in normal subjects. These results show that a peripheral visual signal activates retinotectal pathways to prime the oculomotor system and that these pathways can mediate orienting behavior in hemianopic humans. ",0
"The relation of serum cholesterol to risk of coronary heart disease: implications for the elderly. Elevated cholesterol is a known risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD) in young and middle-aged persons. Because of the high prevalence of CHD in a growing elderly population, physicians must decide whether to devote clinical attention to this condition in older patients. Longitudinal cohort studies show that while the association between serum cholesterol and CHD decreases after age 55 years, it still persists. Primary prevention trials performed mostly on middle-aged men have reduced the incidence rate of CHD through cholesterol lowering but they have yet to show a reduction in overall mortality. Secondary prevention studies of lipid alteration have reported decreased mortality and slowed progression of coronary stenoses, again in predominantly male subjects aged less than 60 years. Implications of these findings for care of older patients are discussed along with recommendations for clinical management and future research. ",0
"Detection of loss of heterozygosity in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor specimens by the polymerase chain reaction. A polymerase chain reaction-based procedure was used for the detection of DNA length polymorphisms generated by naturally occurring genetic deletions or insertions of known sequence. This method consists of a simple one-step assay that does not require any restriction enzyme analysis or Southern blot hybridization, allowing identification in ethidium bromide-stained gels. The procedure described here was used to detect loss of heterozygosity at various loci, including the Hbb beta-globin gene cluster, in chemically induced mouse skin tumors, using a variety of tissue preparations, including microdissection of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens, short-term cultures, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting of epithelial populations. This approach may be useful in detecting tumor-specific reduction to homozygosity at polymorphic chromosomal loci, allowing the mapping of putative tumor-suppressor loci involved in carcinogenesis.

"Association of Escherichia coli HEp-2 adherence patterns with type and duration of diarrhoea. 373 (59%) out of 636 faecal specimens obtained during the first 2 years of life of 72 Mexican children yielded adherent Escherichia coli (HEp-2 cells). Strains with localised adherence were significantly associated with acute non-bloody diarrhoea, whereas strains with aggregative adherence were significantly associated with persistent diarrhoea. Half the strains with localised adherence were not enteropathogenic E coli serotypes nor did they hybridise with an enteropathogenic E coli adherence factor DNA probe. All strains with localised adherence gave a positive fluorescent actin staining (FAS) assay, irrespective of serotype. One-third of children colonised by aggregative strains had bloody diarrhoea. Isolation of strains with diffuse adherence was not related to type or duration of diarrhoea but was generally associated with isolation of another pathogenic organism. ",0
"Vertical partial laryngectomy on demand. The author proposes the term 'vertical partial laryngectomy on demand' for all modifications of vertical laryngectomies (frontal, frontolateral, vertical and hemilaryngectomy). This term includes two conditions: the first is complete oncological removal of the tumour (proven by histological examination and with the use of magnification or the operating microscope during the operation); secondly, reconstruction of the laryngeal defect by various procedures. The author uses the sternohyoid fascia in vertical and frontolateral partial laryngectomies. From 120 operated cases, a five-year survival rate of 81 per cent was achieved. The fascia showed resistance to post-operative complications and irradiation. ",0
"Effects of medical and surgical treatment on cerebral perfusion and cognition in patients with chronic cerebral ischemia. The effects of medical treatment with and without cerebral revascularization procedures on cognition and cerebral blood flow were compared among 36 patients with extracranial occlusive cerebrovascular disease and cognitive impairments. Three comparable groups were studied. The first group (N = 18) received only medical treatment by control of risk factors for stroke (including hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia) and antiplatelet aggregant medication. The second group (N = 10) had the same medical treatment plus superficial temporal-to-middle cerebral artery bypass, and the third group had the same medical treatment plus carotid endarterectomy. Regional cerebral blood flow and cognition were monitored in all three treatment groups over a 3-year interval. All groups showed stabilization without expected rates of decline for both cerebral blood flow and cognition, but no statistically significant differences emerged among the treatment groups. ",0
"The long-distance effects of brain lesions: visualization of myelinated pathways in the human brain using polarizing and fluorescence microscopy. We describe several new possibilities for the study of degenerated myelinated tracts in the human central nervous system (CNS). The methods are based on the visualization of myelin breakdown products that show birefringence in polarized light and, when stained with Nile blue and benzpyrene-3,4, exhibit fluorescence. Even after lengthy formalin fixation, the methods permit the localization of anterogradely degenerated tracts in a variety of fiber systems in the brains of patients who died between five and 20 months after the onset of neurological symptoms. Particularly the polarizing technique, because of its simplicity, can be added to the usual neuropathological methods for demonstrating the long-distance effects of a brain lesion. As research tools, these methods would also aid in the study of the anatomical substrate of human neurological symptomatology. ",0
"Retrograde nephrostolithotomy in management of complex renal calculi. From October 1986 to July 1990 we evaluated 22 patients with complex renal calculi in 25 kidneys for initial therapy using retrograde percutaneous nephrostolithotomy. In 3 patients we could not attain renal access in a retrograde fashion. In the remaining patients residual fragments after percutaneous nephrostolithotomy were treated with a combination of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), chemolysis and retrieval of small calculi with a flexible nephroscope. Successful treatments were achieved in 6 of the 22 kidneys (27%) using percutaneous nephrostolithotomy alone and in 17 (77%) using all modalities. Retrograde and antegrade percutaneous nephrostolithotomy in conjunction with ESWL, chemolysis and flexible nephroscopy in the treatment of patients with complex calculi yield comparable success rates. However, retrograde percutaneous nephrostolithotomy can be performed without the aid of an interventional radiologist and it provides easy access to the nondilated collecting system. ",0
Clinical and anatomic considerations for surgery in tibial disease and the results of surgery. Bypass vein grafts to the infrapopliteal arteries now achieve a 5-year cumulative patency equivalent to that of vein grafts to the popliteal arteries. The technique of in situ vein grafting to the tibial arteries is described and the results are presented. The 5-year cumulative patency for such bypasses and the 5-year limb salvage in the same patients have both been approximately 80%. These results coupled with those reported from other centers that have sizable experience in tibial artery reconstruction suggest that there has been real progress over the past decade in the salvage of lower extremities in patients with far advanced peripheral vascular disease through the use of autogenous venous bypass grafts. ,0
"Incidence of myocarditis. A 10-year autopsy study from Malmo, Sweden. Although myocarditis has been known for almost two centuries, data in regard to its incidence have varied widely. Autopsy studies have reported an incidence of 3.5% to as high as 10%. The main reason for such diversity of data appears to be the lack of unanimity as to what constitutes myocarditis. Recently, definitions of myocarditis have been proposed and precise criteria for the morphologic recognition of myocarditis have been published. In this study an analysis of 12,747 consecutive autopsies performed from 1975 to 1984 at Malmo (Sweden) General Hospital was carried out. Applying the newly proposed histologic criteria, the diagnosis of myocarditis was made in 136 cases, which constitute 1.06% of the autopsy population studied. This rate of myocarditis incidence at postmortem is lower by far than rates previously published. ",0
"Tumors of the shoulder girdle. Technique of resection and description of a surgical classification. Limb-sparing surgery is safe and reliable for most bone and soft-tissue tumors of the shoulder girdle. Eighty to ninety percent of patients with high-grade sarcomas of the shoulder can be safely treated by the various surgical techniques described. Attention must be paid to appropriate patient selection, preoperative staging, and planning. In addition, careful skeletal and muscular reconstruction of the surgical defect is necessary for a successful outcome. A new, universal, classification schemata (types I-VI) of shoulder girdle resections has been developed. This classification system is based on the bones resected, the status of the abductor mechanism, and the relationship to the glenohumeral joint. This system permits easy description and comparison of the various limb-sparing procedures performed. ",0
"Cofactors in male-female sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1. In a study of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-uninfected African prostitutes, 83 (67%) of 124 seroconverted to HIV-1. Oral contraceptive use (odds ratio [OR], 3.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-8.6; P less than .03), genital ulcers (mean annual episodes, 1.32 +/- 0.55 in seroconverting women vs. 0.48 +/- 0.21 in seronegative women; P less than .02) and Chlamydia trachomatis infections (OR, 3.6; CI, 1.3-11.0; P less than .02) were associated with increased risk of HIV-1 infection. Condom use reduced the risk of HIV-1 infection (OR, 0.11; CI, 0.05-0.27; P less than .0001). Stepwise logistic regression analysis confirmed independent associations between HIV-1 infection and oral contraceptive use, condom use, genital ulcers, and C. trachomatis. The presence of other sexually transmitted diseases may in part explain the heterosexual HIV-1 epidemic in Africa and may represent important targets for intervention to control HIV-1 infection. ",0
"Large diameter expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts for infrarenal aortic aneurysm surgery. The performance of an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft used for aortic aneurysm replacement was evaluated. ePTFE grafts were implanted in 241 patients undergoing infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. Sixty patients were operated as emergencies for aneurysm rupture and 181 electively. One hundred and fourteen bifurcated and 127 tube grafts were inserted. The transperitoneal approach was used in 64 cases and the remainder were placed using a retroperitoneal approach. There was a one-month mortality of 2.8% in elective and 20% in emergency cases. Median follow-up was 26 months. Specific graft complications included one infected graft resulting in a graft-enteric fistula. No graft rupture, degeneration, dilatation, pseudoaneurysm or late graft limb thromboses were observed in up to 7 years of follow-up. The aortic ePTFE prosthesis demonstrated satisfactory performance over the period studied. ",0
"Changes in intracochlear and intracanalicular nerves after acoustic neurinoma excision confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging findings related to the vestibulocochlear and facial nerves within the internal auditory canal were analyzed in acoustic neurinomas. T1- and proton-weighted magnetic resonance images showed that the vestibulocochlear nerves distal to the internal auditory meatus increased in signal intensity after surgical intervention. These nerves were conspicuously enhanced after intravenous administration of gadolinium diethylene-triamine-pentaacetic acid. The preserved facial nerves were also markedly enhanced postoperatively. As a possible cause of these findings, we suggest operative disruption of the blood-nerve barrier with ensuing nerve edema, although the operative procedures were carefully carried out using a surgical microscope. The clinical significance of traumatic disruption of the blood-nerve barrier and subsequent nerve edema are discussed from the standpoint of preservation of cochlear nerve function. ",0
"Anaesthetic management of the brain dead for organ donation. An increasing number of anaesthetists is being called upon to manage organ donors during organ retrieval procedures. We briefly describe the technical aspects of the surgical procedure together with a guide to the anaesthetic management. The aims of the latter may be summarized as the ""Rule of 100"": systolic blood pressure greater than 100 mmHg, urine output greater than 100 ml.hr-1, PaO2 greater than 100 mmHg, haemoglobin concentration greater than 100 g.L-1. Common management problems (hypotension, arrhythmias, diabetes insipidus, oliguria, and coagulopathy) are discussed in detail. The intraoperative management of the brain-dead organ donor provides the anaesthetist with the challenge of a major surgical procedure in a subject with important physiological derangements. ",0
"Retroviral transduction of protein kinase C-gamma into cytotoxic T lymphocyte clones leads to immortalization with retention of specific function. The molecular pathways that are responsible for delivering the proliferative signals from the cell surface to the nucleus in T lymphocytes are still unresolved, but recent data implicates protein kinase C (PKC) involvement in the TCR signaling pathway. To further address the role of PKC in T cell activation, the effects of high level expression of the PKC-gamma isoenzyme in murine CTL clones were examined. Unlike the parental cells that required periodic Ag stimulation for cell activation and growth, cells expressing a retrovirally transduced PKC-gamma gene propagated in culture independent of the need for Ag stimulation, although maintaining identical functional specificity to the parental CTL. Constitutive PKC-gamma expression may therefore mimic physiologic PKC activation, thereby abrogating the requirement for TCR-Ag interaction in T cell activation. ",0
"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: fasting plasma levels of cysteine and inorganic sulfate are normal, as are brain contents of cysteine. Recent reports suggest that amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is caused by one or more unidentified neurotoxins that are poorly metabolized in patients to less toxic and more readily excreted compounds, and that a genetically determined defect in cysteine degradation and in inorganic sulfate production is the mechanism underlying a failure to metabolize xenobiotics normally in ALS. We measured concentrations of total cysteine and of inorganic sulfate in the plasma of age-matched groups of ALS patients and healthy control subjects and found no differences. L-Cysteine, a putative endogenous neurotoxin in ALS, was present in equal concentrations in autopsied brain from ALS patients and controls. ",0
"Childhood deaths from toy balloons. We describe four children who died of suffocation by rubber balloons in Canada between 1983 and 1988. In the United States, at least 121 children have died in a similar manner in the 15 years between 1973 and 1988 according to a report by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission. Although the highest mortality occurred among infants, 30 (25%) of the 121 deaths occurred in children 6 years of age or older. Balloons account for 43% of the approximately 15 childhood deaths related to children's products that are documented each year by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Toy rubber balloons are thus the leading cause of pediatric choking deaths from children's products. Preventive efforts should be directed toward a ban on this type of balloon and the development of safer alternatives. Meanwhile, public information campaigns should alert parents, physicians, and policymakers to the dangers of toy rubber balloons. ",0
"Pharynx: value of oblique projections for radiographic examination. The utility of oblique views for augmenting standard posteroanterior and lateral double-contrast radiography of the pharynx was examined. Over an 8-month period, two oblique views were added to the standard posteroanterior and lateral views of the pharynx during routine upper gastrointestinal studies in 102 patients divided into two groups. Group 1 consisted of 81 patients without suspected pharyngeal or esophageal disease who demonstrated what was considered to be normal anatomy on all radiographic views. Group 2 consisted of 21 patients who were known or suspected to have pathologic abnormality of the pharynx. The members of this latter group each demonstrated various abnormal pharyngeal anatomy on the standard views. In just over half of these cases the oblique projection contributed significant information not obtained with conventional views. Therefore, the authors conclude that oblique images are a beneficial addition to the diagnostic evaluation of patients highly suspected of having pharyngeal disease. ",0
"Normal pituitary gland: coronal MR imaging of infundibular tilt. To determine the prevalence of pituitary infundibular deviation or tilt as a normal variant, coronal magnetic resonance (MR) images of 50 patients who had been examined for reasons other than pituitary disease were evaluated retrospectively. Forty-six percent of the patients had a more or less pronounced tilt of the pituitary stalk. This tilt was due to developmental lateral eccentricity of the pituitary gland in relationship to the midline of the brain in 34% and to ontogenic eccentric insertion of the pituitary infundibulum off the midline of the gland in the other 12%. This high frequency of stalk deviation in patients without pituitary disease suggests that such displacement by itself should not be used to support the presence of pituitary microadenoma on MR images or computed tomograms.

"A follow-up study of intractable seizures in childhood. One hundred forty-five children with seizures that were refractory to medical therapy for at least 2 years were followed 5 to 20 years after onset. The majority of children with uncontrollable seizures (61%) were mentally retarded, and most of these (73%) had onset of seizures at younger than 2 years of age. Age of onset was significantly later (mean 5.0 +/- 0.5 yr [SEM]) in the group of children with borderline to normal intelligence. Follow-up data showed remission of seizures in a significant proportion of children with borderline or normal intelligence, with a linear decrease of the percentage with persistent seizures at a rate of about 4% per year. Remission of seizures was much less frequent (1.5%/yr) in the group with mental retardation. Seizure type had some effects on outcome. Children with focal atrophic brain lesions did no worse than those without definable pathology on brain-imaging studies. ",0
"Long term follow-up of descending thoracic aorto-iliac/femoral bypass. A prospective study of 26 patients undergoing descending thoracic aorto-iliac/femoral (DTAI/F) bypass was conducted over a 13-year period with an average follow up of 53 months. Reasons for selecting the procedure were occluded aortic bifurcation grafts (9 patients), hostile abdomen (6), infected aortic graft (1), microaorta (10, and surgeons preference in 8 patients who had juxtarenal aortic occlusion. The operative mortality was 3.8% (1 patient). A late mortality of 36% was due to myocardial infarction (1), lung carcinoma (2), renal failure (4), stroke (1) and pulmonary insufficiency (1). Graft failure occurred in 4 patients at 23, 26, 54 and 109 months respectively. Primary cumulative patency was 86% statistically valid at 42 months. DTAI/F bypass is recommended in selected patients when conventional approaches to the aorta are considered unduly hazardous. ",0
"Risk factors for gestational diabetes in black population. In a long-term longitudinal study of gestational diabetes mellitus in Black women, risk factors that were identified were age, obesity, a family history of diabetes, and the presence of hypertension. Poor predictors were a history of a previous large-for-date infant, parity, and age at first pregnancy. The prevalence of smooth muscle and nuclear autoantibodies was higher in gestational diabetic subjects. Gestational diabetic subjects who required insulin for glycemic control were more obese, had a lower frequency of the Bf-F phenotype and a higher frequency of the Bf-F1 phenotype, and had a lower frequency of the type 2 allele at the polymorphic locus adjacent to the insulin gene. Restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms flanking the insulin and apolipoprotein A-I and C-III genes, although not associated with gestational diabetes mellitus, may be associated with hyperlipidemia and subsequent atherosclerosis.

"Tumor factors predicting for prognosis in metastatic breast cancer. The presence of P24 predicts for response to treatment and duration of survival. Fifty-one patients with metastatic breast cancer were investigated to determine tumor parameters with prognostic significance. Investigations included determinations of P24 content by immunocytochemical means using a monoclonal antibody to P24 protein; immunocytochemical analysis of estrogen and progesterone receptors; ploidy analysis by flow cytometry, and histologic grading. There were significant correlations between the presence of P24 and estrogen receptor, between histologic grade and P24 expression, and between estrogen and progesterone receptors. Of the tumor factors investigated only P24 protein was, however, of prognostic significance. Patients with P24-positive tumors had a significantly higher rate of response to treatment as well as more prolonged duration of response and duration of survival from diagnosis of metastatic disease. None of the other variables investigated were significantly predictive of outcome. P24 protein may be a useful predictor of prognosis in metastatic breast cancer. ",0
"Surgical resection of cor triatriatum in a 74-year-old man. Review of echocardiographic findings with emphasis on Doppler and transesophageal echocardiography. A 74-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with congestive heart failure secondary to cor triatriatum. He also had sick sinus syndrome with complete heart block and syncope that had been treated with a permanent pacemaker 20 years earlier. The patient underwent successful surgical resection of the atrial membrane with closure of an atrial septal defect. M-mode, two-dimensional, Doppler, and transesophageal echocardiographic findings are reviewed. A unique ""spike and dome"" pattern on continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography is described that may suggest diagnosis of cor triatriatum. ",0
"Relationship among level of distraction, evoked potentials, spinal cord ischemia and integrity, and clinical status in animals. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and neurogenic-motor evoked potentials (NMEPs) were recorded after overdistraction of the spinal cord at T5-T6, T12-L1, or L3-L4. Measures of spinal cord perfusion and clinical status were also administered. Results indicated that stiffer spinal segments allowed less distraction than more flexible segments. SEPs and NMEPs were lost quickly after overdistraction in stiff segments and slowly in more flexible segments. However, SEPs were less sensitive than NMEPs to effects from overdistraction. Spinal cord perfusion and integrity were consistent with reduced perfusion and structural damage after overdistraction in stiff segments; extremely reduced perfusion but no structural changes in more flexible segments. The application of these results to the clinical situation was provided. ",0
"The internal oblique-iliac crest free flap in composite defects of the oral cavity involving bone, skin, and mucosa. The reconstruction of oromandibular defects following ablative surgery is a challenging undertaking. When the defect involves skin as well as mucosa, the challenge becomes even greater. The internal oblique iliac crest osteomyocutaneous free flap is particularly useful for reconstruction of through-and-through composite defects due to the inclusion of two separate soft-tissue flaps on the same vascular pedicle. We report our experience with this flap in the reconstruction of 10 patients with such defects. The utility, and the limitations of this form of reconstruction are discussed in detail. ",0
"Acute sensorineural deafness in Lassa fever A prospective audiometric evaluation of 69 hospitalized febrile patients in Sierra Leone, West Africa, revealed a sensorineural hearing deficit (SNHD) in 14 (29%) of 49 confirmed cases of Lassa fever and in 0 of 20 febrile controls. An SNHD was present in nine (17.6%) of 51 people who had evidence of previous Lassa virus infection. Twenty-six of 32 local residents who had previously sustained a sudden deafness had antibody titers to Lassa virus of 16 or greater, compared with six of 32 matched controls. Lassa fever is associated with an incidence of SNHD, which considerably exceeds that previously reported with any other postnatally acquired infection, and accounts for a prevalence of virus-related hearing impairment in the eastern province of Sierra Leone that is greater than that reported from anywhere else in the world.

"Experience with photocoagulation in Behcet's disease. Between 1973 and 1987 we examined both eyes of 300 patients with the uveoretinitis-type lesions characteristic of Behcet's disease. Of the 556 eyes whose fundus could be examined, 38 eyes (6.8%) in 33 patients (11%) had developed retinal capillary nonperfusion, branch retinal vein occlusion, or retinal or disc neovascularization. These eyes were treated by photocoagulation, primarily to forestall vitreous hemorrhage and the development of neovascular glaucoma, as well as to decrease the macular edema resulting from vein occlusion. The treatment, which was well tolerated, was successful in closing retinal capillary nonperfusion areas and eliminating retinal neovascularization. Disc neovascularization was resolved completely in some cases, and partially in others. ",0
"A double-masked evaluation of lignocaine-prilocaine cream (EMLA) used to alleviate the pain of retrobulbar injection A randomised, placebo controlled, double-masked study was undertaken in 115 patients undergoing cataract surgery to assess the efficacy of the anaesthetic cream EMLA (eutetic mixture of local anaesthetic, lignocaine-prilocaine) in alleviating the pain of retrobulbar injection. Sixty three patients received the EMLA cream and 52 the placebo cream. The pain was assessed objectively by the anaesthetist, who observed the reaction of the patient on needle insertion, and subjectively by the patient. Significantly lower pain scores were recorded in patients treated with EMLA cream (anaesthetist's observation: p less than 0.01, patient's assessment: p less than 0.006). No patients experienced serious side effects in either treatment group. ",0
Deterioration following delay in performing femoral angioplasty. It is not uncommon for a delay to occur between assessment arteriography and angioplasty attempt. We reviewed retrospectively the arteriograms of 61 patients where such a delay occurred to assess progression of superficial femoral artery (SFA) disease in this interval. A mean delay of 14.6 days (range 2-60 days) occurred between arteriogram and angioplasty attempt. Arteriographic deterioration was found in six of 61 patients (9.8%) and in three this precluded angioplasty. Of the six patients four had initial arteriography via the same side as the SFA disease whilst two had arteriography via the contralateral femoral approach. We discuss the aetiology of this phenomenon and suggestions are made to reduce its incidence. ,0
"Brain magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychologic evaluation of patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. We compared brain magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychologic performance in 20 neurologically asymptomatic patients suffering from idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (mean age 41 [range 18-49] years) and 20 age-matched controls (mean age 38 [range 28-49] years). Patients exhibited a significantly higher rate of cerebral infarcts (20% versus 0%, p less than 0.05) and cortical (50% versus 5%, p less than 0.01) and ventricular (55% versus 15%, p less than 0.02) atrophy than controls. Accordingly, semiquantitative volumetric measurements yielded a significantly increased ventricular-to-intracranial cavity ratio in the patients (6.2 +/- 2.9% versus 4.1 +/- 1.3%, p less than 0.01). This ratio and the cortical atrophy ratings correlated positively with disease duration (r = 0.63 and 0.54, p less than 0.05). Cognitive test performance was significantly worse in patients than in controls and was most impaired in those patients with morphologic cerebral abnormalities. ",0
"Parietal cell vagotomy and dilatation for peptic duodenal stricture. Gastric outlet obstruction due to peptic duodenal stricture (pyloric stenosis) was treated with parietal cell vagotomy and dilatation of the stricture in 32 patients. Follow-up is in the range of 5 years in 37.4% of the patients, while 6 to 10 years follow-up is available in 62.4% of the patients. At their last follow-up, 74.9% of the patients were in either Visick 1 or 2 clinical status. Recurrence rates have been 3.1% at 1 year, 9.3% at 5 years, and 21.8% after 6 to 10 years follow-up. There has been only one instance (3.1%) of restenosis. Two patients required reoperation because of recurrence and one of them died. ",0
"Trends in conserving treatment of invasive carcinoma of the breast in females. This population-based study presents trends in the treatment of node-negative invasive carcinoma of the breast in females during the 1980s in the Detroit metropolitan area. It was done to determine whether or not there has been a significant shift toward conservation of the breast from 1980 to 1987. Trend analyses of surgical treatment, tumor size, node status, year of diagnosis, age and race were performed for 13,217 patients drawn from the Metropolitan Detroit Cancer Surveillance System. A significant increase in the use of conserving the breast was observed, with younger women receiving this treatment option more often than older women. Implications for a continuing shift in the biologic findings and treatment of carcinoma of the breast are discussed. ",0
"The effect of omental pedicle graft transfer on spinal microcirculation and laminectomy membrane formation. The properties of the omentum and its effect on spinal neurologic disease was investigated. Omental pedicle grafts were transferred to the laminectomized lumbar spines of nine neurologically normal dogs. Grafts were placed on either the dura or the spinal cord. Interruption of the graft's circulation was examined. To study the effect, the artery of the graft was injected with contrast and the graft-dura interface studied histologically. All injected specimens demonstrated vascular connections from the graft to the neural elements. The graft was found to decrease postoperative perineural scarring. The omentum appears to possess properties that could be applied to improve outcomes in spinal surgery. ",0
"Successful liver transplantation in a patient with a thrombosed portomesenteric system after multiple failed shunts. Combined portal and mesenteric vein thrombosis preventing restoration of adequate portal venous flow has been considered a contraindication to liver transplantation. We report a patient with failed splenorenal (SR), portocaval (PC), and mesocaval (MC) shunts, who despite the absence of any obvious means for supplying portal venous inflow to a hepatic graft, successfully underwent orthotopic liver transplantation. A method of reconstruction of the portal vein with the use of vein grafts anastomosed to a large splanchnic venous collateral is described. This technique can be used in selected patients in whom orthotopic liver transplantation might otherwise be considered technically impossible. ",0
"Late relapse with nodular lymphoma after treatment for diffuse non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Histologic conversion from a low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) into a more aggressive histologic pattern is a common, well-documented event in NHL. The converse phenomenon, appearance of a low-grade, follicular NHL after treatment for diffuse, intermediate, or high-grade NHL, has only recently been recognized. The clinical, morphologic, and immunologic features of a patient in whom relapse with an indolent nodular lymphoma was noticed after combination chemotherapy for diffuse lymphoma are presented. Immunologic markers at presentation and relapse were similar. Other previously reported cases are reviewed. Implications for diagnosis and therapy as well as the pathogenesis of this unique form of conversion are discussed. ",0
"The freckle sign--an endoscopic feature of the cecum. Mucosal spots, or ""freckles,"" surrounding the appendiceal orifice are an endoscopic feature of the cecum. These are clusters of 1 to 2 mm round or oval slightly raised spots, each with a pale center and an erythematous border. They correlate microscopically with subepithelial and submucosal lymphoid follicles. The freckling pattern, identified in about one third of colonoscopies, was seen best with the videoendoscope and was identified more commonly in patients with systemic illness. Recognition of mucosal freckling around the appendiceal orifice helps identify the cecum and may be useful in the evaluation of cecal and appendiceal pathology. ",0
"Lipolytic factors associated with murine and human cancer cachexia. We have identified a lipolytic factor in extracts of a cachexia-inducing murine carcinoma (MAC16) that shows characteristics of an acidic peptide and appears to be composed of three fractions of apparent molecular weights corresponding to 3 kd, 1.5 kd, and 0.7 kd, as determined by exclusion chromatography. Material with identical chromatographic and molecular weight characteristics was also present in the serum of patients with clinical cancer cachexia but absent from normal serum, even under conditions of starvation. The MAC16 lipid factor, when injected into animals bearing the non-cachexia-inducing tumor MAC13, was capable of inducing weight loss without a significant reduction in food intake. Similar lipolytic material, although in lower concentration, was also found in the MAC13 tumor extracts. These findings suggest that cachexia may arise from the enhanced expression of a lipolytic factor associated with tumor cells. ",0
"Molteno implants and operating microscope-induced retinal phototoxicity. A clinicopathologic report. The right eye of a 75-year-old man with a history of cataract extraction, three penetrating keratoplasties, laser trabeculoplasty, two Molteno implants, and an operating microscope-induced retinal phototoxic lesion was studied post mortem. Histopathologic examination of the anterior segment showed evidence of penetrating keratoplasty, cataract surgery, and two Molteno implants with minimal associated tissue response. Ultrastructural examination showed a loose collagenous matrix surrounding the Molteno reservoirs, suggesting aqueous percolation from the reservoirs into the conjunctiva. Posteriorly, in the area of the phototoxic operating microscope-induced lesion, a nodule of retinal pigment epithelial hyperplasia with overlying atrophy of the photoreceptor cell layer of the neurosensory retina was noted. The retina also contained cystoid macular edema and an extensive preretinal membrane that was clinically unexpected. ",0
"Otitis media in day-care children. A report from the International Primary Care Network. The relationship between day care and acute otitis media and its adverse consequences was analyzed as part of a collaborative multinational study. Data from primary care research networks in eight countries were collected on 1335 children, aged 0 to 60 months, at the time of initial visits to their primary care physicians for acute otitis media. A history of recurrent acute otitis media, poor hearing, and tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy were all more frequent in day-care children aged 25 to 60 months, compared with those cared for at home. Day-care children were brought to their physicians more promptly after the onset of symptoms and received more referrals to otolaryngologists at the time of the index visit for acute otitis media. Day care may pose a significant risk for otitis media and its adverse consequences. ",0
"Micromotion of cemented and uncemented femoral components. We evaluated the initial stability of cemented and uncemented femoral components within the femoral canals of cadaver femurs during simulated single limb stance and stair climbing. Both types were very stable in simulated single limb stance (maximum micromotion of 42 microns for cemented and 30 microns for uncemented components). However, in simulated stair climbing, the cemented components were much more stable than the uncemented components (76 microns as against 280 microns). There was also greater variation in the stability of uncemented components in simulated stair climbing, with two of the seven components moving 200 microns or more. Future implant designs should aim to improve the initial stability of cementless femoral components under torsional loads; this should improve the chances of bony ingrowth. ",0
"Posterior transfer of the adductors in children who have cerebral palsy. A long-term study. Seventy-eight posterior transfers of the adductors of the hip in forty-two children who has spastic cerebral palsy were reviewed an average of 5.7 years after the operation (range, two to 14.6 years). The results were assessed on the basis of the patient's ability to walk, the range of motion of the affected hip or hips, and the radiographic measurements. In 88 per cent of the patients, the transfer was successful in improving or maintaining abduction, extension, functional walking, and stability of the hip. The failures were all in patients who were unable to walk and who had spastic quadriplegia. Tenotomy of the iliopsoas tendon at the time of the transfer procedure resulted in an improved range of motion of the hip. ",0
"Amebic meningoencephalitis in a patient with AIDS caused by a newly recognized opportunistic pathogen. Leptomyxid ameba. A fatal case of meningoencephalitis due to a leptomyxid ameba in a patient with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is presented. This opportunistic organism has not been previously recognized as a human pathogen. A 36-year-old male intravenous drug abuser died after an 18-day hospital course heralded by fever and headache and followed by nuchal rigidity and hemiparesis. Computed tomography of the head showed multiple hypodense lesions. Neuropathologic examination showed that in addition to human immunodeficiency virus encephalomyelitis, there was multifocal meningoencephalitis with trophozoites and cysts morphologically indistinguishable from those of Acanthamoeba. These organisms were also found in the kidneys and adrenal glands. By immunofluorescence, the parasites showed antigenic identity with a free-living leptomyxid ameba and failed to react with any of a spectrum of antiacanthamoeba antisera. This emphasizes the importance of immunofluorescence identification of morphologically indistinguishable ameba species. ",0
"Multiple noncontiguous spine fractures. The data from a prospective study of 508 spine injuries were reviewed to determine the incidence of multiple noncontiguous spine fractures. All patients were examined at admission and at 1 and 2 years postinjury. This series identified 77 (15.2%) multilevel fractures. Motor vehicle accidents were the primary cause of these fractures. The incidence of neurologic injury was not significantly different between multiple noncontiguous and single fractures. Failure to use seat belts and ejection from the vehicle were the main factors associated with multiple noncontiguous spine injuries. Seven major fracture patterns were identified, which accounted for 60% of these injuries. The prognosis for multilevel spine fractures was not significantly worse that that for single-level injuries.

"Sequential esophageal motility studies after endoscopic injection sclerotherapy: a prospective investigation. To assess prospectively the effects of endoscopic intravariceal sclerosis (EIS) on esophageal function, we performed esophageal manometry on 13 cirrhotic patients before EIS, 24 h after the second session and 4 wk after the fourth session. EIS had no impact on lower esophageal sphincter pressure. However, a significant decrease in the amplitude of peristaltic waves was observed immediately post-EIS in the lower two-thirds of the esophagus. There was no modification of duration or velocity of progression of peristaltic waves. A four-fold increase in simultaneous contractions was observed early after EIS. These changes were reversible, as assessed by late esophageal testing after EIS. No correlations were demonstrated between esophageal motor parameters and doses of sclerosant. We conclude that sclerosant injection into the esophageal wall acutely impairs esophageal motility, but motor function is partially restored 4 wk after completion of EIS, suggesting that dysmotility is reversible.

"Risk of cancer death in first-degree relatives of patients with hereditary non-polyposis cancer syndrome (Lynch type II): a study of 130 kindreds in the United Kingdom. To estimate the relative risks of cancer in first-degree relatives of index patients, 130 pedigrees of dominantly inherited Lynch type II cancer family syndrome have been analysed. The risk of death from all causes was significantly increased in women over 45 years of age and the overall liability to cancer in women was greater than for men. A sevenfold increase in risk of colon cancer was found in both sexes. In female relatives the risk of breast cancer was increased fivefold and lifetime risk of breast cancer was 1 in 3.7. A screening programme based on estimated risks could be offered to first-degree relatives of index patients with Lynch type II cancer family syndrome. ",0
"Managing geriatric arrhythmias, II: Drug selection and use [published erratum appears in Geriatrics 1991 Jun;46(6):100] Age-related impairments in antiarrhythmic drug distribution, metabolism, and excretion may result in accumulation of these potent drugs, increasing the risk of adverse drug reactions and drug interactions in the elderly. These risks are minimized by using modest initial dosage with slow dosage titration. Therapeutic drug monitoring is a method which employs antiarrhythmic concentration data and a determination of drug clearance in order to develop an optimal dosing regimen. The pharmacology, indications for use, and adverse effects of currently available antiarrhythmics are reviewed. Dosing guidelines for the geriatric population are provided. ",0
"Hashimoto's encephalopathy: a steroid-responsive disorder associated with high anti-thyroid antibody titers--report of 5 cases. We describe 5 patients with a relapsing encephalopathy in association with Hashimoto's disease and high titers of anti-thyroid antibodies. The presentation is usually with a subacute onset of confusion, alteration in conscious level, and focal or generalized seizures. The relapsing course, association with myoclonus or tremulousness, and episodes of stroke-like deterioration are characteristic features. The long-term prognosis is favorable with steroid therapy, though additional immunosuppressive therapy may be required. Neurologic investigation typically shows a diffusely abnormal EEG, high CSF protein level without pleocytosis, and normal brain CT and cerebral angiogram. Isotope brain scan may show patchy abnormal uptake. Hashimoto's encephalopathy should be recognized as a definite neurologic entity and added to the list of CNS complications of thyroid disease. ",0
"Cholecystokinin enhanced hepatobiliary scanning with ejection fraction calculation as an indicator of disease of the gallbladder. Chronic acalculous cholecystitis represents 5 to 20 per cent of electively treated diseases of the gallbladder. A 70 per cent success rate in relieving these patients of chronic pain was reported when surgical treatment was recommended based on symptoms alone. The cholecystokinin ejection fraction, which is a quantitative measure of emptying of the gallbladder, was 95 per cent accurate in predicting which patients would be relieved of symptoms by surgical treatment. In this study, we report our consecutive experience during a 20 month period with 83 patients. ",0
"A cellist with arm pain: thermal asymmetry in scalenus anticus syndrome. We report on a cellist with pain and coldness of the upper extremity. Abnormal thermographic studies were instrumental in uncovering intermittent compression of the subclavian artery, and this prompted us to study the effects of cello playing on skin temperature asymmetry. Temperature asymmetry was defined as the temperature difference (delta-T) from one hand to the other. In 57 controls, mean delta-T at rest was .309 +/- .254C. Exercising the upper extremities by prolonged elbow flexion or by movements mimicking cello playing in controls did not significantly affect delta-T. In our patient, delta-T was ten times control (3.6C). Angiography showed extrinsic compression of the subclavian artery occurring only after cello playing; sympathetic ganglion block relieved the pain. Our patient's abnormal skin temperature may have reflected sympathetic vasomotor hyperactivity. Intermittent neurovascular compression and sympathetic hyperactivity appear to be factors in scalenus anticus syndrome. ",0
"Massive allografts in salvage revisions of failed total knee arthroplasties. Ten patients with failed total knee arthroplasties and severe bone loss were treated with massive whole distal femur and proximal tibial allografts in combination with prosthetic implants. Fourteen allografts were inserted either as invaginated or segmental grafts and were rigidly fixed to the host bone. Clinically and roentgenographically, 12 of 14 grafts (86%) seemed to have united to the host bone. The average range of motion was 92 degrees. Five patients developed complications; two of these involved the allograft (nonunion and fracture) and two were caused by inadequate healing at the ligament-allograft junction. One patient had a late infection. With careful planning and improved surgical techniques, these complications can be avoided. The massive allograft-prosthesis composite techniques is a viable reconstructive alternative worthy of further clinical trials. ",0
"Controlled trial of antimycobacterial therapy in Crohn's disease. Clofazimine versus placebo. In order to study the effect of clofazimine, a powerful antimycobacterial and antiinflammatory agent, 49 patients with active Crohn's disease were randomized to either corticosteroids plus clofazimine 100 mg daily (N = 25) or to steroids and matching placebo (N = 24). A total of 28 patients (58%) went into disease remission (clofazimine 16, placebo 12; P = NS) with a fall in disease activity score from 10.5 +/- 4.4 to 3.3 +/- 3.5. Patients were treated for a further eight months with clofazimine or placebo and 18 of 28 maintained their remission and completed the study (clofazimine 12, placebo 6; P = NS). Side effects were minor and consisted of skin rash and increased pigmentation. Clofazimine as a solitary antimycobacterial agent appears ineffective in inducing remission in Crohn's disease but may have a role in either disease maintenance or combination chemotherapy. ",0
"Blue breath holding is benign. In their recent publication in this journal, Southall et al described typical cyanotic breath holding spells, both in otherwise healthy children and in those with brainstem lesions and other malformations. Their suggestions regarding possible autonomic disturbances may require further study, but they have adduced no scientific evidence to contradict the accepted view that in the intact child blue breath holding spells are benign. Those families in which an infant suffers an 'apparently life threatening event' deserve immense understanding and help, and it behoves investigators to exercise extreme care and self criticism in the presentation of new knowledge which may bear upon their management and their morale.

Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction presenting as ascites: the importance of clinically assessing central venous pressure. A 66-year-old man without history of heart disease or symptoms of left ventricular (LV) failure was admitted with transudative ascites. Echocardiography showed no valvular or pericardial disease and normal LV function. Gated pool scintigraphy confirmed normal LV systolic function but demonstrated severe right ventricular systolic dysfunction. Catheterization revealed left ventricular diastolic dysfunction as the cause of right-sided failure. The clinician evaluating transudative ascites cannot exclude LV failure on the basis of noninvasive assessment of systolic function alone. Appreciation of an elevated central venous pressure remains the most important evidence of a cardiac source of ascites. ,0
"Excitatory amino acids in the developing brain: ontogeny, plasticity, and excitotoxicity. Besides their role as neurotransmitters, excitatory amino acids (EAAs) in the developing brain are crucially involved in plasticity and excitotoxicity which are modified by their distinct ontogeny. Along with incomplete neuritogenesis and synaptogenesis, presynaptic markers of the EAA system are immature in the developing brain; however, postsynaptic EAA system activities, particularly of the N-methyl-D-aspartate and quisqualate receptors, are transiently enhanced early in life. This transient enhancement is presumably beneficial to the immature brain because physiologic activation of the EAA system plays a critical role in plasticity of early learning and morphogenesis. At the same time, this transient hypersensitivity renders the immature brain vulnerable to pathologic excitation of the EAA system (excitotoxicity) as observed during neonatal hypoxia-ischemia. ",0
"Fresnel prisms improve visual perception in stroke patients with homonymous hemianopia or unilateral visual neglect. We randomly assigned 39 patients with stroke and homonymous hemianopia or unilateral visual neglect to treatment with 15-diopter plastic press-on Fresnel prisms (n = 18) or to serve as controls (n = 21). Baseline evaluations of visual perception and activities-of-daily-living (ADL) function were similar for both groups. After 4 weeks, the prism-treated group performed significantly better than controls on the following: (1) Motor Free Visual Perception Test; (2) Line Bisection Task; (3) Line Cancellation Task; (4) Harrington Flocks Visual Field Screener; and (5) Tangent Screen Examination. There was no significant difference in Barthel ADL assessment at 4 weeks. Thus, treatment with 15-diopter Fresnel prisms improves visual perception test scores but not ADL function in stroke patients with homonymous hemianopia or unilateral visual neglect. ",0
"Adjunctive use of beta-adrenergic blockers, calcium antagonists and other therapies in coronary thrombolysis. The availability of thrombolytic agents for use in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction is an important step in the management of a common, often debilitating, and potentially lethal disorder. However, despite the proven benefits of coronary thrombolysis, the importance of adjunctive treatment modalities is being increasingly recognized. Beta-adrenergic blockers, calcium antagonists, nitrates, magnesium, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors each exert favorable cardiovascular properties that may offer additional benefits. Clinical trials combining thrombolytic and adjunctive pharmacologic agents offer hope for further advances in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction. ",0
"Relationship among level of distraction, evoked potentials, spinal cord ischemia and integrity, and clinical status in animals. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and neurogenic-motor evoked potentials (NMEPs) were recorded after overdistraction of the spinal cord at T5-T6, T12-L1, or L3-L4. Measures of spinal cord perfusion and clinical status were also administered. Results indicated that stiffer spinal segments allowed less distraction than more flexible segments. SEPs and NMEPs were lost quickly after overdistraction in stiff segments and slowly in more flexible segments. However, SEPs were less sensitive than NMEPs to effects from overdistraction. Spinal cord perfusion and integrity were consistent with reduced perfusion and structural damage after overdistraction in stiff segments; extremely reduced perfusion but no structural changes in more flexible segments. The application of these results to the clinical situation was provided. ",0
"Perianal appearances associated with constipation. The perianal appearances were studied prospectively of 136 constipated children (mean age 3.9 years, 67 boys, 69 girls). Anal dilatation, fissures, tags, warts, perianal oedema, redness, blueness, and veins were recorded. It was noted whether dilatation occurred immediately or at 30 and 60 seconds with the buttocks minimally separated, and on subsequent firm lateral traction of the buttocks. The degree of faecal loading was assessed in all children. Anal dilatation was found in 24 (18%) and first appeared on lateral traction in eight (6%). In three quarters of the children with dilatation faecal loading or perianal signs were present. Fissures were found in 35 (26%) children and tags in seven (5%). Perianal redness was more likely to be associated with fissures, and blueness with dilatation. We conclude that there are no pathognomonic perianal signs in childhood constipation and that the technique of anal examination should be standardised. ",0
"Fluorometric determination of pseudocholinesterase activity in postmortem blood samples. A fluorometric assay using 3-(p-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid (HPPA) was conducted to determine the activity of pseudocholinesterase (ChE) [Enzyme Commission (EC) No. 3.1.1.8] in postmortem blood samples so as to test for organophosphate poisoning. By the enzymatic reaction of ChE, its substrate, benzoylcholine, produces choline, which is oxidized by choline oxidase to generate hydrogen peroxide. HPPA is oxidized by hydrogen peroxide and peroxidase to become the fluorogenic dimer whose concentration is measured fluorometrically at an excitation emission wavelength of 320 nm and an elimination emission wavelength of 404 nm. The selectivity and sensitivity of the present method were found to be superior to those of conventional pH and spectrophotometric methods. ",0
"Intravenous but not intracolonic epidermal growth factor maintains colonocyte proliferation in defunctioned rat colorectum. The role of epidermal growth factor in the proliferation of normal and premalignant colonocytes in vivo is not fully understood. In particular, the relative importance of its possible systemic and intraluminal routes of action has not been fully clarified. Rats with surgically defunctioned distal colorectums were used, and mini osmotic pumps were implanted to study the effects of intraluminal and IV administration of epidermal growth factor on colonocyte proliferation. Within 2 weeks of bypass, colonocyte proliferation in defunctioned colorectum has decreased to about one third the rate in normal colorectum or in colorectum proximal to the defunctioning colostomy. Intraluminal epidermal growth factor, infused from the time of operation did not reverse this hypoplasia, whereas IV epidermal growth factor maintained colonocyte proliferation at approximately the normal rate in bypassed colorectum. This model is suitable for testing other putative colonic mitogens for possible intraluminal and systemic effects. ",0
"Endoscopic ventricular fenestration using a ""saline torch"". The fiberoptic endoscope has never gained popularity among neurosurgeons although it is ideally suited for navigating within the cerebral ventricles. Recent advances in optics and miniaturization make the application of endoscopy in neurosurgery more practical. The authors report eight children who underwent ventriculoscopic fenestration of symptomatic loculated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collections. These CSF collections were either isolated ventricular cysts or trapped lateral ventricles secondary to obstruction at the foramen of Monro. Cyst wall dissection was carried out with a ""saline torch"" dissector which was introduced through a working channel in the ventriculoscope. The torch was used to coagulate vessels and to sculpt large windows in cyst walls or in the septum pellucidum. Ventriculoscope-guided cyst fenestration can be performed safely and easily under direct vision. The technique may permit simplification of shunt systems in some patients and elimination of shunts in others. ",0
"Wound infection following early repeat sternotomy for postoperative bleeding. An experience utilizing intraoperative irrigation with povidone iodine. A prospective observational study of median sternotomy wound infection was carried out in two consecutive groups of unselected patients undergoing early repeat sternotomy for postoperative haemorrhage. In Group A the pericardial cavity and sternotomy wound layers were irrigated with aqueous povidone iodine prior to repeat closure, while Group B did not receive povidone iodine. No median sternotomy infections were recorded in Group A compared to 5 cases in Group B (0 out of 22 vs 5 out of 21 patients, p less than 0.05). Amongst the patients with wound infection, three developed sternal dehiscence and mediastinitis with one death. The data suggests that povidone iodine irrigation may be effective in reducing wound infection in patients undergoing early repeat sternotomy after cardiac surgery. ",0
"Relaxation training in school classes does not reduce headache complaints. The effect of teacher-presented Progressive Relaxation Training (PRT) on headaches, fear of failure and school problems was studied in school students. During ten physical education lessons, students received either PRT (n = 110) or placebo training (n = 92). The effect of the training was investigated in students who indicated the presence of headaches in a pre-training diary. No significant differences were found between both training groups regarding headache frequency, duration and intensity and the psychological variables. On the basis of these and previous findings, it is recommended to present PRT to fairly small groups of self-selected subjects instead of complete classes. ",0
"Complications of general anesthesia for Nd:YAG laser resection of endobronchial tumors. We studied the incidence and mechanisms of cardiovascular complications and postoperative respiratory insufficiency associated with GA and Nd:YAG laser endobronchial tumor resection. The records of 73 patients undergoing 87 procedures were reviewed. Preoperative status, anesthetic methods and perioperative complications were analyzed by multiple regression to determine predictors of outcome. Twenty-three percent of patients had greater than 90 percent mainstem bronchus obstruction. Longer serum elimination half-life of relaxant drug was significantly correlated with longer duration of mechanical ventilation after neuromuscular blockade reversal. Cardiovascular complications were noted in 24 procedures and often required therapeutic intervention. Variables predicting cardiovascular complications included longer duration of GA and increasing age. Perioperative respiratory and cardiovascular complications are common after GA for Nd: YAG laser resection. Short-acting neuromuscular relaxants, careful assessment prior to postoperative extubation, limiting duration of GA and cardiovascular monitoring are recommended when implementing GA for Nd: YAG laser resection of endobronchial tumors.

"Natural history and cardiac manifestations of homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia. Forty-nine patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (diagnosed on the basis of family history, xanthomatosis, total serum cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein receptor status) were studied over a period of 13 years, and underwent cardiovascular assessment. Eleven died, nine of myocardial infarction. Seven underwent coronary artery bypass, and another five had surgery to relieve supravalvular and valvular aortic stenosis. A distinctive pattern of disease was noted. Coronary ostial stenosis (four patients) and aortic root stenosis (six patients), both consequences of aortic root cholesterol deposition, were the typical manifestations of heart disease in childhood and adolescence. Adults developed severe coronary artery disease with a high incidence of main stem lesions (four of five patients). Surgery provided effective treatment for coronary artery disease and aortic outflow tract stenosis. Overall survival appeared to be better than reported in other studies which may reflect the 'receptor-defective' status of this group of patients. ",0
"Radiation necrosis of the optic chiasm, optic tract, hypothalamus, and upper pons after radiotherapy for pituitary adenoma, detected by gadolinium-enhanced, T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging: case report. A 26-year-old woman was treated for a prolactin secreting pituitary adenoma by surgery and radiotherapy (5860 rads). Fourteen months later, she developed right hemiparesis and dysarthria. A T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scan using gadolinium contrast showed a small, enhanced lesion in the upper pons. Seven months later, she had a sudden onset of loss of vision, and radiation optic neuropathy was diagnosed. A T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scan showed widespread gadolinium-enhanced lesions in the optic chiasm, optic tract, and hypothalamus. Magnetic resonance imaging is indispensable for the early diagnosis of radiation necrosis, which is not visualized by radiography or computed tomography. ",0
"Pancreatic ascites: treatment by continuous somatostatin infusion. Two male patients with recurrent acute pancreatitis due to alcohol abuse were admitted with pancreatic ascites (high concentration of amylase, raised protein concentration, no specific cytologic features). Ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) confirmed gross ascites and inflammation of the pancreas in both patients, and a pseudocyst in the head of the pancreas in one of them. Treatment with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and a H2-blocking agent was instituted and continued for 4 and 2 wk, respectively. Due to lack of improvement, somatostatin infusion (250 micrograms/h) was started. During the next few days, there was a rapid improvement of the clinical status, and the production of ascites ceased. We conclude that somatostatin infusion should be tried before any invasive diagnostic or therapeutic intervention in patients with pancreatic ascites. ",0
"Management of posterior urethral strictures secondary to pelvic fractures in children. Bulboprostatic anastomotic urethroplasty was performed in 20 children with posterior urethral strictures secondary to bony pelvic fractures. The approach was perineal in 4 children and transpubic abdominoperineal in 16, with good postoperative results in 100 and 62.5%, respectively. In some children the urethral disruption occurred within the prostate itself and not at the prostatomembranous junction. In such cases the proximal sphincteric mechanism may be at risk and immediate repair of the injury is advisable. In the case of common prostatomembranous disruption displacement of the urethra may be significant. In such cases a transpubic approach is preferable. If the proximal sphincteric mechanism is deranged, it can be managed at the same time. ",0
"Acupuncture and chronic pain: a criteria-based meta-analysis. A literature search revealed 51 controlled clinical studies on the effectiveness of acupuncture in chronic pain. These studies were reviewed using a list of 18 predefined methodological criteria. A maximum of 100 points for study design could be earned in four main categories: (a) comparability of prognosis, (b) adequate intervention, (c) adequate effect measurement and (d) data presentation. The quality of even the better studies proved to be mediocre. No study earned more than 62% of the maximum score. The results from the better studies (greater than or equal to 50% of the maximum score) are highly contradictory. The efficacy of acupuncture in the treatment of chronic pain remains doubtful. ",0
"Carcinoma of the pancreas: a retrospective review. Eighty-five patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were reviewed in order to evaluate the efficacy of our methods of diagnosis and treatment. The most useful diagnostic test was percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) with a diagnostic rate of 96%. Pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure) and total pancreatic resection were performed in 13 and 2 patients, respectively. The remaining 50 patients underwent various palliative drainage procedures. Twenty patients did not undergo operation for various reasons. The primary tumor was found in the head of the pancreas in 50 patients (59%), the body in 6 patients (7%), and in the tail in 8 patients (9%). Postoperative complications, including sepsis, bleeding, intra-abdominal abscesses, and anastomotic leaks, occurred in 37% of the patients. There were one operative and 9 postoperative deaths. The average survival for those patients undergoing surgical intervention was 6 months. There were no 5-year survivors. ",0
"Acute respiratory tract infection in children in Idikan Community, Ibadan, Nigeria: severity, risk factors, and frequency of occurrence. A longitudinal, community-based study of the epidemiology of acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) in children less than 5 years old was carried out in a community of low socioeconomic level in Ibadan, Nigeria. The annual incidence of ARI ranged from 6.1 to 8.1 episodes per child per year. The incidence was highest in the first 2 years of life and decreased with increasing age. The incidence was higher in boys than in girls. ARI occurred in all seasons of the year. The most common symptoms were cough, nasal discharge, and fever, while the most common signs referable to the respiratory tract were abnormal breathing sounds, tachypnea, and chest retraction. ",0
"Achieving pH control in the critically ill patient: the role of continuous infusion of H2-receptor antagonists. Stress-related gastric mucosal damage is a common occurrence in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Because of the significant morbidity and mortality associated with this mucosal damage, many ICU patients routinely receive prophylactic therapy, usually with histamine H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs). Gastric acid secretion occurs in a circadian pattern, with late afternoon and evening surges. H2RAs by continuous infusion may control this uneven pattern of secretion more effectively than H2RAs given by bolus injection. More studies are needed to identify the target ICU population for prophylactic treatment. ",0
"Obstructing carcinoma of the cecum. Carcinoma of the cecum, the third most common location for malignancy of the large bowel, was examined with attention centered upon cecal cancers producing obstruction. Reviewing 136 patients revealed 11 obstructing lesions (8.1%) presenting as distal small bowel obstructions. The mean age of the patients was 74 years. All but one patient had resection for cure which consisted of a right hemicolectomy with ileotransverse colostomy. There was no operative mortality or significant morbidity. Bowel obstruction due to cecal carcinoma is an infrequent occurrence arising in elderly patients and carries a poor survival rate due to advanced disease at the time of diagnosis and treatment. ",0
"Unusually late onset of cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea after head trauma. Two cases of acute meningitis and cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea, in which the head trauma responsible occurred 10 and 30 years before, are presented. Intraoperatively, the brain parenchyma was found to be plugged into the fractured anterior fossa. By debridement and duraplasty from an intradural approach, both patients were cured. Several precipitating factors could be responsible for this unusually late reopening of the fistula. The possible accidental causes could be coughing or undetected microtraumas, but in the long run, atrophy of tissues and consequent changes in brain compliance with aging may play a role. ",0
"Monomorphic adenomas of the major salivary glands: clinicopathological study of 44 cases. We report 44 cases of monomorphic adenoma (MA) of the major salivary glands observed during the years 1979-1989. All of these tumours were reviewed and classified on the basis of the World Health Organisation (WHO) criteria. Histological type, site, sex and age were considered. 34 cases of adenolymphoma were observed, all of them located in the parotid glands; 10 MA without lymphoid stroma were located in both parotid and submandibular glands. Distinctive histological and clinico-pathological features of the latter group of tumours are discussed, as well as the diagnostic criteria in distinguishing these tumours from pleomorphic adenoma and adenoid-cystic carcinoma.

"Questionable role of CNS radioprophylaxis in the therapeutic management of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma with meningeal extension. A series of 15 consecutive children with head and neck nonorbital rhabdomyosarcoma (RMSA) with meningeal extension were prospectively treated with chemotherapy consisting of Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratory, Columbus, OH) (ADM), vincristine (VCR), cyclophosphamide (CPM), and dactinomycin (DACT) followed by radiotherapy (60 Gy) to the primary tumor volume, along with intrathecal methotrexate (IT MTX). Thirteen of 15 responded to preradiation chemotherapy. Four of 13 relapsed. Relapse occurred at the level of the primary tumor in three of four. The 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 59%, similar to that achieved in a previous series treated with a comparable therapeutic approach that also included whole-brain radiotherapy as a prophylaxis of possible occult meningeal seeding. It is concluded that CNS prophylaxis with radiotherapy is questionable in the management of childhood RMSA with meningeal extension. ",0
"Role of ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration biopsy in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. In 170 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, ultrasound showed a high sensitivity in identifying focal liver lesions. Fine needle aspiration biopsy guided by ultrasound yielded a pathological diagnosis in the majority of cases. The advantages of this technique, its high diagnostic yield and low cost, render the older technique of blind percutaneous biopsy using a coarse needle obsolete. Laparoscopy retains its essential role in selected cases. Complementary use of fine needle aspiration biopsy under ultrasound guidance and laparoscopy assures the highest rate of diagnostic accuracy in hepatocellular carcinoma. We confirm the poor sensitivity of alpha fetoprotein. ",0
"Hyperglycemia presenting with occipital seizures. Seizures are common in hyperglycemia and are often the first manifestation, particularly in nonketotic hyperglycemia (NKH). Published reports emphasize partial motor seizures almost exclusively. In a 3-year period, we observed three patients in whom occipital seizures, documented by ictal EEG recording, were the initial symptom of hyperglycemia. One patient was mildly ketotic at first. Seizures were visual in two patients and visual and adversive in the third. Seizures regressed with correction of abnormal glucose levels and did not recur during follow-up of less than or equal to 1 year despite discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in two. Computed tomography (CT) scans did not show correlative abnormalities. Although published reports suggest that frontal lobe structures are particularly susceptible to the epileptogenic effects of NKH, our experience indicates that in NKH epileptic foci may originate in other cortical areas, such as occipital.

"Propranolol and the morning increase in sudden cardiac death: (the beta-blocker heart attack trial experience). To provide insight into the protective effect of propranolol on mortality after myocardial infarction observed in the beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial, the time of occurrence of sudden cardiac death was examined in this population. Between 5 A.M. and 11 A.M., 25 of the 56 total deaths (38%) occurred in the placebo patients compared with 11 of 45 (24%) in the propranolol patients. Excluding this period, there were nearly equal numbers of sudden cardiac deaths in the propranolol and placebo groups. This retrospective analysis suggests that beta blockade is protective during the morning hours when a surge of sympathetic activity may increase the risk of sudden cardiac death. ",0
"Labetalol and MRI as initial medical and diagnostic modalities in a marfanoid patient with expanding ascending aortic aneurysm. Marfan syndrome is a hereditable disorder of connective tissue that causes several distinct cardiovascular abnormalities, including aortic regurgitation, dissection, and aneurysm. These cardiac manifestations can be identified with echocardiography, computer tomography, and angiography. Standard treatment of an acute hypertensive crisis in Marfan syndrome uses propranolol and sodium nitroprusside. This patient with Marfan syndrome whose case is reported herein presented with chest pain, hypertensive crisis, and aortic insufficiency; labetalol was used successfully to treat the acute hypertensive crisis and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to differentiate between aortic dissection and an expanding aortic aneurysm. This report is unique in that labetalol was used to control the hypertensive crisis in Marfan syndrome and MRI was used as the initial diagnostic modality in an emergency setting. ",0
"Oral diseases in older adults [clinical conference] In the case presented, a 65-year-old man with multiple dental, medical, and social problems benefited from interdisciplinary assessment and treatment. Despite his poor oral-health status and oral-health behaviors upon admission, patient education and dental therapy resulted in improved daily oral hygiene, elimination of oral diseases, and improved oral function. The overall quality of life of any individual, particularly an older one, can be enhanced through oral-disease prevention, health promotion, and, when indicated, dental therapy. This patient was treated in a hospital environment with a well-established team approach to geriatric care. However, regardless of the care setting, the physician can play a key role in improving the oral health status and quality of life of older adults by including an oral screening examination as part of the periodic comprehensive geriatric assessment, recognizing oral pathology, requesting dental consultations and encouraging appropriate dental service utilization.

"Spontaneous perinephric hemorrhage: imaging and management. We report on 10 patients with spontaneous perinephric hemorrhage associated with underlying disease, including renal cell carcinoma (5), angiomyolipoma (2), malignant melanoma (1), periarteritis nodosa (1) and severe portal hypertension (1). The etiology could not be identified with computerized tomography (CT) in 5 cases (50%), including 2 renal cell carcinomas, 1 angiomyolipoma, 1 periarteritis nodosa and 1 portal hypertension. Arteriography demonstrated underlying lesions in 4 of these 5 cases (80%) including the case of vasculitis. CT combined with magnetic resonance imaging is accurate for the diagnosis of spontaneous perinephric hemorrhage but the underlying pathological condition is often undetectable in the acute phase due to the perinephric blood. CT should be the first study performed if this diagnosis is suspected. Arteriography is recommended if a renal mass is not detected. If a mass is not identified with these 2 imaging studies and the patient is clinically stable, followup thin slice CT should be performed. ",0
"Fast short-tau inversion-recovery MR imaging. To enhance the versatility of the short-tau inversion-recovery (STIR) sequences, the authors determined a range of repetition time (TR) and inversion time (TI) combinations that suppress signal intensity from fat by study of both patient and phantom images. To make fast STIR images, variations in the following pulsing conditions were studied with use of an interactive computer program: decreasing the TR, limiting the number of excitations, and limiting the number of phase-encoding steps. The authors found that (a) STIR imaging need not be time consuming, (b) fat suppression can be accomplished at shorter TR by using shorter TI, and (c) short-TR fast STIR imaging is sensitive to enhancement with gadopentetate dimeglumine.

"Treatment of duodenitis with cimetidine: a clinical, endoscopic, and histologic study. We studied the effectiveness of cimetidine in the treatment of endoscopically diagnosed duodenitis. Sixty-nine patients with the solitary endoscopic finding of duodenitis (6% of 1,200 patients who underwent fiberoptic endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal tract in our unit over 3 years) were studied retrospectively: a good clinical response was apparent in 45 of 69 patients treated with cimetidine (65%), and a fair response in another four (6%). In a controlled, randomized prospective study, we evaluated the effectiveness of cimetidine in duodenitis. Statistically significant improvement for the clinical and endoscopic scores was found in 10 patients treated with cimetidine (p less than 0.01). Improvement in the histologic score did not reach statistical significance. No such improvement was demonstrated in seven placebo-treated patients. We believe that duodenitis is a ""peptic syndrome,"" has a good response to cimetidine treatment, and behaves much like duodenal ulcer disease. ",0
"Cutaneous angiolipoleiomyoma. We describe eight cases of cutaneous angiolipoleiomyoma, a rare tumor previously reported only once under the term cutaneous angiomyolipoma. Clinically, the tumors were acquired, solitary, asymptomatic nodules that were always acral in location. Patients' ages ranged from 33 to 77 years (median 52.6 years); the male/female ratio was 7:1. Signs of tuberous sclerosis or renal angiomyolipoma were absent in all cases. Histologically, the tumors were subcutaneous, well circumscribed, and composed of smooth muscle, vascular spaces, connective tissue, and mature fat. In some tumors the fat was the predominant component, and in others smooth muscle predominated. Elastic tissue stains revealed that some blood vessels had developed an elastic lamina whereas other blood vessels lacked it. Additional histologic features occasionally observed included vascular thrombi, glomus bodies, and focal mucin deposition. ",0
"Topical treatment of necrotic foot ulcers in diabetic patients: a comparative trial of DuoDerm and MeZinc. An open randomized controlled study was carried out of 44 diabetic patients with necrotic foot ulcers treated with adhesive zinc oxide tape (MeZinc) or with an adhesive occlusive hydrocolloid dressing (DuoDerm). Fourteen of the 21 patients treated with MeZinc had their necrotic ulcers improved by at least 50% compared to six out of 21 with the hydrocolloid dressing (P less than 0.025). Fifteen patients showed an increase in the area of necrosis during the course of the 5-week study and of these, 10 had been treated with the hydrocolloid dressing. ",0
"Sumatriptan in acute migraine: pharmacology and review of world experience. The introduction of sumatriptan, a novel abortive antimigraine agent, has generated a significant amount of preclinical and clinical interest during the past few years. At the scientific level, sumatriptan is unique in terms of its selective pharmacological properties. The effects of sumatriptan in various experimental paradigms have led to new insights into the pathophysiology of migraine. At the clinical level, sumatriptan appears to be an effective abortive anti-migraine agent with minimal side effects. Its ability to decrease, rather than exacerbate, the nausea and vomiting of migraine appears to be an important advance in the treatment of migraine. ",0
"Newer antihypertensive agents. Three recent additions to the list of antihypertensive agents have been approved for use as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs. Betaxolol hydrochloride (Kerlone) maintains its effect for 24 hours, making it a true once-a-day beta blocker. Penbutolol sulfate (Levatol) is as effective as other beta blockers and diuretics. Doxazosin mesylate (Cardura), a selective alpha 1 blocker, also allows once-a-day dosing and has produced favorable changes in lipid profiles. Two new drug delivery systems, one for verapamil hydrochloride (Verelan) and one for extended-release nifedipine (Procardia XL), allow less frequent dosing and may offer other advantages, such as greater compliance and a more tolerable side-effect profile.

"A cohort study of fat intake and risk of breast cancer. Between 1982 and 1987, 519 newly incident, histologically confirmed cases of breast cancer were identified in a cohort of 56,837 women enrolled in the Canadian National Breast Screening Study. These women had completed a dietary questionnaire before the occurrence of their breast cancer, and this has been used to estimate their intake of dietary fat and several other nutrients. There is evidence of a positive association between breast cancer and total fat intake, with a relative risk of 1.35 (95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.82) per 77 g per day, and some evidence of a dose-response relationship (P = .052).

"Treatment of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis with continuous intraventricular infusion of recombinant interleukin-2. A 42-year-old man developed leptomeningeal carcinomatosis 6 years after treatment of a malignant melanoma. He was treated with two courses of recombinant interleukin-2, administered as a continuous intraventricular infusion (6 X 10E5 U/24 h) during 5 days. During the first day of the first course he also received 5 X 10E9 lymphokine-activated killer cells intraventricularly. This gave rise to a severe elevation of intracranial pressure, with headaches and meningismus. During the second course no LAK cells were administered. This course was tolerated much better. The neurological status did not change during the treatment. Recombinant interleukin-2 levels were maintained at about 300 U/mL during both courses. ",0
"Squamous cell carcinoma antigen (TA-4) in penile carcinoma. TA-4 antigen, originally isolated from women with squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, is elevated in the sera of patients with squamous cell carcinomas of several sites, including esophagus, lungs, and head and neck. In this study, we compared the serum levels of TA-4 in normal volunteers, patients with resected penile squamous cell carcinoma, and patients with metastatic penile squamous cell carcinoma. TA-4 values were elevated in 5 of 11 patients (45%) who had metastatic disease. In 2, TA-4 was normal the first time metastasis was clinically detected but rose as the disease progressed. Moreover, in 3 patients in whom serial determinations were made, serum TA-4 values correlated well with disease progression and response to treatment. We conclude that TA-4 values are elevated in some patients with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the penis and may become a useful marker for monitoring response to therapy. ",0
"Photochemotherapy improves chronic cutaneous graft-versus-host disease. We have used oral psoralen photochemotherapy (PUVA) to treat four patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease of the skin, oral mucosa, and liver, who had responded only partially to long-term immunosuppressive therapy (prednisolone, cyclosporine, azathioprine). PUVA therapy was delivered to the entire skin but not to the oral mucosa, and immunosuppressive therapy was continued in all patients. Two patients' skin lesions improved considerably; the oral lesions healed and did not recur in one. Immunosuppressive therapy could be reduced in these two patients. One patient with sicca signs did not improve. One patient had to interrupt PUVA therapy because of side effects attributed to 8-methoxypsoralen (nausea and vomiting). No flare of acute cutaneous graft-versus-host disease was noted during PUVA therapy. Chronic graft-versus-host disease of the liver did not improve in any patient. ",0
"Clinical diagnosis of Binswanger's disease. To aid in the prospective study of Binswanger's disease, a poorly understood form of vascular dementia, a standardised criteria for its antemortem diagnosis was proposed. These criteria include dementia, bilateral radiological abnormalities on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and at least two of the following three clinical findings: A) a vascular risk factor or evidence of systemic vascular disease; B) evidence of focal cerebrovascular disease; and C) evidence of ""subcortical"" cerebral dysfunction. These criteria were validated in two ways. First, by retrospectively applying them to a series of 30 demented patients with various pathological diagnoses. Second, by prospectively applying them to a series of 184 patients with clinically typical Alzheimer's disease. The sensitivity and specificity of the criteria appear adequate for use in clinical research. ",0
"Recurrent pigmented melanocytic nevus. A benign lesion, not to be mistaken for malignant melanoma. Melanocytic nevi that recur after incomplete removal are pigmented lesions that may clinically and pathologically simulate malignant melanoma in situ. Five examples of recurrent pigmented melanocytic nevus, with emphasis on light microscopic and immunohistochemical findings, are reported herein. Prominent HMB-45 staining in these nevi may cause further confusion in differentiating them from malignant melanoma. The differential diagnosis of recurrent pigmented melanocytic nevi is discussed, with particular emphasis on distinguishing these lesions from malignant melanoma. Our immunohistochemical observations indicate that the recurrences most likely develop as a result of proliferation of melanocytes remaining in the epidermis and/or adnexae following incomplete removal. The approach and management of recurrent nevi are also discussed. ",0
"Work and power in gait of stroke patients. Biomechanical analysis of the work and power patterns involved in gait provides insight into the nature of gait deficits and suggests methods for improvement. The purpose of this study was to describe the work and power characteristics during gait for both limbs of hemiplegic patients, and to determine the work and power variables related to self-selected speeds of walking. The gait of 30 ambulatory adults between the ages of 47 and 79 years was studied using two-dimensional cinematography and force-plate data in a link-segment model. About 40% of the positive work required for walking was performed by the muscles of the affected side. Major contributors were the ankle plantar flexors, hip flexors, and hip extensors. The results suggest interdependence between the limbs and between muscle groups of the same limb; a need for further research is indicated. ",0
"Simplified hepatic resection with the use of prolonged vascular inflow occlusion. Ten consecutive patients scheduled to undergo liver resection were studied prospectively with the use of a standard protocol, which included routine vascular inflow occlusion to reduce blood loss and blood transfusion requirements. Fibrin sealant was sprayed on the raw liver surface, and abdominal drainage was not performed. No deaths occurred, and the postoperative course was remarkably smooth. The normothermic liver ischemic times of 30 to 122 minutes (mean, 73 minutes) were well tolerated. The amount of blood transfused was reduced to a mean of 2 U (range, 0 to 4 U). The occurrence of infected intraabdominal bile collections in two patients with preexisting biliary tract infection suggested that abdominal drainage should be performed in such patients. Vascular inflow occlusion is recommended for all liver resections. ",0
"Cystic adenoma of the pigmented ciliary epithelium. Clinical, pathologic, and immunohistopathologic findings. A 51-year-old white man was found to have a deeply pigmented mass in the ciliary body and peripheral choroid of his right eye with an associated vitreous hemorrhage. Although the tumor appeared to be a ciliochoroidal melanoma, a melanocytoma and adenoma of the pigment epithelium also were considered in the differential diagnosis. The tumor was removed by a large partial lamellar sclerocyclochoroidectomy. Results of histopathologic evaluation showed a cystic adenoma of the pigmented ciliary epithelium. To the authors' knowledge, this was the first immunohistopathologic study of this tumor. Results of the study showed marked immunoreactivity for low molecular weight cytokeratins, vimentin, and S-100 protein. These immunohistochemical studies are consistent with the origin of this tumor from pigment epithelial cells. ",0
Role of small calibre chest tube drainage for iatrogenic pneumothorax. A 2 mm Teflon catheter was used as a chest tube in 28 patients with iatrogenic pneumothorax. Frequent aspirations through the catheter were performed in 16 of the patients. In the remaining 12 patients the catheter was connected to a one way flutter valve. The treatment was successful in 27 of the 28 patients--one patient required a large calibre chest tube. The mean drainage time was 48 hours. The small catheter technique is superior to the use of a large intercostal drain as it is much less traumatic and troublesome. The small calibre chest tube with a one way valve is recommended as a safe and easy technique. ,0
"Inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms. In a series of 517 operations for abdominal aortic aneurysm from 1971 to 1988 there were 45 cases (8.7%) with an inflammatory aneurysm with a typical thick glistening whitish fibrous layer. Almost two-third of the patients had rather severe chronic or acute progressive pain in the abdomen, the back or the flank. Unilateral (7) or bilateral (2) hydronephrosis due to ureteral compression occurred in 9 patients (20%). A diagnosis of inflammatory aneurysm was made preoperatively only in 10 patients. In 8 of the 9 patients with hydronephrosis ureterolysis was done, unilaterally (6) or bilaterally (2). After ureterolysis all had complete resolution of the hydronephrosis. Preoperative diagnostic methods are excretory urography, showing medial deviation, ultrasonography and CT-scanning of the abdominal aorta. All patients with an inflammatory aneurysm should undergo aortic replacement to prevent rupture and achieve pain relief. Ureterolysis in cases of hydronephrosis is strongly recommended and may be performed safely and with excellent results. ",0
"Antibodies in anti-HBe-positive patient sera bind to an HBe protein expressed on the cell surface of human hepatoma cells: implications for virus clearance. The relevance of the recently described membrane-bound form of the HBe protein for the antiviral immune response was examined. The data show that antibodies in anti-HBe, but not in anti-HBc-positive human sera efficiently bind to the membrane expressed HBe. No evidence was obtained that the HBc can reach the cell surface in a form that can be detected with human antibodies. The findings suggest that the decline of virus titer that is usually observed after seroconversion from HBe to anti-HBe might be the result of an antibody-mediated elimination of infected cells. ",0
"Ultrasonography in patients with suspected acute appendicitis: a prospective study. The diagnostic accuracy of high-resolution real-time ultrasonography was prospectively studied in 240 patients admitted to the hospital with suspected acute appendicitis. The criteria for ultrasound diagnosis of appendicitis included a sausage-shaped, aperistaltic, hypoechoic structure when imaged along its longitudinal axis, with a target-like appearance on transverse section. The ultrasonographic findings were correlated with surgical-pathological outcome in 82 cases with proven appendicitis, with laparotomy findings in another 21 patients and with clinical follow-up in the remainder. The overall sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis were 78%, 92% and 87%, respectively. The positive predictive value was 84% and the negative predictive value was 88%. Ultrasonography may significantly improve the diagnostic accuracy in patients with suspected acute appendicitis and should be performed in all patients in whom the clinical diagnosis is equivocal. The ultrasonographic findings must be interpreted in light of the clinical findings. ",0
"Immune response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to HBx-antigen of hepatitis B virus. The hepatitis B virus genome encodes a transcriptional transactivator protein designated HBxAg. We have investigated whether this antigen is a target structure for human T-lymphocytes. Using recombinant HBxAg protein, we found HBxAg-specific stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with acute hepatitis B virus infection (6 of 6) and chronic hepatitis B virus infection (6 of 17) but not in healthy individuals. With HBxAg-specific synthetic polypeptides, several T-cell epitopes were identified. Most were located in the carboxyterminal half of the HBxAg protein. Five T-cell clones specific for a T-cell epitope located at the carboxyterminal region of HBxAg were established and found to belong to the CD2/CD4-positive, CD8-negative subtype. These data establish for the first time HBxAg as an antigen in the cellular immune response. ",0
"The cutaneous manifestations in children with familial Mediterranean fever (recurrent hereditary polyserositis). A six-year study. In a six-year study of 46 children with familial Mediterranean fever (recurrent hereditary polyserositis), 20 children (43 per cent) developed cutaneous manifestations. Ten children had 18 episodes of erysipelas-like erythema which proved to be specific for the disease. Twelve children (26 per cent) had 31 episodes of non-specific purpuric rash and six children (13 per cent) had nine episodes of Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Other manifestations included diffuse erythema of the face, and/or trunk, angioneurotic oedema, diffuse erythema of the palms and soles followed by mild desquamation of the skin, Raynaud's phenomenon and a subcutaneous nodule. The mean frequency of the cutaneous lesions was 1.6/patient/year before colchicine therapy and 0.4/patient/year after colchicine therapy (p = 0.0005). The high incidence of cutaneous manifestations and their response to colchicine strongly suggest that skin involvement is an integral part familial Mediterranean fever. ",0
"Intravenous fluid load and recovery. A double-blind comparison in gynaecological patients who had day-case laparoscopy. The effect of intra-operative fluid and dextrose administration upon recovery was tested in a randomised, double-blind trial. Three groups of 25 patients, each undergoing laparoscopic examination as day cases, were studied. The two groups who received fluid (20 ml/kg compound sodium lactate solution) showed significant improvement (p less than 0.05) in the variables that reflected hydration. The fluid group who also received dextrose (1 g/kg) exhibited further significant improvement. Intra-operative fluid and dextrose administration appears to confer some benefit upon recovery in patients who have minor surgery. ",0
"Interaction of sodium sensitivity and stress in young adults. The interaction of sodium sensitivity and stress-induced cardiovascular reactivity was studied in white and black young adults aged 18-23 years. The cardiovascular response to difficult mental arithmetic was measured before and after 14 days of oral sodium loading (10 g NaCl/day added to the usual diet). A sodium-sensitive blood pressure response occurred in 18.4% of whites and 37.3% of blacks. A significant correlation between blood pressure change and sodium excretion occurred in the sodium-sensitive group (r = - 0.28, p less than 0.01). High sodium intake did not augment blood pressure or heart rate response to the beta-adrenergic-mediated stimulus of mental arithmetic in the population, which was grouped by blood pressure, race, or sodium sensitivity.

"Monosomy 22 in rhabdoid or atypical tumors of the brain. Cytogenetic studies of three rare childhood brain tumors were performed. Two children presented with pure rhabdoid tumors. The third child had a tumor composed of a mixture of rhabdoid elements with neuroepithelial, epithelial, and mesenchymal tissue - an atypical teratoid tumor. All three tumors demonstrated monosomy 22 as the only cytogenetic abnormality. The cytogenetic findings suggest that loss of a gene or genes on chromosome 22 may be involved in the initiation or progression of these malignant tumors. Further studies on additional fresh tumor specimens are warranted; however, it is possible that cytogenetic studies may be used as an additional means of diagnosing rhabdoid or atypical teratoid tumors of the brain.

"Total bladder replacement using detubularized sigmoid colon: technique and results. We performed total bladder replacement with a detubularized segment of sigmoid colon in patients after cystoprostatectomy. The surgical technique and long-term results in 27 patients are reported. This neobladder configuration compared favorably with other neobladder types regarding ease of construction. The surgical complications were acceptable. Initial reservoir function was good but improved further with time. After 1 year the capacity averaged 600 cc, pressures during filling and at capacity were low (average 12 and 16 cm. water) and emptying was satisfactory (residual urine 4 to 80 cc). All patients were continent during the day and 67% were continent at night without excessive voiding habits. Nighttime incontinence was further resolved in 2 patients by using the AMS 800 artificial sphincter around the bulbous urethra. The detubularized sigmoid is an excellent neobladder configuration after cystoprostatectomy. ",0
"Platysma myocutaneous flap for repair of hypopharyngeal strictures. Hypopharyngeal strictures, either isolated or in conjunction with laryngeal and esophageal strictures, can occur following lye ingestion. Extensive stricture formation requires reconstruction to create a functional funnel system that empties below the cricoid. Esophageal replacement is not a substitute for adequate hypopharyngeal reconstruction. The pectoralis major muscle is often inadequate, because it yields too much bulk and often leads to continued aspiration. The platysma myocutaneous flap for hypopharyngeal reconstruction has not been previously reported. The inferiorly based platysma myocutaneous flap was used in two of our patients with lye burns, and bilateral superiorly based flaps were used in one. All are able to eat normally and have no significant stenosis. The platysma myocutaneous flap is a relatively simple and reliable alternative that is within the capability of every head and neck surgeon. ",0
"Radiographic techniques and efficacy in evaluating esophageal dysphagia. The radiographic examination of the esophagus to determine structural and/or functional causes of dysphagia is best performed with multiple techniques. These include full-column studies to produce distended films with or without the use of a solid bolus, mucosal relief films to identify mucosal defects such as esophagitis or the presence of varices, double-contrast films, and motion recording (fluoroscopy). The efficacy of each technique depends on the quality of the study and the specific disorder to be detected. Esophageal lesions producing dysphagia are classified into extrinsic structural lesions, intrinsic structural lesions, and esophageal motility disorders. Radiographic studies are the preferred screening techniques for patients with dysphagia. Although not as sensitive for the evaluation of mucosal lesions, radiographic studies are superior to endoscopy for the detection of abnormal motility, esophageal rings, and strictures. ",0
"Complications associated with limb salvage for extremity sarcomas and their management. A retrospective clinical review of 100 consecutive patients with extremity sarcomas managed by limb salvage operations was performed to evaluate local tumor control and morbidity. The mean follow-up period was 45.1 months. Overall survival was 86%. There were local recurrences in 3% of patients, and 26 complications in 22 patients. Wound necrosis was the most frequent complication. Failure of allogeneic bone graft operations occurred in 25 patients. Most of the complications were salvageable without loss of limb. Limb salvage is an acceptable surgical treatment of extremity sarcomas based on adequate local control and minimal morbidity. ",0
"Effect of motilin on gastric emptying in patients with diabetic gastroparesis. OBJECTIVES: Because disturbances of gastric emptying are a serious complication in insulin-dependent diabetic subjects with regard to the maintenance of good metabolic control, we wanted to assess the effectiveness of motilin as a potential treatment for gastric emptying disturbances. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The intestinal hormone motilin has been shown to accelerate gastric emptying in healthy subjects. Therefore, we examined the effect of intravenous motilin on gastric emptying of a 99mTc colloid-labeled semisolid test meal in 9 insulin-dependent diabetic patients with diabetic gastroparesis. All patients had a significantly delayed gastric emptying rate compared with a group of 11 healthy control subjects. RESULTS: During the infusion of motilin, gastric emptying was accelerated, and it was no longer significantly different from control values. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that motilin and related compounds such as erythromycin derivatives could be useful for the treatment of disturbed gastric emptying in diabetic subjects. ",0
"Malignant potential of juvenile polyposis coli. Report of a case and review of the literature. Juvenile polyps of the colon and rectum traditionally have been viewed as being benign inflammatory or harmartomatous lesions without potential for malignant change. The authors report a case of adenocarcinoma developing in a patient with sporadic juvenile polyposis. Juvenile polyposis was diagnosed in the patient at age 4 years. He underwent subtotal colectomy at age 6 years. At age 12, he underwent a proctectomy and a Swenson pull-through because of adenomatous changes in the rectal stump. At age 19 surveillance endoscopy revealed invasive cancer in a juvenile polyp. ",0
"Immune-competent cells of regional lymph nodes in colorectal cancer patients: II. Immunohistochemical analysis of Leu-7+ cells. Distribution of Leu-7+ cells in cancer tissues and regional lymph nodes was immunohistochemically examined to estimate the role of NK cells in colorectal cancer patients. Leu-7+ cells were rarely observed both in the primary and distant metastatic lesions, but the number of these cells was large in the germinal center of the lymph nodes. Studies of Leu-7+ cell population in the lymph node indicated that intermediate nodes in n0 and n1 groups showed significantly higher values than those in the control group. Comparative study of the population in identical patients revealed a significantly higher rate in the intermediate nodes than in the paracolic nodes both in n0 and n1 groups. These data suggest that Leu-7+ cells might be related to the defense mechanism of regional lymph nodes against tumor. ",0
"Disruption of the human SCL locus by ""illegitimate"" V-(D)-J recombinase activity. A fusion complementary DNA in the T cell line HSB-2 elucidates a provocative mechanism for the disruption of the putative hematopoietic transcription factor SCL. The fusion cDNA results from an interstitial deletion between a previously unknown locus, SIL (SCL interrupting locus), and the 5' untranslated region of SCL. Similar to 1;14 translocations, this deletion disrupts the SCL 5' regulatory region. This event is probably mediated by V-(D)-J recombinase activity, although neither locus is an immunoglobulin or a T cell receptor. Two other T cell lines, CEM and RPMI 8402, have essentially identical deletions. Thus, in lymphocytes, growth-affecting genes other than immune receptors risk rearrangements. ",0
Orchiectomy versus oestrogen in the treatment of advanced prostatic cancer. The primary clinical efficacy of orchiectomy and the combination therapy of intramuscular polyoestradiol phosphate 80 mg monthly and oral ethinyl oestradiol 0.15 mg daily was evaluated by progression and cancer mortality rates in a series of 277 prostatic cancer patients representing part of the Finnprostate study. After a follow-up of 5 years there was a significant difference between the groups in terms of progression rate and prostatic cancer deaths. The oestrogen combination was more effective in delaying progression of the disease. The overall mortality rate was similar in both groups. About one-third of the patients were alive after 5 years. ,0
"Blood flow direction in the lumbar nerve root. The effect of clipping on lumbar nerve root blood flow rates in the region of the nerve root canal was studied experimentally in the hog. Blood flow rate was measured using the hydrogen washout technique. When the entrance zone was clipped with a microvascular clip, blood flow rate of the nerve root was decreased by 37% in comparison with the initial control rate; clipping at the exit zone reduced blood flow rate by 69%. Blood flow direction in the lumbar nerve root within the nerve root canal was found to be predominantly proximal. The current data indicate that the more lateral the impingement of the nerve root occurs, the more ischemic changes are induced. ",0
"Murine mast cells synthesize basement membrane components. A potential role in early fibrosis. Mast cells are resident in tissues, particularly in association with endothelial and epithelial cell basement membranes, and increase at sites of inflammation, injury, and fibrosis. Although mast cells are known to both release and generate proinflammatory molecules in response to inflammatory stimuli, little is known about their normal biologic function. Here we demonstrate that IL-3-dependent mouse PT18 mast cells, mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells, and rat basophilic leukemia cells express large amounts of mRNA for collagen IV, laminin, and heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Western blot analysis confirmed that mast cells synthesize and secrete significant amounts collagen IV and laminin B1 and B2 chains. These data suggest that mast cells may contribute to normal tissue repair and/or the early overproduction of basement membrane components seen in a variety of fibrotic conditions. ",0
"The role of fistulography in fistula-in-ano. Report of five cases. A retrospective review of 27 patients undergoing anal fistulography is presented. The etiology of the 27 fistulas studied are as follows: cryptoglandular infection in 18, IBD in 7 (Crohn's 6, CUC 1), iatrogenic in 1, and foreign body perforation in 1. Twenty-six fistulograms revealed either direct communication with the anus or rectum, or abscess cavities/tracts, or both. Two fistulograms revealed no radiographic evidence of fistula (one patient had two fistulograms). In 13 of the 27 patients (48 percent) information obtained from the fistulograms revealed either unexpected pathology (n = 7) or directly altered surgical management (n = 6). We conclude that anal fistulography in properly selected patients may add useful information for the definitive management of fistula-in-ano. ",0
"The axilla: not a no-go zone Many surgeons, particularly in the UK, give inadequate primary treatment to patients with operable breast cancer. For spurious reasons they regard axillary clearance as unnecessarily extensive surgery and rely instead upon total mastectomy or tumour excision and node sampling, with or without postoperative radiotherapy. But it is now clear that relapse-free and overall survival can be improved by appropriate adjuvant therapy. Thus inadequate exploration of the axilla is doubly unjustified. Not only is there the obvious risk of failure to remove nodes that contain metastases--so that some patients are deprived of cure by primary treatment--but the extent of tumour spread will be inadequately assessed in many more patients, with the risk that they may not receive appropriate adjuvant treatment.

"Primary intratemporal tumours of the facial nerve: diagnosis and treatment. Benign primary tumours of the facial nerve are uncommon. A slowly progressive facial palsy should be considered the result of a nerve tumour until proven otherwise. Improvements in diagnostic imaging techniques of the temporal bone have increased the possibility of a correct pre-operative diagnosis but facial nerve tumours remain a frequently ignored or misdiagnosed entity as a consequence of their subtle and protean clinical manifestations. A series of 12 cases of primary facial nerve tumours is presented. The clinical features, diagnostic modalities and treatment are discussed in relation to a review of the literature. ",0
"Adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma in Brazil and its relation to HTLV-I In a series of fourteen patients with adult T-cell lymphoma-leukaemia (ATLL) in Brazil the main features were lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, hypercalcaemia, and high leucocyte counts, with abnormal lymphoid cells which had irregular nuclei. The series included the youngest patient with ATLL so far (18 months). Analysis with monoclonal antibodies showed a mature T-cell phenotype (CD4+, CD8-). Antibodies to HTLV-I and/or integration of HTLV-I proviral DNA were found in eleven patients. In the other three HTLV-I DNA could not be demonstrated even by means of the polymerase chain reaction; they therefore had HTLV-I-negative ATLL. This report of ATLL in Brazil corroborates serological reports that HTLV-I may be endemic in some parts of that country. Follow-up studies are required to identify precisely the main route of transmission of HTLV-I in South America and the risk factors for the development of ATLL in carriers. ",0
"Second cancer after radiation therapy for cancer of the uterine cervix. Radiation-induced cancers after radiation therapy for cancer of the uterine cervix were investigated on 11,855 patients including 5725 patients treated with radiation therapy alone, 1969 postoperative radiation therapy and 4161 surgery alone. The observed-to-expected ratios of the second primary cancer was 0.933 for the patients with radiation therapy alone and 1.074 for the patients with postoperative radiation therapy, respectively. No significant increase was observed in the risk of second primary cancers when all sites were combined. However, assessing on site by site basis, significant excess was noted for the rectum cancer, leukemia, and bladder cancer for the radiation therapy group but not for the surgery group. A significant excess of lung cancer was observed in both radiation therapy and surgery groups, which was attributed to some other causative factors. Radiation-induced cancers were suggested to develop apparently in organs involved in the irradiated field. ",0
"Triggers of transient myocardial ischemia: circadian variation and relation to plaque rupture and coronary thrombosis in stable coronary artery disease. The phenomenon of transient myocardial ischemia is common in patients with stable coronary disease and appears to be due both to increases in myocardial demand and to episodic coronary vasoconstriction. The circadian variation of transient ischemic episodes closely parallels the circadian variation of acute coronary syndromes associated with plaque rupture, such as myocardial infarction and sudden death. These concordant temporal patterns of transient ischemia, myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death probably represent independent manifestations stemming from the consequences of increased sympathetic activity.

"Rib infarcts and acute chest syndrome in sickle cell diseases. In the absence of evidence for pneumonia or pulmonary embolus, primary pulmonary infarction has been assumed to be the cause of the syndrome of chest pain, fever, and pulmonary infiltrate on chest X-ray that commonly complicates sickle cell anaemia. To find out whether the syndrome might be due to rib infarction, 99mTc-diphosphonate bone scans were done. In the eleven episodes thus investigated (10 patients) the scans showed segmental areas of increased radionuclide uptake in ribs, indicative of bone infarction. A possible sequence of events is that the rib infarcts are primary and cause bone pain, followed by soft tissue reaction, pleuritis, and splinting. The resultant hypoventilation leads to atelectasis and subsequent development of the radiographic changes of the acute chest syndrome. Prevention of hypoventilation and treatment of bone pain are important therapeutic goals. ",0
"Risk factors for transmission of hepatitis B virus to Gambian children [published erratum appears in Lancet 1990 Dec 22-29;336(8730):1596] Risk factors for hepatitis B virus transmission were examined in 973 Gambian children aged 6 months to 5 years. 33% had evidence of infection with hepatitis B virus and a third of these were carriers. A significant association was found between infection and tropical ulcer scars, and between e antigenaemia and the presence of bedbugs in each child's bed. There was no association between infection and traditional scarring, circumcision, or injections. Skin disease and arthropods are the two most likely modes of transmission of hepatitis B virus between children in West Africa. ",0
"Cerebral infarction: early detection by means of contrast-enhanced cerebral arteries at MR imaging. The authors describe a new magnetic resonance (MR) imaging sign of acute cerebral ischemia/infarction. Abnormally contrast material-enhanced curvilinear structures were demonstrated in eight patients in the evolving area of cerebral ischemia/infarction within 26 hours after the ictus on contrast-enhanced, high-field-strength (1.5-T), T1-weighted spin-echo images. The abnormal enhancement is considered to represent cortical arterial vessels of markedly slowed circulation in areas of underlying brain injury, which will eventually progress to frank brain infarction. This was demonstrated at computed tomographic (CT) and follow-up MR examinations. Characteristically, the degree of the contrast enhancement of vessels appeared most intense in the proximal portions, and the intensity of enhancement gradually diminished in the more distal portions of these vessels as they pass over the convexities and finally disappear.

"Modified anterior compartment resection. In the majority of patients with soft tissue sarcomas of the anterior compartment of the thigh, it is possible to preserve a small portion of the quadriceps with intact nerve supply without compromising on the radicality of the procedure or the local control rate. The distal one-third of the vastus medialis can usually be spared with a long, slender branch providing its innervation. Dissection of the femoral nerve below the inguinal ligament and its branch(es) to an uninvolved area of the quadricepts the farthest from the location of the tumor is essential. This modified anterior compartment resection improves dramatically the function of the extremity. ",0
"Early gastric cancer. Endoscopic diagnosis of depth of invasion. In order to decide on a treatment strategy against gastric cancers, an accurate preoperative evaluation of the depth of cancer invasion is essential. Preoperative endoscopic diagnosis of the depth of invasion was compared with pathological results of the resected specimen in 206 early gastric cancers and 32 early-like advanced gastric cancers. The endoscopic distinction between early and early-like advanced cancers was correctly made in 83.6% of the cases. Among the early gastric cancers, mucosal and submucosal invasion was correctly presumed in 71.9% of the cases. When the tumor was an elevated type, or located in the antrum, the endoscopic diagnosis tended to be deeper than the true depth. The size of tumor contributed little to the depth diagnosis. Pathomorphological changes on the tips of converging folds were the important clue for diagnosing depth. ",0
"Peritoneal dialysis in the geriatric patient. Elderly patients on chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD) from two large chronic peritoneal dialysis programs were compared with younger patients in regard to peritonitis rates, catheter problems, hospital days, transfers to other forms of therapy, and mortality. Peritonitis rates and organisms were similar in younger and older patients. Catheter replacements were less common in the elderly. Differences in hospital days were attributable to hospitalization for vascular disease. The elderly were more likely to have the first episode of peritonitis, to die and to change dialysis modalities at all times after the first year of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) treatment, although other than increased mortality, differences between the two groups were small. CPD appears to be an acceptable form of renal replacement therapy in the elderly. ",0
Study of preneoplastic changes of liver cells by immunohistochemical and molecular hybridization techniques. The status of hepatitis B virus DNA was investigated by in situ hybridization in multifocal areas of a noncancerous hepatitis B virus-associated cirrhosis. This liver exhibited a marked degree of dysplasia and adenomatous hyperplasia. The results of these studies were correlated with the histopathology and immunohistochemical stains for hepatitis B core and surface antigens. There was clear evidence of a marked reduction to absence of hepatitis B viral DNA by in situ hybridization and absence of HBc and HBsAg in the foci of liver cell dysplasia and adenomatous hyperplasia. These results support the hypothesis that liver cell dysplasia and adenomatous hyperplasia are preneoplastic in nature. ,0
"Environmental risk factors in siblings with Parkinson's disease. To investigate possible risk factors in Parkinson's disease, we conducted a case-controlled study of 19 families having two or more siblings with Parkinson's disease. Demographic data were collected, including lifetime histories of places of residence; sources of drinking water; occupations, such as farming; and exposure to herbicides and pesticides. Rural living and drinking well water, but not farming and herbicide exposure, were significantly increased in 38 parkinsonians compared with 38 normal control subjects. A comparison of parkinsonian siblings with siblings with essential tremor revealed no differences in any risk factors for the years of shared environment. These data suggest that living in a rural environment and drinking well water are risk factors for Parkinson's disease and that the total life exposure to an environmental toxin may be more important than exposure in early life.

"Common headaches: type, duration, frequency and implications. Questionnaires completed by 327 preclinical medical and dental students showed that 97.9% had experienced headaches, most frequently attributed to insufficient sleep (38.8%), mental stress (38.8%), alcohol (38.5%), excess heat (36.7%), reading (31.5%), excess noise (29.9%) or light (27.7%), and sleeping too long (23.5%). The frequency and duration of these and other headaches are listed. 8% of the headache group had consulted a doctor. Only 2.1% of all students had never experienced a headache. Two hypotheses are examined: (1) can headaches be normal?--delineated by their disappearing soon after the noxious stimulus has ceased; (2) can pain in the head, as elsewhere in the body, act as a warning and therefore have protective, even survival value?.

"Diffuse hemangiomatosis of the spleen: splenic hemangiomatosis presenting with giant splenomegaly, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. In an elderly patient with oligosymptomatic giant splenomegaly, clinical and laboratory data were nondiagnostic, while nonhomogeneous splenic enlargement was the only finding detected by imaging procedures. Splenectomy was performed and diffuse hemangiomatosis of predominantly capillary-type found. The failure of imaging techniques to even hint at the nature of the underlying disorder is comprehensible in view of the organ being essentially replaced in toto by the abnormal vascular channels. Diffuse splenic hemangiomatosis, a rare condition, may cause hypersplenism, and its diagnosis may be elusive because of misleading patterns on imaging. ",0
"Scleroderma and L-tryptophan: a possible explanation of the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. Scleroderma developed in six women who were taking L-tryptophan. Fasciitis and morphea were most common, but one patient had pleural effusion, hypertension, and signs of cardiac and kidney failure. In five patients the biopsy findings were characteristic of scleroderma; the sixth patient had Crohn's disease and developed fasciitis; her biopsy specimen showed inflammatory arteritis. All patients' conditions improved after cessation of their L-tryptophan intake, initiation of corticosteroid therapy, or both. These findings confirm previous data that show altered tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism in some patients with scleroderma and fasciitis, particularly with tryptophan loading. ",0
"Prognostic factors and value of adjunctive nephrectomy in patients with stage IV renal cell carcinoma. We reviewed 57 cases of Stage IV renal cell carcinoma to clarify the factors influencing prognosis and to evaluate the value of nephrectomy. Cumulative survival from the initial diagnosis was analyzed with respect to the patients' age, sex, side of primary tumor, initial performance status (PS), site of metastasis, and nephrectomy. Overall survival for the patients was 51 percent at one year, 22 percent at three years, and 11 percent at five years. Age, sex, and side of primary tumor had no influence on survival. Improved survival was correlated with good PS, metastases limited to single organ, and removal of the primary tumor. With regard to histopathologic features in nephrectomized patients, low grade and stage were correlated with longer survival. These factors should be considered in the analysis of results of future clinical trials of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. ",0
"Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery. Surgical alternatives depending of the age of the patient. Four cases of anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery, three of which were operated upon in our Centre, are presented. An aortocoronary bypass with reversed autologous saphenous vein was carried out in both of the children; and in the adult, the anomalous ostium was closed from the interior of the pulmonary artery. After 84, 72, and 4 months of evolution, respectively, they were found to be asymptomatic, the mitral insufficiency had disappeared and the venous graft remained patent. In this paper, the clinical form of presentation, diagnostic possibilities and surgical treatment are analysed. ",0
"Hyperfunctioning metastatic follicular thyroid carcinoma in Pendred's syndrome. A 66-year-old woman with Pendred's syndrome underwent a partial thyroidectomy when she was 17 years old. At the age of 52 years, she had a second thyroid operation because of hyperthyroidism due to a toxic multinodular goiter with a mediastinal extension consisting of several separate nodules. Five years later a hyperfunctioning metastatic follicular carcinoma was diagnosed histologically. After treatment with radioactive iodine, the patient was well. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first description of a metastatic follicular thyroid carcinoma in Pendred's syndrome and the first report of hyperthyroidism occurring after malignant degeneration of a dyshormonogenetic goiter.

"Estrogen receptors in the external anal sphincter. Inasmuch as anal competence in women is reduced after the age of 50 years, it may be dependent on effects of estrogens. In this study, samples of the external anal sphincter were analyzed for the presence of estrogen receptors and were found to be present at a median concentration of 5.0 fmol per milligram of protein (range, 1.9 to 13) in women (n = 7), and 1.1 fmol per milligram of protein (range, 0 to 3.2) in men (n = 7). These findings are of interest with regard to the treatment of idiopathic anal incontinence. ",0
"Middle cerebral artery strokes causing homonymous hemianopia: positron emission tomography. Eight patients were evaluated with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography between 3 and 30 days after isolated stroke involving the middle cerebral artery territory that caused homonymous hemianopia. Diffuse hypometabolism was present throughout the damaged cerebral hemisphere, even in cortical areas not obviously ischemic by clinical examination or neuro-imaging. Glucose metabolism in primary and association visual cortex of the damaged hemisphere was decreased by more than 47% (p less than 0.01). Metabolism in the undamaged hemisphere was less profoundly affected, but significant decrements were found in calcarine (40%; p less than 0.01) and lateral occipital cortex (35%; p less than 0.05).

"Splicing defect at the ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) locus in gyrate atrophy. Gyrate atrophy (GA), a recessive eye disease involving progressive vision loss due to chorioretinal degeneration, is associated with the deficiency of the mitochondrial enzyme ornithine aminotransferase (OAT), with consequent hyperornithinemia. We and others have reported a number of missense mutations at the OAT locus which result in GA. Here we report a GA patient of Danish/Swedish ancestry in whom one OAT allele produces an mRNA that is missing a single 96-bp exon relative to the normal mRNA. Polymerase-chain-reaction amplification and sequencing revealed a 9-bp deletion covering the splice acceptor region of exon 5, resulting in the absence of exon 5 sequences from the mRNA with no disruption to the reading frame. This mutation, which was not present in 15 other independent GA patients, adds to the array of allelic heterogeneity observed in GA and represents the first example of a splicing mutation associated with this disorder.

"Quantifying language development from birth to 3 years using the Early Language Milestone Scale. A point-scoring technique for the Early Language Milestone Scale is described. Normative data based on the original 1982 cross-sectional sample and validation data based on a separate longitudinal sample are presented. Mean Early Language Milestone Scale point scores, standard deviations, and percentile equivalents for raw point scores are presented for all ages from birth to 36 months. Correlations between point scores on the Early Language Milestone Scale and scores on other standardized developmental tests such as the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, and the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities are presented. The clinical and research advantages of this point-scoring technique are presented and compared with the original pass/fail scoring method. ",0
"Association between urinary symptoms at 7 years old and previous urinary tract infection. The association between current micturition habits and previous urinary tract infection was analysed among 3553 school entrants aged 7 years by means of a questionnaire. A high incidence of urinary infection, confirmed by urine culture, was found (145 (8.4%) in the 1719 girls and 32 (1.7%) in the 1834 boys). There was a significant association between current symptoms that were suggestive of disturbed bladder function and previous urinary tract infection, but only among girls who were over 3 years of age at the time the first episode was diagnosed.

"Current status of duplex Doppler ultrasound in the examination of the abdominal vasculature. Duplex Doppler ultrasound has come to play a central role in the diagnosis of a broad spectrum of vascular diseases such as carotid artery occlusive disease and deep vein thrombosis. The role of duplex Doppler in the evaluation of intra-abdominal vascular disease remains unclear. This article summarizes the current status of duplex scanning in the investigation of the mesenteric arteries, the renal arteries, and the portal venous system. The examination is technically demanding, operator-dependent, time-consuming, and frequently unsatisfactory due to bowel gas, obesity, complex anatomy, or postoperative alterations in the normal anatomic patterns. Its advantages reside primarily in the absence of toxicity and in the generation of physiologic as well as anatomic information. In centers with the proper instrumentation and a skilled technician, duplex examination can be useful in the diagnosis and management of abdominal vascular disease and avoids the inherent dangers of contrast angiography.

"Premalignant lesions: role of antioxidant vitamins and beta-carotene in risk reduction and prevention of malignant transformation. Epidemiological studies have shown that diets rich in one or more antioxidant nutrients may reduce the risk of cancers of the lung, uterine cervix, mouth, and gastrointestinal tract. Study of premalignant lesions offers a comparatively expedient approach to identifying and evaluating the efficacy of the cancer chemopreventive components of foods. Some recent findings suggest roles for beta-carotene and/or vitamin C in reversing or reducing the risk of cervical dysplasia and oral leukoplakia. There are some indications that vitamin C and beta-carotene may reduce the risk of atrophic gastritis and gastric cancer. Additional epidemiological and molecular biology studies and clinical intervention trials using premalignant lesions as the marker of specific cancer risks should become an important component of future research in the area of cancer chemoprevention.

"Percutaneous pedestal in cochlear implantation. Direct electrical connection between an external sound-processing device and intracochlear electrodes is accomplished via a percutaneous pedestal. Patient pedestal complaints and experience have been recorded. Pedestal problems have been classified into six classes, with class 0 indicating no problems and the severity of problem increasing in classes 1 through 4. Class 5 indicates pedestal trauma. No class 5 problems were encountered. At 48 months of experience, 53% of patients were class 0 and 26% were class 1. The pedestal experience is detailed in the paper. The percutaneous pedestal has been found to be a well-tolerated, efficient system for information transfer in cochlear implant patients. ",0
"Experimental alcoholic skeletal muscle myopathy is characterised by a rapid and sustained decrease in muscle RNA content. An investigation was made into the effects of ethanol feeding (36% of total calories) on skeletal muscle. From 7 to 42 days, muscle weights and protein and DNA contents of alcohol-treated rats were significantly lower (10-23%) than pair-fed controls (with glucose as 36% of total calories). Ethanol feeding markedly reduced muscle RNA content by 22-34%, when compared to controls. Muscle RNA content of ethanol-fed rats at 7, 14, 28 and 42 days of treatment was significantly lower than initial values (i.e. at 3 days) by 22-38%. Thus, ethanol feeding caused an initial net loss and thereafter a reduction in the rate of accretion of RNA. The marked and sustained loss in the muscle protein synthetic apparatus may be a precipitating event in the development of experimental skeletal muscle myopathy. ",0
"Nausea, vomiting, and retching. Although nausea, vomiting, and retching have plagued mankind since antiquity, limited attention has been given to the three symptoms as separate entities. Although knowledge of symptom occurrence is essential to practice, nurses must focus on patients' response or distress to the occurrence of symptoms. The differentiation of symptom occurrence and symptom distress of nausea, vomiting, and retching is critical to the management and self-care demands of patients and the enhancement of their quality of life. Basic research on patterns of these individual symptoms and their components promises to provide a more progressive and fruitful approach to the patient response to these symptoms. ",0
"Repair of coarctation with persistent fifth arterial arch and atresia of the fourth aortic arch. Coarctation of the aorta with persistent fifth arterial arch and atresia of the fourth aortic arch between the left common carotid and left subclavian arteries was treated surgically in a two-month-old boy with transposition of the great arteries and double-outlet right ventricle. The aortic arch was repaired using side-to-side anastomosis of the left common carotid and left subclavian arteries, patch repair of the coarctated segment at the origin of the left subclavian artery, and ligation of the patent ductus arteriosus. Pulmonary arterial banding and balloon atrioseptostomy were performed for associated anomalies. ",0
"Immunohistochemical demonstration of keratin in ameloblastoma as an indication of tumor differentiation. Keratin expression was studied immunohistochemically in 27 ameloblastomas using polyclonal antibody against wide-spectrum keratins (TTL) and monoclonal antibodies against lower- and higher-molecular-weight keratins (PKK1 and KL1), respectively, to clarify the tumor differentiation. Reactions with TTL and KL1 antibodies were generally positive in the stellate cells of the follicular or acanthomatous ameloblastomas. Cell nests of the basal cell type were positive for PKK1. On the other hand, the reactions with TTL or KL1 in the plexiform type were generally weak or absent. From these facts, it was concluded that the follicular, as well as acanthomatous, ameloblastoma is liable to undergo squamous differentiation, whereas the plexiform ameloblastoma remains in primitive stage of tumor differentiation.

"Risk of myocardial infarction and death during treatment with low dose aspirin and intravenous heparin in men with unstable coronary artery disease. The RISC Group 796 men with unstable coronary artery disease (unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction [MI] ), were randomised to double-blind placebo-controlled treatment with oral aspirin 75 mg/day and/or 5 days of intermittent intravenous heparin. The risk of MI and death was reduced by aspirin. After 5 days the risk ratio was 0.43 (confidence intervals, 0.21-0.91), at 1 month 0.31 (0.18-0.53), and at 3 months 0.36 (0.23-0.57). Aspirin reduced event rate in non-Q-wave MI and unstable angina, independently of electrocardiographic abnormalities or concurrent drug therapy. Heparin had no significant influence on event rate, although the group treated with aspirin and heparin had the lowest number of events during the initial 5 days. Treatment had few side-effects and high patient compliance. ",0
"Embolization with particles in thoracic intramedullary arteriovenous malformations: long-term angiographic and clinical results. To evaluate the long-term results of endovascular treatment with particles in the management of thoracic intramedullary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), the authors retrospectively reviewed the angiographic and clinical findings in 35 patients. Follow-up was 1-15 years (mean, 6 years) in 28 patients and 6-10 months (mean, 7 months) in seven. A total of 158 embolization procedures were performed in 35 patients. Revascularization occurred frequently, necessitating multiple endovascular sessions. Long-term clinical evaluation showed clinical improvement, compared with the initial status before treatment, in 63% of the patients. Clinical aggravation due to embolization was observed in seven patients (20%) after 12 of the 158 endovascular sessions (8%). These results are better than those reported after surgery and indicate that embolization with particles is an efficient and safe tool in the treatment of thoracic intramedullary AVMs. ",0
"Mucogenic secondary open-angle glaucoma in diffuse epithelial ingrowth treated by block-excision. We treated a 40-year-old man with an acute, unilateral, open-angle glaucoma caused by a gelatinous translucent material in the anterior chamber. A clinical diagnosis of mucogenic secondary open-angle glaucoma caused by diffuse epithelial ingrowth after ocular trauma one year earlier was suspected, but a primary or secondary ciliary body or iris neoplasm could not be ruled out. A curative 9-mm block-excision was performed. Six years later, intraocular pressure was normal, and the visual function was unchanged. Light and electron microscopy disclosed an island of diffuse columnar epithelium with numerous goblet cells on the iris surface and copious mucinous material extending into the trabecular mesh-work.

"Persistent uptake of indium-111-antimyosin monoclonal antibody in patients with myocardial infarction. Indium-111(111In)-antimyosin scintigraphy was investigated in 27 patients with myocardial infarction. 111In-antimyosin Fab was administered intravenously, and planar and single photon emission computed tomographic images were obtained 48 hours later. Uptake of 111In-antimyosin was present in 9 of 10 patients (90%) studied within 6 days of infarction. During the second week positive scans were seen in 16 of 16 patients (100%) including 13 (81%) who had normal creatine kinase levels. The mechanism of persistent positive antimyosin images in the subacute stage of myocardial infarction remains to be clarified. 111In-antimyosin scintigraphy may be useful as a noninvasive method for the detection of myocardial injury late and early after a suspected acute myocardial infarction.

"Functional outcomes following selective posterior rhizotomy in children with cerebral palsy. The recent increase in popularity of selective posterior rhizotomy demands objective documentation of surgical outcome. For this reason, the authors have analyzed the status of 25 children with spastic cerebral palsy before and after rhizotomy to determine the effects of this therapy on muscle tone, range of movement, and motor function. Postoperative tests showed a reduction in muscle tone compared with preoperative assessments. Range of motion in the lower extremities was significantly increased and improvements in functional gross motor skills were noted. An increase in range of motion in the knees and thighs during gait was detected in 18 ambulatory patients studied with computerized two-dimensional motion analysis. Preliminary findings indicate that selective posterior rhizotomy reduced spasticity, thereby increasing range of motion and contributing to improvements in active functional mobility. ",0
"Historical review of pancreaticoduodenectomy. The performance of pancreaticoduodenectomy by Whipple in 1935 demonstrated that the operation was feasible technically and compatible with reasonable function after recovery. From the mid- to late 1940s until the last 10 years, the procedure was condemned by many because of its associated mortality and morbidity. For reasons that are not clear, the risk of pancreaticoduodenectomy in the last 10 years has fallen to less than 10% and in several centers, less than 5%. Postoperative complications have been reduced and blood transfusions are unnecessary in an increasing number of patients. Furthermore, a normal productive life without the need for medication and with no digestive disorder is expected. Seventy-one percent of patients are able to return to their preoperative occupation.

"Chronic Lyme disease with an expansive granulomatous lesion in the cerebellopontine angle. Expansive granulomatous lesions in the posterior cranial fossa are rare and have not been reported in conjunction with Lyme disease. We report a patient with verified Borrelia burgdorferi infection who developed a tumor in the cerebellopontine angle. Rapid growth of the tumor led to signs of cerebral compression and to hydrocephalus. Surgical intervention was required despite florid meningitis. The histological examination showed inflammatory, nonspecific granulation tissue. The origin of this tissue is almost certainly causally related to the B. burgdorferi infection. Signs of inflammation resolved rapidly after subtotal resection. The clinical, radiological, and biochemical course is documented. This is the first report of an expansive cerebral lesion in the chronic phase of Lyme disease. ",0
"Magnetic resonance imaging in idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis: measurement of T1 relaxation time. Magnetic resonance imaging at 0.08 Tesla was performed in nine patients with proven idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis. A total of 11 scans was performed. Three patients were scanned before diagnosis; one of these also had two follow-up scans. A further six patients were scanned a variable time after diagnosis and treatment. On each scan, a periaortic soft-tissue mass was readily identified, the distribution corresponding to that seen on computed tomography. There was no difference in the mean T1 relaxation time of the mass between patients scanned before diagnosis and those scanned after treatment. However, the patient followed with serial scans showed a progressive reduction in the T1 value of the mass with time. Comparison with results obtained in patients with lymphoma suggests that the T1 values in retroperitoneal fibrosis are lower than in lymphoma, particularly non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. ",0
Transcranial electrical motor evoked potentials as a prognostic indicator for motor recovery in stroke patients. Transcranial electrical motor evoked potentials (MEP) were examined in 33 patients within three days after stroke. Normal values for MEP and motor central conduction time (CCT) were obtained in 46 healthy controls whose MEPs were evaluated during slight voluntary muscle contraction and at rest. Two months later 23 patients were re-examined clinically and electrophysiologically. Motor function change was correlated with MEP results. Two months after stroke the patients with normal or prolonged CCT had an improved motor function compared with those with absent CCT. MEP may be a valuable prognostic indicator in the acute stage of paralytic stroke for recovery of motor function. ,0
"Postinduction repression of the beta-interferon gene is mediated through two positive regulatory domains. Virus induction of the human beta-interferon (beta-IFN) gene results in an increase in the rate of beta-IFN mRNA synthesis, followed by a rapid postinduction decrease. In this paper, we show that two beta-IFN promoter elements, positive regulatory domains I and II (PRDI and PRDII), which are required for virus induction of the beta-IFN gene are also required for the postinduction turnoff. Although protein synthesis is not necessary for activation, it is necessary for repression of these promoter elements. Examination of nuclear extracts from cells infected with virus reveals the presence of virus-inducible, cycloheximide-sensitive, DNA-binding activities that interact specifically with PRDI or PRDII. We propose that the postinduction repression of beta-IFN gene transcription involves virus-inducible repressors that either bind directly to the positive regulatory elements of the beta-IFN promoter or inactivate the positive regulatory factors bound to PRDI and PRDII.

"Continent ileocolonic urinary reservoirs for filling and lining the post-exenteration pelvis. Pelvic exenteration has a high complication rate due, in large part, to the extensive raw surfaces and dead space it creates. Numerous techniques have been used to control this space and line these surfaces, but none, to date, has proven to be a reliable solution. We investigated the use of continent ileocolonic urinary reservoirs as a new ""flap"" to fill and line the pelvis in 17 patients, and found that our historical complication rate of 44% for pelvic exenteration was reduced to 18%. These reservoirs appear to be an improved method of managing the post-exenteration pelvis. ",0
"Exercise capability in heart failure: is cardiac output important after all? The exercise capability of 39 patients with severe chronic heart failure was assessed in several ways and compared with measurements of cardiac output. The relation between cardiac index and exercise tolerance measured on a treadmill was poor (r = 0.191, p = 0.245). However, exercise tolerance measured with a series of self-paced corridor walk tests showed moderate correlations with cardiac index (r = -0.404, p = 0.015 to r = -0.516, p = 0.001) and customary activity assessed by step counting correlated better with cardiac index (r = 0.537, p less than 0.001). Cardiac output therefore seems to be a factor determining patients' exercise capability when they choose their own walking speed but not when they undergo formal treadmill tests in the laboratory.

"Routes and incidence of communication of lumbar discs with surrounding neural structures. Several authors have previously reported the complications resulting from contact between a diagnostic or therapeutic agent injected into an intervertebral disc and neural tissue. This study was undertaken to demonstrate the common routes by which, and frequency with which this contact occurs. Of 105 cadaveric intervertebral discs studies, 15 (14%) leaked. Of the discs that leaked, 27% demonstrated contact of injected dye with the adjacent spinal nerve. The high rate of leakage may be related to the age of the cadavers. Nonetheless, the contact between substances injected into an intervertebral disc and adjacent neural tissue during discography offers an alternate mechanism of pain reproduction in an incompetent disc. It also suggests that nontoxic agents should be used for discography and that intervertebral discs should be proved competent before chemonucleolysis. ",0
"Rapid control of refractory atrial tachyarrhythmias with high-dose oral amiodarone. To shorten the delay in the onset of antiarrhythmic effect when using amiodarone for the conversion of refractory atrial tachyarrhythmias to sinus rhythm, 19 patients were given oral amiodarone according to a high-dose loading protocol. In 18 of 19 patients (95%), sinus rhythm was restored 36 hours (range, 0 to 96 hours) after starting amiodarone. The conversion occurred as a result of amiodarone therapy alone within 48 hours in 12 patients (63%), and by amiodarone therapy plus electrical cardioversion at 48 to 96 hours in six patients (32%). Minor side effects were noted in eight patients (42%). No major side effects were encountered. The length of hospital stay after initiating amiodarone therapy was 3.6 days (range, 2 to 5 days). High-dose oral amiodarone loading is a safe and effective method for the rapid conversion of atrial tachyarrhythmias to sinus rhythm. ",0
"Malignant glandular triton tumor. A case of left brachial plexus-related malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor showing neoplastic, glandular, and rhabdomyoblastic elements in a 39-year-old Chinese man is reported. The authors suggested that this tumor be termed a malignant glandular triton tumor in view of the presence of the adenocarcinomatous component. The patient had extensive local recurrence comprising mainly the Schwann spindle cells within a year after complete piecemeal removal and died 15 months later after the initial presentation. The natural behavior of this tumor, as in other reported cases of malignant triton tumor, is extremely aggressive, unlike malignant schwannoma or glandular malignant schwannoma. The histogenesis of this tumor is likely to be from primitive neural crest cells, Schwann's cell precursors, or metaplastic malignant Schwann's cells. ",0
"Reversed lateralization of cognitive functions in right handers. Exceptions to classical aphasiology. Most current and past research on the cerebral organization of cognitive functions has presupposed certain specialized hemisphere operations. At least for right handers, language and praxis are to be organized in the left hemisphere, while affective prosody, configurational spatial capacity, and global attention are lateralized in the right hemisphere. Deviations from these presuppositions, as in crossed aphasics and perhaps left handers, are generally considered to be 'exceptions' and either to disprove the rules or to be irrelevant to the rule. We report 4 very 'exceptional' cases, right handers with almost entirely reversed lateralization of functions. Analysis of the intrahemispheric relationships between functions suggests that there may be a specific neurobiology to the interrelationships between and among cognitive functions, handedness, and the intrahemisphere localization of the function.

"Ichthyosis, mental retardation, and asymptomatic spasticity. A new neurocutaneous syndrome with normal fatty alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase activity. A number of inherited disorders of cornification have been related to abnormal lipid metabolism. In the recessively inherited Sjogren-Larsson syndrome, defined by the triad of ichthyosis, mental retardation, and spasticity, fatty alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase deficiency has recently been reported. These patients accumulate fatty alcohol in the plasma and cultured fibroblasts. A 19-year-old woman with ichthyosis, mental retardation, and mild spasticity is described in whom fatty alcohol metabolism was normal, as determined by plasma octadecanol level and fibroblast fatty alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase activity. Ultrastructural studies on skin from the patient revealed morphologically abnormal epidermal lamellar bodies, not unlike those seen in neutral lipid storage disease with ichthyosis. We postulate that this patient has a novel neurocutaneous syndrome that may be secondary to abnormal lipid metabolism. ",0
"Early gastric cancer. Twenty-eight-year experience. A retrospective study of early gastric cancer (60 patients) was performed to evaluate its diagnosis and treatment. Ninety-five per cent of patients presented with nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms and 53.3% had been treated for presumed benign disease for up to 48 months before diagnosis. Fiberoptic endoscopy detected these lesions more accurately than radiologic examination. The disease-free 5-year survival rate after resection was 76.4%. Survival showed no significant correlation with sex, tumor site, macroscopic appearance, extent of gastric resection, or histopathologic type. Tumors larger than 1.5 cm in diameter, invasion of submucosa, or lymph node metastasis resulted in significantly lower survival rates. Three of eight patients with nodal metastasis survived 5 or more years, including one who had second-echelon deposits. A high index of suspicion may permit more frequent detection. Extended lymphadenectomy (R2) is recommended to achieve the highest possible cure rate. ",0
"Surgical treatment of active native valve endocarditis. A report is presented of 24 patients (23 male), mean age 38 years, who underwent surgery for active native valve endocarditis of the left heart in 1975-1988. The aortic valve was affected in all patients, and also the mitral valve in five. Pre-existing aortic valve disorder was present in 17 cases (13 congenitally bicuspid 4 rheumatic affection). There were five hospital deaths (20.8%). Staphylococci as causal organism and extensive infection predicted the highest mortality and morbidity. The mean follow-up time was 39.7 (range 2-114) months. Two reoperations because of prosthetic valve dehiscence revealed endocarditis of the implanted valve. Strong correlation was found between favourable postoperative course and rapid normalization of C-reactive protein levels, which did not fall in patients with persistent infection. Early surgery is recommended if the course of bacterial endocarditis is severely complicated. ",0
"Response to suxamethonium in a myasthenic patient during remission. A cumulative dose followed by an infusion was used to determine the dose response to suxamethonium in a patient with diagnosed myasthenia gravis who was in true remission (asymptomatic while receiving no therapy). The ED50 and ED90 values for suxamethonium were 0.08 mg/kg and 0.20 mg/kg, and an infusion rate of 3.2 mg/kg/hour was required to maintain a 90-95% depression of the single twitch response as monitored by integrated electromyography. These values are within the range for normal patients, and we conclude that myasthenic patients during a true remission may not demonstrate resistance to suxamethonium. ",0
"Interpleural analgesia [published erratum appears in Heart Lung 1991 Jul;20(4):413] Postoperative pain relief is necessary not only for patient comfort, but also to facilitate ventilation and ambulation. The use of opioid analgesia, either intravenously, intramuscularly, or intraspinally, may be ineffective and can cause respiratory depression. The administration of local anesthetics into the pleural space is a technique of providing analgesia of rapid onset and long duration. This analgesia is accomplished without causing the respiratory depression or sedation associated with the use of opioids. Because innovative analgesic methods are often selected for critically ill patients presenting after surgery in the intensive care setting, critical care nurses may encounter patients receiving local anesthetics administered via interpleural catheter.

"Mobile knee reconstructions after resection of malignant tumors of the distal femur. Limb-salvage surgery involving mobile knee reconstructions for malignant tumors about the distal femur is a desirable and achievable goal. With limb salvage, the survival rate does not decrease significantly, and the resulting function is superior to when an amputation plus a prosthesis are used. Immediate and delayed morbidity is greater after limb-salvage surgery than after amputation. However, with thorough preoperative planning, use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy as indicated, and an experienced team of surgeons, limb-salvage surgery can provide a mobile knee with excellent function in the vast majority of cases for patients with malignant tumors of the distal femur.

"Serial CA 125 levels during chemotherapy for metastatic or recurrent endometrial cancer. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of serial CA 125 in monitoring disease status during chemotherapy in women with metastatic or recurrent endometrial cancer. CA 125 was measured in 21 women receiving cisplatin, etoposide, and Adriamycin for a total of 275 courses of chemotherapy (median eight). Eight of ten patients had elevated pre-therapy CA 125 levels (median 233 U/mL). CA 125 became and/or remained negative in all 20 women with responding or stable disease and was elevated in all nine patients who relapsed. The median level at the time of relapse was 56 U/mL. Levels were elevated before clinical relapse in five of nine patients (56%). Serial CA 125 may aid in the management of women receiving chemotherapy for advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. ",0
Role of systemic therapy in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. Increasing evidence supports the investigation of chemotherapy in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Randomized studies in patients with stage IV disease have shown increased survival in chemotherapy-treated patients compared to best supportive care and indicate the ability of chemotherapy to alter the natural history of this disease. Randomized studies involving adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy have also shown encouraging results. These studies and results of recent pilot studies utilizing neoadjuvant chemotherapy and concomitant chemoradiotherapy indicate a potential benefit from the use of chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC and call for its continued intensive investigation in clinical trials. ,0
"An inner city cancer prevention clinic. Design, methods, and early results. An American Cancer Society demonstration pilot project is underway that is designed to provide comprehensive cancer prevention-related services to the underserved community of West Oakland, California. An array of cancer prevention services are being made available through an inner-city clinic (West Oakland Health Center), including cancer risk assessments and education about cancer, physical examinations for cancer, teaching of self-examination procedures, smoking cessation, and nutrition counseling, appointments for Pap smears, sigmoidoscopy, mammography, and other more specialized screening procedures, case management for findings suspicious for cancer, and community education programs. Described is the process of implementing these services, their utilization, and their impact (after 6 months). ",0
"Unusual blink reflex with four components in a patient with periodic ataxia. Characteristic findings in blink reflex are reported in a 55-year-old female with periodic ataxia. The blink reflexes on the side ipsilateral to the stimulation consisted of four components with latencies of 11, 21, 35 and 47 ms, instead of the usual two components seen in normal subjects. On the contralateral side, the last three components were also present. The second component was different from the normal R2 response in that its latency was shorter than normal and it did not habituate by stimulation at a rate of 10 Hz. In addition, it was more affected by diazepam than the third or fourth components. It is considered that R2 may have consisted of three components and that a shorter latency of the second component could be explained by facilitation. ",0
"Ischaemic heart disease among men in Norway during the period 1966-1985: two counties with different mortality time trends. We have examined regional differences in mortality from ischaemic heart disease, including sudden, unexpected death (IHD/SUD), among Norwegian men aged 30-69 years, during the period 1966-1985. Mortality time trends were considered. The two counties with the most widely differing IHD/SUD mortality time trends were Rogaland and Oppland. Rogaland, located in south-western Norway, experienced a 24.1% IHD/SUD mortality rate decrease between 1966-1970 and 1981-1985, while Oppland, in central south-eastern Norway, experienced a mortality rate increase of 12.4%. Marked regional differences within these counties were found. The highest IHD/SUD mortality rate increase occurred in rural areas of Oppland. Urban areas of Rogaland had sharply decreasing rates. Knowledge of such regional mortality differences could provide useful information regarding aetiological factors and serve as a basis for preventive measures and health-care planning. ",0
"pH-adjustment and discomfort caused by the intradermal injection of lignocaine [published erratum appears in Anaesthesia 1991 Mar;46(3):242] One hundred adult day-case patients who required intravenous access had cannulae inserted using local anaesthesia with 1% lignocaine, 1% lignocaine with adrenaline or the corresponding pH-adjusted solutions. The local anaesthetic solutions were modified by the addition of 1 ml 8.4% sodium bicarbonate to 10 ml lignocaine. Pain scores at different stages of cannulation were noted and showed a significant reduction after use of pH-adjusted solutions (p less than 0.02 for the plain lignocaine, and less than 0.001 for the lignocaine with adrenaline). Modification of the pH of lignocaine solutions by the addition of sodium bicarbonate is a simple method significantly to reduce the discomfort caused by the infiltration of the local anaesthetic. ",0
"Histochemical demonstration of 5'-nucleotidase activity in inflammatory muscle disease. Using a histochemical method, 5'-nucleotidase activity was investigated in 80 muscle biopsy specimens, including specimens from eight patients with muscular dystrophy, 18 with nonspecific type II fiber atrophy, 15 with polymyositis, and 29 histologically normal controls. An interstitial reaction for 5'-nucleotidase was associated with an inflammatory infiltrate in 19 of 21 positive cases. Of the 15 cases of polymyositis, 14 showed an extensive interstitial reaction surrounding most of the myofibers and extending well away from the areas infiltrated by inflammatory cells. The extensive nature of this reaction makes 5'-nucleotidase activity a useful adjuvant in the diagnosis of inflammatory muscle disease. ",0
"An epidemic outbreak of cryptosporidiosis: a prospective community study from Guinea Bissau. In the first year of a prospective community study of childhood diarrhea conducted in a semiurban area in the capital of Guinea Bissau, Cryptosporidium sp. was found in 73 (6.0%) of 1216 episodes of diarrhea. The parasite was the second most prevalent intestinal parasite, and the only one significantly associated with diarrhea (OR = 2.79, P = 0.0006). The seasonal distribution was striking, with a peak prevalence in the beginning of the rainy season (May 17.6%) when an epidemic outbreak of diarrhea started. The prevalence was highest in children younger than 18 months, an age at which prevalences of other intestinal parasites were low. This reverse age pattern may possibly be explained by the small infective dose needed to create severe infections, by air-borne transmission and by the development of protective immunity. ",0
"Prediction of cognitive change as a function of preoperative ability status among temporal lobectomy patients seen at 6-month follow-up. The relationship between preoperative ability levels and postoperative changes in cognitive function was examined among 23 left (LTL) and 19 right (RTL) temporal lobectomy patients using a battery of memory, language, and visuospatial tasks administered approximately 3 months before surgery and at 6 months follow-up. Higher preoperative performances on the memory and language measures were associated with larger decrements in postsurgical scores among the LTL patients. The RTL group showed no consistent relationship between preoperative ability levels and subsequent postsurgical cognitive changes. Based on the present data, we constructed base-rate tables for the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised indicating the likelihood of measurable gains or losses in memory as a function of presurgical ability level for patients undergoing LTL. While tentative, these data provide a useful and practical guide for counseling prospective epilepsy patients of the attendant cognitive risks of LTL. ",0
"Antiepileptic drugs, cognitive function, and behavior in children: evidence from recent studies. The effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) on cognitive function and behavior in children are reviewed on the basis of published studies. Individual AEDs have been shown to differ--the deleterious effects of phenytoin generally contrasting with the relatively minimal effects of valproate and carbamazepine. Some of the differences between results may be attributed to the psychological tests used and to age differences. However, there appears to be a dissociation between AEDs that affect higher cognitive function, e.g., phenytoin, and those mainly affecting motor function, e.g., carbamazepine, which appears to increase speed of performance, AEDs should be prescribed with care in children with epilepsy, taking account of their differing effects on cognitive function and behavior.

"Spontaneous perinephric hemorrhage: imaging and management. We report on 10 patients with spontaneous perinephric hemorrhage associated with underlying disease, including renal cell carcinoma (5), angiomyolipoma (2), malignant melanoma (1), periarteritis nodosa (1) and severe portal hypertension (1). The etiology could not be identified with computerized tomography (CT) in 5 cases (50%), including 2 renal cell carcinomas, 1 angiomyolipoma, 1 periarteritis nodosa and 1 portal hypertension. Arteriography demonstrated underlying lesions in 4 of these 5 cases (80%) including the case of vasculitis. CT combined with magnetic resonance imaging is accurate for the diagnosis of spontaneous perinephric hemorrhage but the underlying pathological condition is often undetectable in the acute phase due to the perinephric blood. CT should be the first study performed if this diagnosis is suspected. Arteriography is recommended if a renal mass is not detected. If a mass is not identified with these 2 imaging studies and the patient is clinically stable, followup thin slice CT should be performed. ",0
"New horizons in the treatment of coronary artery thrombosis. The application of recombinant DNA methodology to clinical medicine offers the clinician a new generation of more potent and specific therapies. Recombinant methods offer great promise in the treatment of coronary artery thrombosis. This review focuses on the characterization of 1) molecules that activate plasminogen locally (in the vicinity of a thrombus) rather than systemically, and 2) molecules that offer new approaches to the inhibition of platelet activation and thrombin activity. We first describe the methods used to uncover these molecules and their characterization at the molecular level. The ways in which this knowledge can lead to the development of agents tailored to clinical needs are then explored. ",0
"Threshold perimetry in tilted disc syndrome. Twelve consecutive patients (17 eyes) with tilted disc syndrome underwent quantified visual field examination with the G1 Octopus program (Interzeag AG, Schlieren, Switzerland). Visual fields were abnormal in all cases. Although field loss was more pronounced in the superotemporal quadrant (P less than .001), it also involved the other three quadrants, thus demonstrating that optic nerve hypoplasia in tilted disc syndrome is apparently not entirely sectorial. Linear regression analysis showed that an increase in mean defect correlated with increase in myopic refractive error (P less than .05). However, the increase in myopic refractive error was found to be related to a decrease in corrected loss variance (P less than .05), indicating that in tilted discs with higher myopia, field loss is more homogeneous. With this series of patients, short-term fluctuation was within normal ranges in all visual fields, showing that this may be an additional clue for differential diagnosis from acquired disorders. ",0
"Long-term medical consequences of incest, rape, and molestation. One hundred thirty-one patients who gave a history of childhood sexual abuse were seen in a general medical practice decades after the event and were compared with a control group. The subject patients were found to be distinct for chronic depression, morbid obesity, marital instability, high utilization of medical care, and certain psychosomatic symptoms, particularly chronic gastrointestinal distress and recurrent headaches. It is clear that these remote events can underlie difficult chronic medical problems. Questions about childhood sexual abuse must become part of the practitioner's review of systems in these difficult cases, if not routinely. ",0
"The electrocardiogram in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The electrocardiogram is often abnormal in patients who have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The most frequent abnormalities are a rightward P-wave axis (greater than or equal to 70 degrees) and a rightward QRS axis (greater than or equal to 90 degrees). In addition, low voltage in the limb leads, an S1S2S3 pattern, poor R-wave progression, a posterior-superior terminal QRS vector or other changes may be present. Transient atrial and ventricular dysrhythmias are common. Knowledge of the usual electrocardiographic manifestations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease enables the clinician to recognize uncharacteristic abnormalities, which often represent the effects of superimposed illnesses or drug toxicity.

"Isolated trigeminal sensory loss secondary to a distal anterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysm: case report. A previously healthy 25-year-old woman suddenly developed right-sided facial numbness and a headache. The neurological examination was within normal limits with the exception of meningismus and right-sided facial sensory loss. A computed tomographic scan and a magnetic resonance imaging study demonstrated an acute hematoma in the right cerebellopontine angle. A 4-vessel cerebral angiogram revealed no abnormalities. Posterior fossa exploration disclosed a large, partially thrombosed, fusiform anterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysm, which indented the pons at the trigeminal root entry zone. The aneurysm was excised, and the patient made an excellent recovery. She was left with a persistent trigeminal sensory deficit. Anterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysms are rare lesions that generally present with a cerebellopontine angle syndrome; occasionally, facial sensory loss is also a feature. Isolated trigeminal sensory findings, as illustrated in this case, are extremely unusual in posterior fossa vascular lesions. ",0
"Umbilical cord hematoma following diagnostic funipuncture. Major complications associated with funipuncture have been reported but are rare. This is a report of a diagnostic funipuncture performed on a 29-week fetus with a single umbilical artery and multiple malformations. Immediately after the procedure, a voluminous hematoma developed at the site of needle insertion in association with a severe fetal bradycardia. Fetal death was confirmed within 5 minutes of needle insertion. It is hypothesized that the risk of complications of funipuncture may vary according to the clinical indication for the procedure and may be increased in the presence of certain fetal malformations. The rapid evolution of complications, as occurred in the present case, underlines the importance of having a clear plan of management in the event of mishap and discussing this plan with the parents before undertaking diagnostic funipuncture.

"Endoscopic ventricular fenestration using a ""saline torch"". The fiberoptic endoscope has never gained popularity among neurosurgeons although it is ideally suited for navigating within the cerebral ventricles. Recent advances in optics and miniaturization make the application of endoscopy in neurosurgery more practical. The authors report eight children who underwent ventriculoscopic fenestration of symptomatic loculated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collections. These CSF collections were either isolated ventricular cysts or trapped lateral ventricles secondary to obstruction at the foramen of Monro. Cyst wall dissection was carried out with a ""saline torch"" dissector which was introduced through a working channel in the ventriculoscope. The torch was used to coagulate vessels and to sculpt large windows in cyst walls or in the septum pellucidum. Ventriculoscope-guided cyst fenestration can be performed safely and easily under direct vision. The technique may permit simplification of shunt systems in some patients and elimination of shunts in others. ",0
"Neurinoma in the cavernous sinus: report of two cases. Two cases of trigeminal neurinoma located solely in the cavernous sinus are reported. Preoperatively, magnetic resonance imaging provided the accurate localization of the lesions, allowing precise planning of the surgical approach, that is, a subtemporal lateral approach and a pterional superior approach, respectively. The neurinomas inside the cavernous sinus were removed successfully, and the patients developed no new neurological deficits except for anesthesia in the 1st division of the trigeminal nerve. The characteristic magnetic resonance imaging findings of trigeminal neurinoma in the cavernous sinus are presented, and the different surgical approaches are discussed. ",0
"Intraosseous lipoma within the femoral head. A case report. Intraosseous lipoma occurring within the femoral head seems not to have been previously reported. Symptoms associated with the tumor included slowly increasing pain and a cystic lesion shown on roentgenograms. Management was by total hip arthroplasty. Pathologic examination of the specimen showed that the tumor was composed almost entirely of mature adipose tissue in keeping with a diagnosis of Stage 1 intraosseous lipoma. A sclerotic border and osteoid seams were noted, two features that seem not to have been previously reported in early lesions. Recent papers suggest intraosseous lipomas are more common than previously thought, and the femur now accounts for 25% of reported cases. ",0
"Infarct of the conus medullaris simulating a spinal cord tumor: case report. A 71-year-old woman had the sudden onset of a neurogenic bladder and a stepwise increase in paraparesis that left her unable to stand or walk. Magnetic resonance imaging showed what appeared to be a tumor in the conus medullaris. After laminectomy, the lesion was localized by ultrasound examination, and a biopsy was performed. The deficits remained unchanged postoperatively. Microscopic examination of the biopsy specimen showed necrosis and pathologic changes consistent with infarction of the conus medullaris. An anomalous arterial supply of the conus medullaris is the most likely cause of this unusual problem. The patient gradually regained her ability to walk, but the neurogenic bladder persists. ",0
"Unusual aspects of aortovenous fistulas associated with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms. Three unusual cases of an abdominal aortic aneurysm spontaneously rupturing into the retroperitoneum and an adherent posterior vein are reported. No patient demonstrated signs or symptoms of an aortovenous fistula before surgery. Emergent surgery prevented extensive preoperative diagnostic testing. The three abdominal aortic aneurysms were very large and averaged 13 cm in diameter. One fistula involved an inflammatory aneurysm, which is the fifth such case reported. The aortic fistulas were to the inferior vena cava (158 other cases reported in the English-language literature), a left renal vein (16 other cases reported), and an iliac vein (7 other cases reported). Routine use of the cell-saver, oversewing of the fistula from within the aneurysm, and a heightened awareness that this unusual complication is more common in the presence of a very large, ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm should improve survival.

"Genetic diagnosis of Lynch syndrome II in an extended colorectal cancer-prone family. Knowledge of colon cancer genetics, with particular attention to precision in hereditary cancer syndrome diagnosis, can often enable highly targeted surveillance and management strategies for patients at high genetic risk. Unfortunately, the patient's family history of cancer is often given minimal attention, and knowledge of hereditary cancer syndromes is frequently limited. Indeed, many physicians still consider familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) as the only genetic risk factor for colorectal cancer. This concern with FAP was noted in a colorectal cancer-prone kindred which for decades had been thought to manifest that syndrome. However, after meticulous genetic, medical, and pathologic studies, the cardinal phenotypic characteristics of Lynch syndrome II were observed. The potential for cancer control in current and future generations of families like this one clearly mandates the need for computerized registries which could transmit current information about hereditary colon cancer syndrome diagnosis, surveillance, and management.

"Epstein-Barr virus associated oesophageal ulcers in AIDS. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) associated ulceration has not previously been included in the differential diagnosis of oesophageal ulcers in AIDS. We report five cases of oesophageal ulceration in homosexual men with advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection in whom this was considered to be the most likely cause. DNA in situ hybridisation studies showed EBV in biopsy material from three of four patients with oesophageal ulcers and in none of three controls. Of other viruses studied, only human papillomavirus was present, and this was found in both patients and control subjects. These findings support the hypothesis that EBV is an aetiological factor in some cases of AIDS-associated oesophageal ulceration. ",0
"Recurrence rate after discontinuation of long-term mebendazole therapy in alveolar echinococcosis (preliminary results). The recurrence rate was investigated in 19 patients with non-resectable alveolar echinococcosis after discontinuation of a long-term therapy with mebendazole (average treatment 4.3 years). A control group consisted of 14 patients who underwent radical surgery and finished a course of prophylactic postoperative mebendazole treatment of 2 years. In the controls, no recurrence was observed after a post-therapy period averaging 3.5 years. In contrast, recurrence occurred in 7/19 patients (37%) with non-resectable alveolar echinococcosis an average of 1.6 years after discontinuation of the long-term mebendazole therapy. The absence of clinically detectable recurrence in the remaining 12 patients seems to be due either to spontaneous inactivation of alveolar echinococcosis preceding chemotherapy or too short post-therapy surveillance. The patients with recurrence responded favorably to reintroduction of chemotherapy. The data indicate that mebendazole therapy is parasitostatic rather than parasiticidal. ",0
"Transient myocardial ischemia and its relation to determinants of myocardial oxygen demand. Because of conflicting data and a clear need to establish the relative role of increase in myocardial oxygen demand versus reduction in coronary blood flow in the causation of transient ischemia, the role of heart rate and blood pressure changes immediately preceding and during the transient ischemic events observed during daily life were evaluated in 25 patients with coronary artery disease. Elevations in heart rate before onset of ischemia were observed in 61% of the episodes. Similarly, 73% of the ischemic events were preceded by an increase in arterial pressure. These data provide evidence for a significant role of increased myocardial oxygen demand in the genesis of transient myocardial ischemia. ",0
"Surgical results of intrathoracic gastric volvulus complicating hiatal hernia. From 1981 to 1988, 138 patients with hiatal hernia were treated surgically at our centre. Twenty-one (mean age 76.6 years, 17 women, four men) had an associated intrathoracic gastric volvulus. Eleven patients (mean age 73.2 years), of whom eight were asymptomatic, had an elective procedure. Ten patients (mean age 80.3 years) had emergency surgery, six for acute complications of the volvulus (five cases of strangulation and one of perforated ulcer) and four because of other, unrelated causes of acute abdomen. There were four deaths after operation, all in the emergency surgery group. Four other patients had significant morbidity, all in the emergency group. In the elective cases, all hernias were easily reduced. In one emergency case a gastrotomy was necessary for decompression, and in another gastrectomy was necessary because of gastric gangrene. Our results indicate the need for elective intervention when intrathoracic gastric volvulus is first diagnosed. ",0
"Mesial temporal sclerosis: pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management. Mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) is probably the most common symptomatic pathologic entity--alone or mixed with other pathologic features--for seizures of temporal lobe origin. The pathophysiology of MTS, including any genetic influence, needs clarification. A characteristic ictal expression for seizures of MTS origin appears not to exist. The majority of patients (78%) with postresection MTS who are seizure-free have tightly localized interictal abnormalities restricted to F7/F8, Sp1/Sp2, T3/T4, and T5/T6 more than 96% of the time. MRI abnormalities may be seen in 55% of patients with MTS if both ""hard"" and ""soft"" criteria are used or in 20% when only ""hard"" criteria are used. The neuropsychologic evaluation of patients with MTS, which includes intracarotid amobarbital test (IAT), may prove to be increasingly useful in identifying patterns of cognitive deficit that correlate with enhancement of both lateralizing and localizing preoperative information.

"Doppler echocardiographic evaluation of streptokinase lysis of thrombosed right-sided St. Jude Medical valves in patients with congenital heart defects. Four episodes of St. Jude Medical prosthesis leaflet thrombosis were serially evaluated by two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography during treatment with streptokinase. Three patients aged 4, 11, and 24 years with congenital heart disease had St. Jude Medical valves in pulmonary positions (two cases) for tetralogy of Fallot and in the tricuspid position (one case). The duration of thrombosis was not known in any patient. Leaflet immobility and its resolution were demonstrated by echocardiography and were confirmed fluoroscopically. Continuous wave Doppler echocardiography showed abnormal stenotic gradients in thrombosed valves that were reduced after thrombolysis. These studies demonstrate the utility of two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography in serial evaluation of prosthetic pulmonary and tricuspid valve thrombosis during thrombolysis. ",0
"Indwelling epidural catheters for pain control in gynecologic cancer patients. Seven patients with severe pain caused by an advanced, incurable gynecologic malignancy were treated with an indwelling epidural catheter connected to an implantable subcutaneous port through which morphine was infused. There were few major complications associated with insertion or maintenance of the system. The average usage was 60 days, although the system functioned continuously for 6 months in one patient. Pain distribution in these women ranged from the upper abdomen to the lower extremities. All patients, including one with liver metastases, reported good to excellent pain control with the epidural narcotics. Two subjects with upper abdominal pain occasionally required supplemental oral oxycodone, but the other five patients had adequate pain relief with the epidural system alone. The indwelling epidural system provides excellent analgesia for patients with advanced, incurable gynecologic cancer. ",0
"Cumulative load as a risk factor for back pain. The association between cumulative load (biomechanic load and exposure time integral over the entire work experience) and back pain was investigated in a group of institutional aides with physically stressful jobs. A questionnaire/interview was conducted with 161 of these institutional aides. The point prevalence of back pain in this sample was 62%. Men had worked a mean duration of 14.3 years and women 11.6 years at the time of the onset of the first pain episode. Every job performed was analyzed by the use of a two-dimensional static mathematical model. The compression and shear at the thoracolumbar and lumbosacral discs were computed by the use of a biomechanic model. Cumulative compression and shear were significantly higher in institutional aides with pain compared with those without pain (P less than 0.05-0.01). The pain group was similar to the no-pain group in age, weight, and height. ",0
"Perivascular innervation of the cerebral arteries in spontaneously hypertensive rats--an immunohistochemical study. Perivascular innervation in cerebral arteries of spontaneously hypertensive rats and of normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats was studied. Adrenergic nerve fibers and neuropeptide Y-containing nerve fibers, indicative of vasoconstrictor nerves, were denser in all cerebral arteries of spontaneously hypertensive rats than those of Wistar-Kyoto rats. In contrast, cholinergic nerve fibers and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, substance P-containing nerve fibers, indicative of vasodilator nerves, remained unchanged in all cerebral arteries of spontaneously hypertensive rats, as compared with findings in the Wistar-Kyoto rats. Thus, not only adrenergic nerve fibers but also neuropeptide Y-containing nerve fibers may play an important role in preventing the disruption of the blood-brain barrier and the development of hypertensive encephalopathy in spontaneously hypertensive rats.

"Chronic Lyme disease with an expansive granulomatous lesion in the cerebellopontine angle. Expansive granulomatous lesions in the posterior cranial fossa are rare and have not been reported in conjunction with Lyme disease. We report a patient with verified Borrelia burgdorferi infection who developed a tumor in the cerebellopontine angle. Rapid growth of the tumor led to signs of cerebral compression and to hydrocephalus. Surgical intervention was required despite florid meningitis. The histological examination showed inflammatory, nonspecific granulation tissue. The origin of this tissue is almost certainly causally related to the B. burgdorferi infection. Signs of inflammation resolved rapidly after subtotal resection. The clinical, radiological, and biochemical course is documented. This is the first report of an expansive cerebral lesion in the chronic phase of Lyme disease. ",0
"The effect of chemotherapy on growth in the skeletally immature individual. One hundred twenty-two children with nonmetastatic osteogenic or Ewing's sarcoma were studied to assess the effect of multiagent adjuvant chemotherapy on skeletal growth and final stature. No deviations from the height distributions of a normal population were noted at diagnosis. There was a marked retardation of linear growth during the year of intensive chemotherapy. Only 15% of the patients grew at the expected rate during that year. The distribution of nutritional status scores was significantly different at the end of the first year than at baseline. The distribution of ultimate height scores was significantly different than the baseline distribution. The overall final distribution was also significantly different from the normal population expectation. Any absolute difference in height, however, is likely to be small. The subgroups that were observed to full adult stature showed mean heights of 162 cm for girls and 176 cm for boys. ",0
"An objective comparison of intrathecal lidocaine versus fentanyl for the treatment of lower extremity spasticity. The reduction of spasticity after administration of intrathecal fentanyl, 35 micrograms, and intrathecal lidocaine, 50 mg, was compared with preinjection spasticity levels in ten subjects with central nervous system disease or injury. Spasticity was objectively assessed by an electronic instrument that simultaneously measures degrees of extension and force during passive knee extension. Duration of spasticity relief and adverse effects were recorded. Both drugs equally reduced spasticity and increased the range of motion. There were no supraspinal side effects from the fentanyl, whereas three subjects became hypotensive after receiving lidocaine. The reduction of spasticity with intrathecal fentanyl lasted at least 3 h. The authors postulate that fentanyl reduced spasticity by an effect on spinal pathways. Intrathecal fentanyl should be considered as an alternative to lidocaine for diagnostic blocks in patients with spasticity. ",0
"Pearson's marrow-pancreas syndrome. A multisystem mitochondrial disorder in infancy. Pearson's marrow-pancreas syndrome (McKusick No. 26056) is a fatal disorder of hitherto unknown etiology involving the hematopoietic system, exocrine pancreas, liver, and kidneys. The observation of high lactate/pyruvate molar ratios in plasma and abnormal oxidative phosphorylation in lymphocytes led us to postulate that Pearson's syndrome belongs to the group of mitochondrial cytopathies. Since rearrangements of the mitochondrial genome between direct DNA repeats were consistently found in all tissues tested, our results show that this disease is in fact a multisystem mitochondrial disorder, as suggested by the clinical course of the patients. Based on these observations, we would suggest giving consideration to the hypothesis of a defect of oxidative phosphorylation in elucidating the origin of other syndromes, especially those associated with an abnormal oxidoreduction status in plasma.

"Intraoperative massive suprachoroidal hemorrhage during pars plana vitrectomy. Seven eyes (7 patients) developed massive suprachoroidal hemorrhage (MSCH) during pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) for complicated retinal detachments. The MSCH developed late in the procedure following PPV, air fluid exchange, endolaser, cryopexy, and scleral buckling in five of seven eyes. In two eyes, mild hemorrhagic choroidal detachments noted intraoperatively progressed to MSCH within 72 hours postoperatively. Diagnosis of MSCH was confirmed by echography and CT scan. Multiple scleral buckling surgeries, high myopia, aphakia, and intraocular inflammation were the main risk factors. Placement of a broad posterior scleral buckle with intraoperative hypotony and cryopexy were important precipitating factors. Visual results were poor, with six of seven eyes showing no light perception. The mean follow-up time was 12.8 months. Once acute MSCH is recognized intraoperatively, surgical decompression at that time should be avoided as MSCH itself may tamponade the choroidal bleed. Details of prevention and management are discussed. ",0
"Human cerebral malaria: association with erythrocyte rosetting and lack of anti-rosetting antibodies. Plasmodium falciparum isolates from 24 Gambian children with cerebral malaria and 57 children with mild forms of the disease were assessed for their ability to form erythrocyte rosettes. All isolates from the children with cerebral malaria were able to form rosettes, whereas those from children with mild forms of the disease did not form rosettes, or had a significantly lower rosetting rate. Plasma of children with cerebral malaria lacked anti-rosetting activity, whereas plasma of children with mild disease could often disrupt rosettes in vitro. A monoclonal antibody to P falciparum histidine rich protein (PfHRP1/KP/KAHRP) disrupted rosettes of many of the isolates in vitro indicating that the rosetting ligand is relatively conserved compared with ligands associated with endothelial cytoadherence. The findings strongly support the hypothesis that erythrocyte rosetting contributes to the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria and suggest that anti-rosetting antibodies protect against cerebral disease.

"Cor triatriatum dexter: antemortem diagnosis in an adult by cross sectional echocardiography. Cor triatriatum dexter is a rare cardiac abnormality in which the right atrium is subdivided into two distinct chambers. This anomaly is generally attributed to the persistence of the right sinus venosus valve and it is frequently associated with severe malformations of other right heart structures. The antemortem diagnosis of the membrane may be difficult and its presence is often only established at necropsy. In a woman of 56 with Ebstein's anomaly the echocardiographic features of cor triatriatum dexter were examined before and during cardiac catheterisation. These investigations showed the position of the membrane, that there was no gradient between the two atrial chambers, and that there were perforations in the centre of the membrane. ",0
"Questionable role of CNS radioprophylaxis in the therapeutic management of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma with meningeal extension. A series of 15 consecutive children with head and neck nonorbital rhabdomyosarcoma (RMSA) with meningeal extension were prospectively treated with chemotherapy consisting of Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratory, Columbus, OH) (ADM), vincristine (VCR), cyclophosphamide (CPM), and dactinomycin (DACT) followed by radiotherapy (60 Gy) to the primary tumor volume, along with intrathecal methotrexate (IT MTX). Thirteen of 15 responded to preradiation chemotherapy. Four of 13 relapsed. Relapse occurred at the level of the primary tumor in three of four. The 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 59%, similar to that achieved in a previous series treated with a comparable therapeutic approach that also included whole-brain radiotherapy as a prophylaxis of possible occult meningeal seeding. It is concluded that CNS prophylaxis with radiotherapy is questionable in the management of childhood RMSA with meningeal extension. ",0
"Natural killer cell activity in patients with liver cirrhosis relative to severity of liver damage. To evaluate the role of severe liver damage on natural killer cell activity, 29 patients with liver cirrhosis were examined. The natural killer cell activity was measured with a 4-hr chromium release assay, and the K562 cell line was employed as target cells. The natural killer cell activity was significantly decreased in cirrhotic patients compared with normal controls and patients with chronic active hepatitis. Cirrhotic patients with Pugh's C grade of severity of liver disease had lower natural killer cell activity. The depression of natural killer cell activity in cirrhotic patients was inversely correlated with prothrombin time ratios, and the natural killer cell activity in cirrhotic patients with hepatic encephalopathy was lower than in patients without hepatic encephalopathy. Thus, the diminished natural killer cell activity in cirrhotic patients might be related to the severity of liver damage. ",0
"The neuroradiology of visual disturbances. The neuroradiology of visual deficits has advanced dramatically in recent years. Plain film evaluation of the orbit and face remains useful in the emergency room for the evaluation of trauma. High-resolution coronal CT remains the method of choice in the assessment of serious injury to the orbit and in cases of penetrating metallic foreign body. The contrast-enhanced orbital CT provides useful information in cases of tumor and infection and when the bones of the face or skull are involved. MRI has largely replaced CT in the search for brain infarct, brain tumor, and cerebral inflammatory and demyelinating processes. MRI is the study of choice in all cases of sellar and parasellar disease. It offers high-resolution images in any plane. GTPA enhancement has provided additional information from MRI without significant risk. The final selection of an imaging modality should be based upon the clinical presentation and any physical limitations of the patient. ",0
"Sleep apnoea syndrome associated with maxillofacial abnormalities. Four cases with Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome (OSAS) are presented. They consisted of two cases with TMJ ankylosis with micrognathia, one case with Treacher Collins Syndrome, and one case with the Long Face Syndrome. Standard and specific cephalometric parameters were obtained to detect the site of the obstruction. Polysomnographic studies yielded information regarding the patient's sleep-wake state, respiratory and cardiac functioning, pre- and post-operatively. A temporary tracheostomy corrected the symptoms in one patient but the syndrome recurred when it was closed. Surgical correction of the maxillofacial anomalies will re-establish normal sleep patterns preventing OSAS. ",0
"Postural hypotension: pressor effect of octreotide not mediated by norepinephrine. Orthostatic hypotension of the Shy-Drager syndrome is a chronic incapacitating condition characterized by lack of an appropriate increase in the plasma norepinephrine level in response to standing. Recently, the somatostatin analogue octreotide has been reported to induce a pressor response in patients having this syndrome. We have reported a case of Shy-Drager syndrome in which octreotide was effective, but the rise in blood pressure was not accompanied by an increase in the plasma norepinephrine level. Hence, the pressor effect of octreotide is not mediated by stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system, but probably through splanchnic vasoconstriction. ",0
"Glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinemia of cirrhosis are not results of spontaneous or surgical portosystemic shunting. To assess if spontaneous portosystemic shunting from collaterals contributes to the hyperinsulinemia of cirrhosis, 12 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis underwent a 5-hour oral glucose tolerance test 1 day before and 10 days after an elective side-to-side portacaval shunt. The glucose, insulin, and C peptide responses to oral glucose post-shunt were exaggerated but comparable to preoperative values. Compared with preoperative values, the fasting molar ratio of C peptide to insulin postoperatively had increased 40% (6.0 +/- 1.2 versus 8.4 +/- 0.7), indicating improved hepatic function. These results suggest that extrahepatic portosystemic shunting secondary to spontaneous splanchnic collaterals plays little or no role in the hyperinsulinemia of cirrhosis. It appears that decreased hepatic degradation of insulin in these patients is secondary to hepatocellular dysfunction rather than a result of shunting of portal blood around the liver. ",0
"Power drills to fenestrate exposed bone to stimulate wound healing. Power drills can be used to stimulate the formation of granulation tissue over exposed cortical bone. These tools allow for the rapid fenestration and selective abrasion of large areas of exposed bone; fenestration and abrasion create the multiple bleeding points essential for the production of granulation tissue. The granulation tissue thus produced is allowed to grow out through the holes to cover bone. This procedure can be performed in an outpatient setting, usually without the need for either local or general anesthesia; it is particularly useful for patients considered to be poor risks for general anesthesia. Healing by granulation tissue is a somewhat slow process, but it has a high success rate, causes few complications, and produces very good cosmetic results. Two cases illustrate the method of fenestration of exposed cranial bone to stimulate granulation tissue. Specific instructions describe the needed care of exposed bone. ",0
"Surgical resection of intrinsic brain stem lesions: an overview. A major limitation to the effective treatment of intrinsic mass lesions of the brain stem has been the inability to clearly define the pathological anatomy radiographically. The improved soft tissue resolution offered by magnetic resonance imaging, as compared with axial computed tomography, now makes it possible not only to accurately distinguish anatomical relationships, but also to predict the pathological nature of the lesion. Accordingly, we have been encouraged to pursue a more aggressive approach to intrinsic lesions of the brain stem that appear well circumscribed on magnetic resonance imaging scan. The object of this paper is to report the successful treatment of four intrinsic lesions of the brain stem and to present an overview of the relevant published experience. ",0
"Experimental oral foreign body reactions: vegetable materials. Foreign bodies and tissue reactions to foreign materials are commonly encountered in the oral cavity. Exogenous materials most commonly causing foreign body reactions are metallic in origin (usually amalgam). Of the nonmetallic materials seen during biopsies, suture materials and vegetable matter are most often observed. Since many foodstuff foreign materials are unidentifiable histologically, common vegetables were experimentally implanted subcutaneously in rats to assess local host responses and to characterize the nature of these materials microscopically. The histologic characteristics of these vegetable foreign body reactions are detailed herein. The implanted materials correspond to reactions seen in human subjects. ",0
"Massive splenomegaly. Superior results with a combined endovascular and operative approach. Splenectomy for massive splenomegaly (drained splenic weight, greater than 1000 g) has an uncommonly high morbidity and mortality because of technical challenges and problems of hemostasis. In a group of 10 patients with massive splenomegaly due to myeloproliferative disorders (average splenic weight, 4193 g), we developed a management algorithm based on preoperative angiographic embolization of the splenic artery. Average operating time was 1.7 hours (range, 1 to 2.5 hours). Average blood loss was 528 mL; six of the 10 patients had blood loss less than 250 mL. There were four minor complications and one major complication (gastric ulcer requiring reoperation). There were no deaths in the perioperative period, and no patients required reoperation for hemorrhage. ",0
"Vitrectomy retinotomy aspiration biopsy of choroidal tumors We used an investigational technique for the biopsy of intraocular tumors to aid in the diagnosis of three choroidal tumors. A three-port trans-pars plana vitrectomy was performed in conjunction with retinotomy, tumor biopsy, endophotocoagulation, and air-fluid exchange. Vitrectomy was used to decrease the amount of traction secondary to retained vitreous after intraocular surgery. Retinotomy sites were chosen under microscopic control to avoid large caliber retinal vessels. Then a modified tumor-aspiration technique, together with endophotocoagulation and aspiration of intraoperative vitreous hemorrhages, provided an opportunity to sample tumor tissue continually at varied depths. We have added standard vitreous surgery concepts, techniques, and instrumentation to produce vitrectomy retinotomy aspiration biopsy of choroidal tumors. ",0
"Multiple representations of pain in human cerebral cortex. The representation of pain in the cerebral cortex is less well understood than that of any other sensory system. However, with the use of magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography in humans, it has now been demonstrated that painful heat causes significant activation of the contralateral anterior cingulate, secondary somatosensory, and primary somatosensory cortices. This contrasts with the predominant activation of primary somatosensory cortex caused by vibrotactile stimuli in similar experiments. Furthermore, the unilateral cingulate activation indicates that this forebrain area, thought to regulate emotions, contains an unexpectedly specific representation of pain. ",0
"Dysplasia and DNA aneuploidy in a pelvic pouch. Report of a case. A patient with an 18-year history of ulcerative colitis was operated on with colectomy, mucosal proctectomy, ileoanal anastomosis, and an S-type pelvic pouch due to intractable chronic continuous disease. The patient was followed by endoscopic controls and biopsy sampling from the pouch at regular intervals. A gradual development of severe atrophy in the ileal mucosa was followed by the development of low grade dysplasia. At the most recent endoscopic control, 4 years after the construction of the pouch, biopsies were sampled also for flow cytometric DNA analyses. DNA aneuploidy was detected in a biopsy from the center of the pouch, and a biopsy taken immediately adjacent showed low grade dysplasia. These findings underline the importance of endoscopic follow-up after construction of a pelvic pouch and focus attention to the potential of malignant transformation of the mucosa. ",0
"Tympano-cartilago-stapediopexy: a method to improve hearing in open technique tympanoplasty. Canal wall-down technique tympanoplasty was indicated in about 41 per cent of our cases with chronic suppurative otitis media. In this series done during the last four years, of 576 tympanoplasties, 240 cases needed type III tympanoplasty. In 145 cases, myringostapediopexy was carried out using temporalis fascia grafting over the head of the stapes. Tympano-cartilago-stapediopexy was performed in the other 95 cases by using tragal cartilage and perichondrium over the stapes. A comparison between the results of both methods of grafting is discussed. Improvement in hearing was achieved after tympano-cartilago-stapediopexy. This method proved to be suitable for those cases which need open technique tympanoplasty. ",0
"Molecular phenotype of a pediatric small round cell tumor. Molecular probes were used to characterize an unusual small round cell abdominal tumor arising from the fallopian tube of a 15-year-old girl. DNA and RNA extracted from the tumor and adjacent normal tissue was subjected to Southern and Northern blot analysis using a variety of different probes. N-myc oncogene RNA was greatly expressed in the tumor, but was not expressed in normal tissue or amplified in chromosomal DNA. Insulin-like growth factor II RNA was similarly overexpressed in the neoplasm, but not in normal tissue. While histopathologic studies could not distinguish between a neuroectodermal neoplasm and Wilms' tumor, electron microscopy and the pattern of gene expression was most consistent with Wilms' tumor.

"Intraocular lens complications. The authors implanted intraocular lenses (IOL) in 780 eyes and considered complications of this surgery, dividing the complications into intraoperative and postoperative, the latter early and late. The most frequent intraoperative complications were: hyphema, vitreous injury, pupil deformation with an IOL in the anterior chamber (AC), and hyphema and corneal lesions with an IOL in the posterior chamber (PC). Among the early postoperative complications of an IOL in the AC the authors noticed striate keratopathy and uveal flare and postoperative transitory ocular hypertension and striate keratitis with an IOL in the PC. Moreover, in late postoperative complications in AC implantation they observed: cystoid macular edema, bullous keratitis, retinal detachment, late uveitis, opacification of posterior capsule, eccentric displacement of the IOL, and less frequently, cystoid macular edema in PC implantations. The authors prefer IOL implantation in the PC after extracapsular cataract extraction, since this surgery causes less problems in the cornea, vitreous, and retina. ",0
"Cutaneous melanoma and bilateral retinoblastoma. We report the case of an otherwise healthy 37-year-old man who had had bilateral enucleation during early childhood for bilateral retinoblastomas, in addition to two cutaneous melanomas (the first appearing at age 27 years). He also had dysplastic melanocytic nevi and a history of cutaneous melanoma in his mother. Retinoblastoma may aggregate in families and is associated with DNA abnormalities of chromosome 13. Recent reports have emphasized the appearance of second malignancies in retinoblastoma survivors. The second malignancies include osteosarcoma, soft tissue sarcoma, and cutaneous melanoma. Cutaneous melanoma also may aggregate in families, usually in the setting of dysplastic melanocytic nevi. The features of this case and of similar reported cases suggest that there may be a greater than expected association between retinoblastoma and cutaneous melanoma. ",0
"Abdominal wall reconstruction (the ""mutton chop"" flap). Reconstruction of full-thickness abdominal wall defects can be a difficult surgical challenge. Reconstructing the epigastrium may be especially vexing. The use of prosthetic mesh has significant drawbacks, and the use of pedicled myofascial and myocutaneous flaps should be advantageous. We present 15 consecutive cases demonstrating highly successful reconstructions of massive abdominal wall defects using myofascial and myocutaneous flaps without prosthetic mesh. The extended rectus femoris flap, or ""mutton chop"" flap, which is capable of resurfacing the epigastrium, is described. Complications were minimal, and use of myofascial units, particularly the rectus femoris, should be considered as the technique of choice for reconstruction of major abdominal wall deficits. ",0
Therapeutic embolization: enhanced radiolabeled monitoring. Radiolabeling of Ivalon (polyvinyl alcohol sponge) particles permits localization of injected particles during embolization through the use of a portable gamma camera and provides a means to prevent potentially fatal complications such as pulmonary embolization. A more efficient technique of labeling Ivalon particles with technetium-99m sulfur colloid was developed. An increase in labeling efficiency allowed more accurate determination of the distribution of injected Ivalon particles. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated the stability of the Ivalon particles during this new labeling process. Two patients with arteriovenous malformations underwent therapeutic embolization with radiolabeled Ivalon particles; gamma camera imaging of the lesion and chest was performed throughout the procedure. ,0
"Surrogate receptor-mediated cellular cytotoxicity against malignant human glioma cells. A method for incorporating palmitate-derivatized antibody molecules into effector cells and the influence of these incorporated antibodies (surrogate receptors) on the lytic potential of peripheral blood lymphocytes is described. This surrogate receptor-mediated cellular cytotoxicity provides a means by which killer cells are directed specifically to the desired target glioma cells. The cytotoxic activity does not require the Fc region of the incorporated antibody molecules and shows more lytic potential than ordinary antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. By complement-mediated cell depletion and Percoll gradient separation, the effector cell populations for surrogate receptor-mediated cellular cytotoxicity are found to be natural killer cells, as in the murine system. This strategy of surrogate receptor incorporation into effector cells may provide not only valuable insights into the mechanism of cell-mediated cytotoxicity, but also a means of generating target-specific effector cells for clinical applications in neurosurgery.

"Inflammatory pseudotumor of intra-abdominal lymph nodes manifesting as recurrent fever of unknown origin: a case report. A 27-year-old man presented with a 7-month history of debilitating recurrent fever and weight loss. Extensive clinical evaluation led to the discovery of splenomegaly and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. The patient underwent splenectomy as well as liver and lymph node biopsy. Histologic examination of the lymph nodes, but not the liver and spleen, revealed inflammatory pseudotumor of lymph nodes. The patient has remained asymptomatic for more than 3 years following the surgical procedure despite the absence of further intervention. Inflammatory pseudotumor of lymph nodes should be considered in the differential evaluation of prolonged or relapsing fever of unknown etiology. ",0
"Rehabilitation in brain disorders. 1. Basic sciences. This learning module highlights the basic sciences of brain disorders and their relevance to the rehabilitation process. It is part of the chapter on rehabilitation in brain disorders for the Self-Directed Medical Knowledge Program Study Guide for practitioners and trainees in physical medicine and rehabilitation. The chapter is composed of four articles, and each builds on principles established in the others. This article contains essential information on the hierarchy and integration of cerebral neural processes, functional anatomy, and neurochemistry. It also highlights newer advances in brain plasticity and response to injury, at a cellular level and with reference to acute and secondary processes, which will likely be at the forefront of medical management and functional ""damage control"" in the near future. The learner is directed to articles 2, 3, and 4 in this chapter for supporting information. ",0
"Gastrointestinal pathology in adult iron overdose. The gastrointestinal effects of iron overdose have been described in children. They may occur acutely, ranging in severity from mucosal injury to complete infarction, or several weeks later, as obstruction due to stricture formation. They typically occur in the stomach or proximal small bowel. We describe an adult example of both, each occurring in the distal portion of the small intestine. Both patients had ingested enteric-coated iron preparations and both experienced significant, protracted abdominal pain. Thus adults as well as children are at risk for severe gastrointestinal complications after iron overdose. Significant protracted abdominal pain should alert the clinician of its possibility. Damage to distal areas of the bowel can occur with complete sparing of proximal portions particularly if the iron is an enteric-coated preparation. ",0
"Antisocial alcoholics: are there clinically significant diagnostic subtypes? Of 360 alcoholic male inpatients assessed with a diagnostic interview, 106 (29%) were found to have a co-occurring diagnosis of antisocial personality. Of these ASP alcoholics, 86 were further subdivided into those with only ASP and alcoholism (n = 38), those with ASP, alcoholism and drug dependence (n = 30) and those with ASP, alcoholism and depression (n = 18; 9 of whom also had drug abuse). Comparisons among the three antisocial groups indicated that they differed in measures of psychopathology and course and severity of alcoholism. When the ASP groups were compared to an alcoholism only group, an earlier onset, more rapid course and increased percentage of many alcoholism symptoms were found in the ASP groups, confirming the findings of other studies.

"Locked intramedullary nailing of femoral shaft fractures. One hundred twenty-three femoral shaft fractures were treated with Grosse-Kempf slotted, locked nails and followed for a median 20 (range, 12-60) months. There were eight intraoperative and 11 postoperative complications, among them two superficial and two deep infections. Most of the intraoperative complications and some postoperatively lost reductions could have been prevented by a better operative technique and judgment of stability. Seventy-eight results were graded as excellent, 24 as good, 19 as fair, and two as poor (one 9-cm shortening and one 40 degrees external malrotation). All fractures united without further procedures during the first year. ",0
Acute oculogyric crisis after administration of prochlorperazine. We report a case of acute oculogyric crisis due to prochlorperazine administration in a young black woman with a concomitant viral infection. Neuroleptic medications are the most common cause of drug-induced acute dystonic reactions such as oculogyric crisis. Prochlorperazine is an antiemetic agent with a phenothiazine-type chemical structure and is known to cause dystonic reactions. Drug-induced acute dystonic reactions are most common in young adults and in men. Viral infections may also predispose patients to these adverse reactions. Caution is warranted when this drug is used in patients who have other risk factors for an acute dystonic reaction. ,0
"Use of monoclonal antibody KP1 for identifying normal and neoplastic human mast cells. The monoclonal antibody KP1 (CD68) was used to stain normal and neoplastic monocytes and macrophages in routinely processed, paraffin wax embedded tissue: mast cells also exhibited strong, consistent cytoplasmic immunoreactivity. Light microscopic findings were corroborated by electron microscopical and immunocytochemical findings. The predominant sites of immunoreactivity were the specific intracytoplasmic granules of the mast cells. All mast cell subtypes--that is, normal and reactive mast cells, such as those in lymph nodes exhibiting chronic non-specific lymphadenitis, and malignant or neoplastic mast cells in various types of mastocytosis--reacted with this antibody. This finding is of diagnostic importance, because mast cell proliferation could be mistaken for histiocyte proliferation. It also supports the hypothesis that mast cells derive from the bone marrow.

"Narrow excision (1-cm margin). A safe procedure for thin cutaneous melanoma. We analyzed the results at 8 years of an international, randomized, prospective study carried out by the World Health Organization Melanoma Programme aimed at evaluating the efficacy of 1-cm-margin excision of primary melanomas not thicker than 2 mm. Data for 612 patients were assessable; 305 were randomized to receive 1-cm-margin excision and 307 to receive wide excision (margins of greater than or equal to 3 cm). The major prognostic criteria were similar in the two groups. Breslow thickness was 0.99 mm in the narrow excision group and 1.02 mm in the wide excision group. Disease-free and overall survival rates (mean follow-up period, 90 months) were similar in the two groups. Only four patients had a local recurrence as a first relapse. All underwent narrow excision, and each had primary melanomas thicker than 1 mm. ",0
"Routine and quantitative EEG analysis in Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome. Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome (GdlT) is a neurobehavioral disorder, with a reportedly high frequency of EEG abnormalities. We performed EEGs on 48 consecutive patients with GdlT, and frequency analysis in 26 patients (17 males), and compared the results with those from age- and sex-matched normal controls. Routine 18-channel EEG revealed minimal diffuse nonspecific slowing in only 3 of 48 patients (6%) and in 2 of 26 controls (7.7%). The frequency analysis of the EEG of the 26 GdlT patients and their normal controls showed similar brain activity. We conclude that no significant differences exist between the EEG activity in GdlT patients as compared with that in sex- and age-matched controls in routine as well as in quantitative EEG. ",0
"Interphase cytogenetic analysis in the diagnosis and study of neoplastic disorders. Cytogenetic information usually is obtained through the direct analysis of chromosomes from cells arrested in metaphase. Recently, advances in molecular genetics have made it possible to acquire cytogenetic information through the study of interphase and terminally differentiated cells. By using chromosome-specific DNA probes or probes that are specific for certain chromosomal regions, and by employing techniques of in situ hybridization along with nonradioactive detection methods, it is now possible to detect numerical and structural chromosomal abnormalities from nonmetaphase cells. When used as an adjunct to conventional cytogenetic analysis or when used together with knowledge of established cytogenetic findings for a particular malignancy, this new technology can serve to broaden the scope and utility of cytogenetic analysis beyond the limits of the present metaphase-based technology. Interphase cytogenetic analysis has application to the diagnosis and study of neoplastic disorders and, thus, has particular importance in pathology. ",0
"Potential role of beta-carotene in prevention of oral cancer. Recent data suggests that retinoids and carotenoids may be effective in reversing a putative ""field cancerization"" defect in the epithelium at risk for oral cancer. Animal experiments have shown that these compounds can inhibit cancer formation. Several clinical trials have demonstrated the ability of retinoids to reverse oral leukoplakia. However, toxicities associated with retinoids at the doses used in these studies limits their potential for chemoprevention. Because of its lack of toxicity, beta-carotene is a very attractive agent for chemoprevention. It suppresses micronuclei in exfoliated oral mucosal cells from subjects at risk for oral cancer and recently has been shown to be active in reversing leukoplakia. Another area under investigation is the possibility of preventing second primary tumors in patients cured of their initial cancer who have an increased risk of developing new cancers of the upper acrodigestive tract.

"Unusual aspects of aortovenous fistulas associated with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms. Three unusual cases of an abdominal aortic aneurysm spontaneously rupturing into the retroperitoneum and an adherent posterior vein are reported. No patient demonstrated signs or symptoms of an aortovenous fistula before surgery. Emergent surgery prevented extensive preoperative diagnostic testing. The three abdominal aortic aneurysms were very large and averaged 13 cm in diameter. One fistula involved an inflammatory aneurysm, which is the fifth such case reported. The aortic fistulas were to the inferior vena cava (158 other cases reported in the English-language literature), a left renal vein (16 other cases reported), and an iliac vein (7 other cases reported). Routine use of the cell-saver, oversewing of the fistula from within the aneurysm, and a heightened awareness that this unusual complication is more common in the presence of a very large, ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm should improve survival.

"General assay for phosphoproteins in cerebrospinal fluid: a candidate marker for paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. The components of protein phosphorylation systems (protein kinases, protein phosphatases, and their phosphoprotein substrates) are highly enriched in neuronal cells compared with other cell types. We exploited this relative neuronal enrichment of protein phosphorylation system components to develop a general assay technique for putative protein kinase substrates (phosphoproteins) in human cerebrospinal fluid. Using this cerebrospinal fluid phosphoprotein assay, we have detected a putative protein kinase C substrate protein of apparent Mr 60 kd in 6 of 14 patients with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration but not in any of 55 patients with a variety of other neurological diseases. Phosphoproteins in cerebrospinal fluid may provide novel and unique markers for the diagnosis or staging of neuronal diseases as well as offer potential insights into the biochemical characterization of affected neuronal populations.

"Ulnar nerve decompression with medial epicondylectomy for neuropathy at the elbow. Ulnar nerve decompression with medial epicondylectomy was performed in 66 elbows between 1966 and 1986 for compressive ulnar neuropathy at the elbow. This study is an updated review that adds 36 cases to a previously published report on 30 cases. These elbows were graded preoperatively and postoperatively using McGowan's grading system. Eighty-three percent improved one or two grades, and 11% improved subjectively although they showed no objective improvement, 3% noted no change, and 3% were subjectively worse. One early case sustained damage to the ulnar collateral ligament with resultant instability. No other complications occurred. The best results were seen in the Grade I and II lesions, whereas those with Grade III lesions were the least predictable. The procedure is technically uncomplicated with minimal morbidity and reliable results. ",0
"Management of renovascular disease. A surgical perspective. The role of surgical revascularization in the management of patients with renal artery disease has changed in recent years. This has occurred due to the advent of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty as an effective method of treatment for certain patients, improved results of surgical revascularization in older patients with atherosclerosis, an enhanced appreciation of advanced atherosclerotic renal artery disease as a correctable cause of renal failure, and the development of more effective surgical techniques for patients with severe aortic atherosclerosis and branch renal artery disease. Surgical revascularization is currently the treatment of choice for patients with branch renal artery disease, ostial atherosclerotic renal artery disease, a renal artery aneurysm, and patients in whom renal percutaneous transluminal angioplasty has been unsuccessful. Excellent clinical results continue to be achieved with surgical revascularization in properly selected patients. ",0
"Skin exudate levels of interleukin 6, interleukin 1 and other cytokines in mycosis fungoides. The role of locally released cytokines in inducing lymphocyte activation and infiltration in the skin lesions of mycosis fungoides has been investigated. The levels of selected cytokines were measured in chamber fluid samples from lesional and control skin. Biologically active interleukin 6 was significantly elevated in lesional samples and a recombinant form of this cytokine was shown to induce lymphocyte migration in an in vitro assay. Biologically active interleukin 1 was detected in all control chamber fluid samples. Significantly reduced levels of this cytokine were present in lesional samples, which may be the result of the release of preformed material. Interleukin 2 and tumour necrosis factor activity, and gamma interferon and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor immunoreactivity, were not detectable in any of the samples. Interleukins 1 and 6 may play a role in the pathogenesis of the lesional lymphocyte infiltrates in mycosis fungoides. ",0
"Is liver transplantation justified for the treatment of hepatic malignancies? Twenty-eight patients received orthotopic liver transplants for malignant disease between February 1, 1984, and December 31, 1989. Preoperative diagnoses included hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 16), cholangiocarcinoma (n = 3), other primary hepatic tumors (n = 6), and metastatic diseases to the liver (n = 3). Overall actuarial survivals at 6 months, 1 year, and 5 years were 67.3%, 51%, and 31%, respectively. Long-term survival longer than 5 years was achieved in 3 patients. The recurrence rate in patients surviving longer than 3 months is 48% (median, 7 months). Hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma had the poorest survival and highest recurrence rates. Specific prognostic factors correlating with survival or recurrence could not be elucidated. These results indicate that orthotopic liver transplants can provide long-term cure and palliation for malignant disease; however, patient selection is extremely important in predicting outcome. ",0
"Microstaging of squamous cell carcinomas. The clinical classification of squamous cell carcinoma, which was established primarily by the International Union Against Cancer (UICC), does not permit optimal estimation of expected metastasis. The authors' results indicate that metastasis can be more accurately estimated on the basis of invasion depth, histopathologic grading, and especially tumor thickness. One essential advantage of these criteria is that they can be established by a histopathologist. It is interesting to note that in the authors' collective no carcinoma less than 2 mm thick metastasized, that is, a relatively high percentage of carcinomas (48%) can be graded as no-risk carcinomas. The risk of metastasis for undifferentiated carcinomas greater than 6 mm thick that have infiltrated the musculature, the perichondrium, or the periosteum, however, is quite high. Tumors between 2 and 6 mm thick with moderate differentiation and a depth of invasion that does not extend beyond the subcutis can be classified as low-risk carcinomas. ",0
"An autosomal recessive gene that delays expression of lupus in BXSB mice. We report the generation and serologic, cellular, histologic, and genetic characteristics of a BXSB/MpJScr substrain, termed BXSB/MpJScr-ll/ll, that has lost early-life male lupus disease. Classic genetic analysis suggested that delayed disease expression results from the action of a single autosomal recessive gene. This putative gene, referred to as ll (long-lived), causes a significant delay in expression of autoimmune serology (total serum IgG and anti-nuclear antibodies levels), monocytosis, and of immune complex-mediated histopathologic changes such as glomerulonephritis, arteritis, and myocardial infarction. Presumably as a consequence of the delayed immunopathology male BXSB/MpJScr-ll/ll mice live three to four times longer than regular BXSB/MpJScr. This strain might be useful for analysis of single genes responsible for severe autoimmune disease expression. ",0
"Intracatheter streptokinase for recurrent peritonitis in CAPD. Intracatheter streptokinase (SK) is advocated as effective treatment with minimal adverse effects in both recurrent bacterial peritonitis and catheter fibrin blockage in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. We reviewed 35 instillations in 20 patients noting a high (86%) side effect profile consisting of fever, onset of turbid dialysis effluent and/or abdominal pain. SK probably releases fibrin clot containing bacteria, leukocytes and debris from the colonized catheter into the peritoneal cavity causing a ""peritonitis-like syndrome"" of 1 to 3 days duration. Fungal peritonitis occurred after SK in 2 patients. Failure of SK therapy was encountered in Staphylococcus epidermidis infection (p less than 0.05 versus other organisms), which may be related to its protective capsular polysaccharide slime and ability to adhere to plastic prosthetic devices. SK, in this study, was useful treatment in relapsing bacterial peritonitis (50% overall cure) but failed to correct catheter malfunction. ",0
"Isolated ventral pancreatitis in a patient with pancreas divisum. A previously healthy 22-yr-old woman was found to have chronic pancreatitis restricted to the ventral pancreas in association with pancreas divisum. When conservative treatment failed, sphincteroplasty of both papillae was performed with good results. This well-documented case represents a clear exception to the commonly held concept that obstruction of the dorsal duct is the essential pathogenic factor in the development of pancreatitis associated with pancreas divisum. The importance of visualizing both the dorsal and ventral pancreatic ducts to direct therapy for patients with idiopathic pancreatitis is discussed. Theories of the pathogenesis of concomitant pancreatitis and pancreas divisum are reviewed. ",0
"Kenneth McKenzie, Harvey Cushing, and the early neurosurgical treatment of spasmodic torticollis. In 1923, Dr. Kenneth McKenzie trained at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital under Dr. Harvey Cushing. At that time, a patient with spasmodic torticollis came to Cushing and was treated with an innovative operation for this disorder with good results. This case sparked an interest in Dr. McKenzie, who published the case 1 year later. In reviewing the surgical histories from the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, we have found the original records of this well-documented case. The record includes postoperative drawings of the intraoperative field by Dr. Cushing, a sketch by Dr. McKenzie illustrating the postoperative sensory examination, and pre- and postoperative photographs of the patient.

"Defective dystrophin in Duchenne and Becker dystrophy myotubes in cell culture. We examined normal and dystrophic human myotubes in cell culture for expression of dystrophin, the protein product of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy locus. Dystrophin levels in developing myotubes detected by Western blotting increased after 24 hours and reached maximum levels after 10 days in fusion medium. We did not detect dystrophin in myotubes cultured from Duchenne myoblasts (7 cases). Myotubes from a Becker muscular dystrophy patient's biopsy produced a lower molecular weight (approximately 408 kd) dystrophin, which was the same size in a whole muscle preparation from the same biopsy. This 408-kd dystrophin was the expected size for this Becker patient whose DNA was deleted for exons 45-48 of the Duchenne gene. This cell culture system will allow a detailed analysis of the effects of potential pharmacologic agents on steady-state dystrophin levels. ",0
"Transesophageal echocardiography in the diagnosis of ostial left coronary artery stenosis. The diagnosis of ostial stenosis of the left main coronary artery is usually made by use of coronary angiography. However, positioning of the catheter across the obstruction may obscure this diagnosis during contrast injection. Although a damping of arterial pressure when the catheter enters the left coronary artery may suggest ostial stenosis, it may not be possible to make this diagnosis with certainty during cardiac catheterization. We report a series of four patients in whom the left coronary ostium and proximal left coronary arteries were visualized by means of transesophageal echocardiography. Both ostial narrowing by plaque and abnormally fast flow velocities were seen. In each case the echocardiographic findings contributed to the subsequent management of the patients. ",0
"Long-term effects of delapril on renal function and urinary excretion of kallikrein, prostaglandin E2, and thromboxane B2 in hypertensive patients. The effects of delapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on renal function and the renin-angiotensin and kallikrein-prostaglandin systems were investigated in 10 hypertensive patients who were treated for between 4 months and 1 year. There was a significant (P less than .05) increase in renal blood flow (RBF) without affecting glomerular filtration rate. Filtration fraction increased, while renal vascular resistance decreased. There were also significant (P less than .05) increases in urinary kallikrein and prostaglandin excretion, while thromboxane excretion decreased. There was no change in urinary aldosterone excretion. These results suggest that renal hemodynamic changes seen during long-term therapy with delapril are caused, in part, by activation of the kallikrein-prostaglandin system, as well as suppression of the renin-angiotensin system.

"Management of hypertension by reduction in sympathetic activity. The sympathetic nervous system may initiate or maintain hypertension, and a range of approaches that reduce sympathetic activity is often of value in management. These may include nonpharmacological methods, such as the various forms of behavioral therapy (e.g., meditation, relaxation, and biofeedback techniques); weight reduction and avoidance of particular foods and agents that stimulate sympathetic activity (including caffeine and alcohol), and regular physical exercise. Pharmacological therapy includes centrally acting drugs such as alpha-methyldopa, clonidine, and reserpine; ganglionic blockers such as hexamethonium; agents acting on sympathetic nerve terminals such as guanethidine and debrisoquine; and drugs that may act at multiple sites, such as the beta-adrenergic blockers. The role of reducing sympathetic activity in the current management of hypertension and its complications is considered in this overview. ",0
"Surgery for acute and chronic cholecystitis. Cholecystostomy and cholecystectomy remain appropriate and effective therapy for acute and chronic cholecystitis. Cholecystectomy is the gold standard against which all alternative methods of treatment of inflammatory biliary stone disease should be judged. The pathogenesis, diagnosis, and surgical treatment of acute and chronic cholecystitis have been described. Techniques of cholecystostomy, cholecystectomy, and intraoperative cholangiography used by the author have been given. Our results and those generally described in the literature indicate that the overall mortality rate for cholecystectomy, in all age groups, is approximately 0.5%. This rate increases slightly in patients with acute cholecystitis and in those over the age of 65 years. Cholecystectomy remains the most effective and the definitive treatment for acute and chronic cholecystitis. ",0
"Bleeding gastroesophageal varices: gastric vein embolization after partial portal decompression. Shunts that decompress the portal vein are effective in the treatment of bleeding esophageal varices. Use of large-caliber portacaval shunts, however, results in the complete decompression of the portal system and the risk of subsequent development of hepatic encephalopathy. Use of small-caliber portacaval shunts results in mild portal hypertension and less frequent hepatic encephalopathy but may increase the risk of recurrent bleeding. Thirty-three patients underwent angiography after partial decompression portacaval shunting (median trans-shunt pressures, 8 mm Hg). Embolization of residual varices, noted in 13 patients, was performed. Results included one complication with no sequelae and no bleeding a mean of 13 months after the procedure was performed. Trans-shunt embolization of esophageal varices effectively prevents bleeding varices after partial portal decompression. ",0
"Delayed onset of cardiac arrhythmias from sustained-release verapamil. Sustained-release products in overdose are known to produce prolonged effects as well as delayed onset. The availability of sustained-release calcium channel blockers may produce an initial misleading picture for patients who are at risk for serious toxicity. We report the cases of two adults who had delayed onset of arrhythmias after ingestion of sustained-release verapamil. In both cases, a single dose of activated charcoal was administered, but the patients still developed toxicity. Some of the unique problems encountered with sustained-release formulations are discussed, and 24-hour cardiac monitoring for sustained-release calcium channel blocker overdoses, despite a possible early asymptomatic period, is suggested.

"Polyglucosan body disease. Adult polyglucosan disease has been described in 15 cases. All had signs of peripheral neuropathy, upper motor neuron signs, and 12 of the 15 had sphincter problems. Dementia was prominent in 8 of 15 cases. We reported 2 cases that contained these clinical features. Electrophysiological studies showed axonal neuropathy. Somatosensory evoked potentials on the second patient were abnormal. Sural nerve biopsy showed clusters of polyglucosan bodies. Although the presence of polyglucosan bodies in biopsy is nonspecific, the number as well as the clinical features are necessary to make the diagnosis. Branching enzyme activity in muscle extracts of the muscles were normal. Hence, a specific enzyme abnormality is not yet known. ",0
"Plasma cell granuloma of the nasal cavity treated by radiation therapy. Plasma cell granuloma is a rare, benign tumor most commonly found in the lungs in patients younger than 30 years. Although presentation has been reported at a number of other anatomic sites, this report is the first of plasma cell granuloma of the nasal cavity. The tumor was initially resected, but progression was seen at 1-month follow-up. Because further surgery to completely eradicate the tumor would have been extensive and disfiguring, 40-Gy external beam radiation was given in 20 fractions using a three-field wedge technique. Most recent clinical follow-up at 27 months showed local control. Surgery remains the treatment of choice for plasma cell granuloma when the disease can be completely resected. However, irradiation can also be effective in patients with recurrent or inoperable local disease. ",0
"The recalcitrant perineal wound after rectal extirpation. Applications of muscle flap closure. Perineal wounds developing after abdominoperineal resection result in chronic purulent drainage and intermittent episodes of sepsis and are generally unresponsive to conservative medical and surgical treatment. Thirteen consecutive patients (aged 27 to 74 years; mean, 48 years) who underwent debridement and immediate muscle flap closure of these wounds were analyzed to identify risk factors for delayed healing and to evaluate the effectiveness of muscle flap coverage. Three risk factors were identified: preoperative or postoperative radiation therapy, resection for recurrent carcinoma, and inflammatory bowel disease. A total of 19 muscle flaps (11 gracilis, five gluteal thigh, two gluteus maximus, and one rectus abdominis) were used to close these wounds. During an average 3.5-year follow-up, four (31%) minor complications and one (8%) recurrence were noted to occur. Muscle flaps provide safe, effective, single-stage procedures for the closure of chronic perineal wounds. ",0
"Surgical correction of hydrothorax from diaphragmatic eventration in children on peritoneal dialysis. Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is frequently used in the pediatric age group for reversible and end-stage renal failure. Most pediatric patients tolerate this therapy with few complications. Approximately 2% of children, however, develop massive unilateral hydrothorax. This major complication usually results in the discontinuation of peritoneal dialysis in all forms and the institution of hemodialysis. Occult diaphragmatic defects account for most adult and pediatric patients who develop this complication. Three pediatric patients receiving CAPD complicated by massive hydrothorax are described. All patients were successfully treated by thoracotomy and repair of the diaphragmatic eventration with an immediate return to CAPD. This is the first report of successful therapy of this kind in children. A review of the cause, diagnosis, and treatment of massive hydrothorax developing during CAPD therapy is presented. ",0
"Progressive coma after the transsphenoidal decompression of a pituitary adenoma with marked suprasellar extension: report of two cases. Two cases of neurological deterioration and coma after the transsphenoidal decompression of a pituitary adenoma with marked suprasellar extension and invasion of the 3rd ventricle are presented. Emergency ventricular shunting led to prompt neurological improvement, which, supplemented by radiation therapy, allowed long-term amelioration of symptoms. Three possible explanations for this complication are offered: 1) traction of the attached 3rd ventricle into the decompression site, causing increased obstructive hydrocephalus, 2) vasopressin release by surgical manipulation of the pituitary stalk and circumventricular organs causing cerebral edema, and 3) edema in the residual tumor secondary to surgical manipulation causing further hydrocephalus. Subsequent patients with similar clinical and imaging criteria will have a planned perioperative ventricular shunting procedure performed. ",0
"Cytologic features of poorly differentiated 'insular' carcinoma of the thyroid, as revealed by fine-needle aspiration biopsy. The authors report on the cytologic features of six cases of poorly differentiated ""insular"" carcinoma (IC) of the thyroid, a recently described variety of thyroid tumor intermediate between well-differentiated and anaplastic neoplasms. It is characterized by trabecular and/or alveolar growth patterns, merging with follicular areas, and by the absence of pleomorphism in the tumor cells. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) materials (both smears and cell-block preparations) from six patients were reviewed after the diagnosis of IC was confirmed on the surgical specimen. The following cytologic features were consistently found: high cellularity and necrotic background; low grade of atypia; trabeculae and/or clusters, possibly associated with microfollicles, of cells with poorly defined cytoplasm; and cytoplasmic vacuoles containing thyroglobulin. Nuclear inclusions and grooving of the nuclear surface were additional features. Preoperative diagnosis suggestive of IC might be of value for planning surgical treatment and subsequent therapy. ",0
"Differences between florid osseous dysplasia and chronic diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis. Florid osseous dysplasia (FOD) is confused in the literature with chronic diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis. Two cases of each condition are presented to demonstrate the differences between them. In FOD, there are multiple lobulated sclerotic masses in several quadrants of the jaws, usually in black females. In some cases, the sclerotic masses are exposed to the oral cavity, resulting in a secondary osteomyelitis. Periapical cemental dysplasia is often found in association with FOD. Chronic diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis is a primary inflammatory condition of the mandible. Patients have cyclic episodes of unilateral pain and swelling. The affected region of the mandible exhibits a diffuse opacity with poorly defined borders. Although women are affected more often than men, black persons are not particularly susceptible. ",0
"Supported employment: an alternative model for vocational rehabilitation of persons with severe neurologic, psychiatric, or physical disability. Participation in paid work in competitive industry through placement in supported employment is compared and analyzed for 278 severely disabled persons. Differential outcomes are described for persons with chronic mental illness, cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injury, and dual diagnosis of chronic mental illness and mental retardation. Results indicated that supported employment appears to be an effective means of assisting these historically unemployable individuals to acquire and retain work. Cross-disability group differences were found in areas such as hourly wages, type of employment, services provided by employment specialists, and job retention. The results represent a baseline from which to evaluate future efforts at competitive work placement for persons with severe disabilities, using the supported-employment model. ",0
"A diagnostic expert system for colonic lesions. The diagnostic expert system for colonic lesions (DESCL) was designed to discriminate colonic adenoma and adenocarcinoma from normal colonic tissue. Although it was originally developed for use in conjunction with a machine vision analytic system, the DESCL has evolved into a teaching tool and a model for conceptual machine learning. The expert system is table driven and consists of a shell and a knowledge base. The latter comprises a series of architectural and cytologic observations and a quantitative estimate of diagnostic importance relating these observations to diagnostic outcome. In a validation study of 100 colonic lesions, the expert system achieved a success rate of 98%. It has the flexibility to allow individual pathologists to ""customize"" the knowledge base to suit their diagnostic criteria. ",0
"Pharmacologic stress imaging. Pharmacologic stress imaging has increasingly been employed as an alternative to exercise imaging for detection of coronary artery disease and risk stratification particularly in patients who are unable to perform adequate exercise. Sensitivity and specificity of thallium 201 scintigraphy using intravenous dipyridamole infusion as a stress for coronary artery disease detection average 85% and 91%, respectively. Dipyridamole imaging is also useful for differentiating between ischemia and scar and identifying patients who have an increased risk for subsequent cardiac events. Dipyridamole imaging is particularly useful for preoperative risk stratification in patients undergoing surgery for peripheral vascular or aortic disease. Dipyridamole imaging is also useful for identifying residual myocardial ischemia after myocardial infarction and detecting restenosis after coronary angioplasty. Adverse side effects of dipyridamole are promptly reversed by aminophylline. Dipyridamole stress can also be employed in association with echocardiography for detection of ischemia-induced regional wall motion abnormalities. ",0
"A histopathologic study of spinal cord ischemia using an isohistogenic rat upper-half-body transplantation model. To study the histopathologic changes of spinal cords exposed to long-duration complete ischemia, the authors developed an upper-half-body transplantation model of inbred rat. In this model, an infant Lewis rat is transplanted to the inguinal region of another adult Lewis rat using microsurgical vascular anastomosis. Even when 2-week-old donor rats were exposed to complete ischemia for 90 minutes, functions of the spinal cord were comparatively preserved. In histopathologic observations, degeneration proportional to complete ischemia duration was noted. In the 60-minute ischemia group of 2-week-old donor rats, however, no substantial differences from normal spinal cord were observed. Under conditions of equal ischemia duration, it appeared the younger animal had the greater ischemic tolerance. ",0
"The incidence of deep vein thrombosis after cementless and cemented knee replacement. The incidence of deep vein thrombosis in 244 patients who had total knee replacement has been studied. In 120 the prosthesis was cemented and in 124 it was cementless. In all cases the replacement was primary and a porous-coated prosthesis with a porous-coated central tibial stem was used. Deep vein thrombosis was diagnosed by venography, and pulmonary embolism by perfusion scanning. The incidence of deep vein thrombosis in the cementless knees (23.8%) and in the cemented (25%) was approximately the same. The only significant predisposing factors for deep vein thrombosis in both groups were obesity, prolonged postoperative immobilisation, previous venous disease and hyperlipidaemia. ",0
"Reduction in bleeding after heart-lung transplantation. The importance of posterior mediastinal hemostasis. To reduce perioperative hemorrhage following heart-lung transplantation, several technical modifications were introduced in June 1988 to secure better posterior mediastinal hemostasis. The intraoperative and postoperative use of blood and blood products, as well as the chest tube drainage in the first 24 hours postoperatively, were compared in the seven patients operated on since June 1988 with the nine patients operated on before that date. Significant (p less than 0.05) reductions were demonstrated in the intraoperative and postoperative transfusion of packed cells, in the postoperative administration of fresh frozen plasma, and in the chest tube drainage within the first 24 hours postoperatively. The one-month and total hospital mortality rates were 6 percent and 12.5 percent, respectively. It is concluded that newer techniques to obtain optimal posterior mediastinal hemostasis have significantly reduced blood loss following heart-lung transplantation in our experience and have contributed to our excellent early postoperative results.

"Neuroendocrine carcinoma of the ampulla of vater. A case of absence of somatostatin in a vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-, bombesin-, and cholecystokinin-producing tumor. A 31-year-old patient with a clinical picture of obstructive jaundice had surgical treatment, and a primary carcinoid of the ampulla of Vater (VA) was found. The tumor was studied with light microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy. The neoplasm had histopathologic and cytopathologic features similar to those encountered in typical neuroendocrine neoplasms. It is interesting that immunohistochemical techniques disclosed the presence of vasointestinal polypeptide, cholecystokinin, and bombesin; however, unlike most neuroendocrine neoplasms arising in VA, no somatostatin-immunoreactive cells were found.

"Co-trimoxazole for childhood febrile illness in malaria-endemic regions. The efficacy of co-trimoxazole for the treatment of Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia in children younger than 5 years of age was evaluated in Malawi. 46 children with P falciparum parasitaemia, 37% of whom also met clinical criteria for a diagnosis of acute lower respiratory tract infection, were treated with 20 mg/kg co-trimoxazole twice daily for five days. Parasitaemia (mean clearance time 2.7 days) and symptoms were rapidly abolished and improvement was maintained during follow-up for 14 days. Co-trimoxazole may be an effective single treatment for febrile illness in young children in areas where malaria is endemic, resources are few, and diagnosis must rely on clinical findings alone. ",0
"Immunohistochemical investigations of estrogen receptors in normal and neoplastic squamous epithelium of the vulva. Atrophic disease of the vulvar epithelium can be treated with steroids, but carcinoma of the vulva cannot be influenced with any hormone therapy. Seventy-one vulvar specimens were tested for estrogen receptor (ER) content by means of immunohistochemistry. Slight ER staining was found in nonkeratinizing squamous epithelium in 17 of 22 cases. A weak ER reaction in the basal and parabasal layers was found in only 2 of 17 specimens of keratinizing squamous epithelium. However, no ER was found in any neoplastic tissue of the vulva or the adjacent stroma. The loss of ER in neoplastic cells could explain the clinical experience that antihormonal treatment of vulvar carcinomas produces no appreciable improvement. ",0
"Spinal accessory nerve palsy: an unusual complication of coronary artery bypass The neurologic complications of coronary artery bypass surgery have been well documented, with a reported incidence of 61% in one large study. Most injuries to the peripheral nervous system involve the brachial plexus. We report the first case of a spinal accessory nerve lesion after coronary bypass surgery. The patient presented with progressive right shoulder weakness. Electrodiagnostic studies revealed a partial lesion of the right spinal accessory nerve. Physical therapy, including strengthening, range of motion, and electric stimulation to the right shoulder, was prescribed to assist recovery of strength and function. Repeat electrodiagnostic studies confirmed nerve regeneration. Prompt recognition of spinal accessory nerve damage after coronary bypass surgery is essential. Early rehabilitation will improve the chances of a better functional outcome. ",0
"Preferential mitogenic activity for myoblast-like cells can be extracted from uterine leiomyoma tissues. The presence of mitogen(s) in leiomyoma extracts stimulating cells with the fibroblast, myoblast, and osteoblast phenotype was documented. Mitogenic activity in leiomyoma extracts was acid stable and sensitive to tryptic digestion. Reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography successfully separated mitogen(s) with preferential activity for myoblast cells from mitogens with a broad type of cell specificity and from inhibitors. This leiomyoma-derived preferential activity for myoblasts was absent in identically treated myometrial and endometrial extracts. This suggests that leiomyoma-derived substances with preferential growth factor activity for myoblast-like cells may play a role in the pathophysiologic characteristics of uterine leiomyomas. ",0
"Levels of mRNA for a putative kainate receptor are affected by seizures. In situ hybridization and RNA blot-hybridization techniques were used (i) to examine the regional distribution of mRNA for a putative kainate receptor in adult rat brain and ii) to test the possibility that seizures affect expression of the receptor gene. The highest densities of hybridization were distributed within hippocampal pyramidal and granule cells, medial habenula, Purkinje cells and the molecular layer of cerebellum, and olfactory bulb. Recurrent limbic seizures caused a massive, delayed, and reversible reduction in levels of the kainate receptor mRNA in dentate gyrus; lesser decreases were found in pyramidal cell fields of hippocampus and superficial cortex. These findings provide evidence that unusual patterns of physiological activity can alter genomic expression for a subclass of glutamate receptors in brain. ",0
"Evaluating oxygen delivery and oxygen utilization with mixed venous oxygen saturation monitoring: a case study approach. Three cases studies are presented to demonstrate clinical application of mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) monitoring in critical care nursing practice. Examples of critically ill patients are used to demonstrate how SvO2 monitoring can be used in clinical practice to reflect an imbalance between oxygen delivery and oxygen utilization. In the first case, the patient had a problem with oxygen delivery. Continuous SvO2 data aided nurses in guiding, adjusting, and assessing therapy. The second case demonstrates how SvO2 monitoring can provide an early sign of a life-threatening complication. The final case is one in which the patient had a problem with oxygen utilization. In all the cases, continuous SvO2 data provided important information about the balance between oxygen delivery and oxygen utilization. ",0
"Association of Escherichia coli HEp-2 adherence patterns with type and duration of diarrhoea. 373 (59%) out of 636 faecal specimens obtained during the first 2 years of life of 72 Mexican children yielded adherent Escherichia coli (HEp-2 cells). Strains with localised adherence were significantly associated with acute non-bloody diarrhoea, whereas strains with aggregative adherence were significantly associated with persistent diarrhoea. Half the strains with localised adherence were not enteropathogenic E coli serotypes nor did they hybridise with an enteropathogenic E coli adherence factor DNA probe. All strains with localised adherence gave a positive fluorescent actin staining (FAS) assay, irrespective of serotype. One-third of children colonised by aggregative strains had bloody diarrhoea. Isolation of strains with diffuse adherence was not related to type or duration of diarrhoea but was generally associated with isolation of another pathogenic organism. ",0
"The Van Nes tibial rotationplasty. A functionally viable reconstructive procedure in children who have a tumor of the distal end of the femur. Twelve patients who had a malignant tumor of the distal end of the femur were treated with a Van Nes tibial rotationplasty. The survival rates were comparable with those for above-the-knee amputees and patients who had an endoprosthetic replacement. The results of functional testing showed that these patients performed as well as those who had endoprosthetic replacement and better than those who had above-the-knee amputation. Rotationplasty is therefore a favorable alternative to amputation or endoprosthetic replacement, either as a primary or as a salvage procedure. ",0
Acute oculogyric crisis after administration of prochlorperazine. We report a case of acute oculogyric crisis due to prochlorperazine administration in a young black woman with a concomitant viral infection. Neuroleptic medications are the most common cause of drug-induced acute dystonic reactions such as oculogyric crisis. Prochlorperazine is an antiemetic agent with a phenothiazine-type chemical structure and is known to cause dystonic reactions. Drug-induced acute dystonic reactions are most common in young adults and in men. Viral infections may also predispose patients to these adverse reactions. Caution is warranted when this drug is used in patients who have other risk factors for an acute dystonic reaction. ,0
"Choroid plexus tumors in the breast cancer-sarcoma syndrome. Choroid plexus neoplasms are rare epithelial tumors of the central nervous system. A carcinoma of the choroid plexus occurred in a child from a family with the breast cancer-sarcoma syndrome (Li-Fraumeni or SBLA syndrome), an inherited condition characterized by the development of diverse neoplasms (sarcoma, breast cancer, brain tumors, leukemia, adrenal cortical carcinoma, and others). Choroid plexus carcinomas were identified in two kindreds previously reported with the syndrome. The literature contains reports of choroid plexus neoplasms occurring in families and in individuals with multiple primary tumors. Choroid plexus neoplasm may be a manifestation of the inherited proclivity to tumor development in the breast cancer-sarcoma syndrome. ",0
"Simultaneous superior oblique sheathectomy and inferior oblique tuck in congenital Brown's syndrome. Since Harold Brown, in 1950, described the superior oblique tendon sheath syndrome, numerous surgical techniques have been explored to treat this condition. Tenectomy of the homolateral superior oblique, alone or in combination with a weakening procedure on the homolateral inferior oblique, has been the technique most advocated. However, good functional results are rarely achieved in a single procedure, and delayed complications are frequent. Taking advantage of the improved dissection and reduced trauma afforded by the use of a surgical microscope, one of the techniques first recommended and later abandoned by Brown was reappraised. The technique consists of dissection of the sheath and attachments of the superior oblique, while preserving its tendon, combined with a 10mm tuck of the homolateral inferior oblique. Both a typical and a severe atypical congenital case, according to the classification of Brown, were treated in this fashion. Full correction was achieved in both. ",0
"Oral contraceptives, lipoproteins, and atherosclerosis. A nonhuman primate model was developed to study the effects of oral contraceptives on lipoproteins and atherosclerosis. Cynomolgus macaques were selected because of their susceptibility to diet-induced atherosclerosis and because their reproductive physiology, menstrual cycle, and circulating sex hormone patterns are similar to those of human females. The first study compared a vaginal ring containing levonorgestrel and estradiol with an oral contraceptive containing norgestrel and ethinyl estradiol. A second study compared two oral combinations: norgestrel-ethinyl estradiol and ethynodiol diacetate-ethinyl estradiol. As predicted, use of all the contraceptives led to lowering of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. However, contrary to what might be expected, use of the ethinyl estradiol-containing oral contraceptives did not lead to an increase in the prevalence or extent of atherosclerosis. We concluded that ethinyl estradiol neutralized the atherogenic influence of the progestin component of oral contraceptives. ",0
"Clinical observation on the association of gallstones and colorectal cancer. A possible association between gallstones, colorectal cancer, and gastric cancer was investigated. The age distribution and mean age of the two cancer groups were identical. The incidence of gallstones in 378 colorectal cancer cases and 869 gastric cancer cases was 7.1% and 5.5%, respectively. Of colorectal cancer cases, 33 cases with multiple carcinomas had a significantly higher gallstone incidence than cases with a solitary carcinoma--24.2% and 5.5%, respectively. The mean age was 5 years older in gallstone cases than in those without gallstones in both cancer groups, and it was 4 years older in multiple-carcinoma cases than in solitary-carcinoma cases in the colorectal cancer group. These results suggest that the higher levels of same causative factors (i.e., dietary fat) are associated with a longer duration of gallstone formation and colorectal cancer development as demonstrated by multiple colorectal-carcinoma cases.

"Warner-Lambert/Parke-Davis Award lecture. Pathobiology of the intestinal epithelial barrier. The major route of passive permeation across intestinal epithelia is paracellular. The intercellular tight junction lies in and serves as the rate-limiting barrier in this paracellular pathway. Once viewed as static, it is now clear that the structure and permeability of the tight junction is highly dynamic. Not only may inflammatory events (cytokines, neutrophil transmigration) reversibly effect the tight junction but this key barrier also is regulated by physiologic events such as activation of absorptive cell Na(+)-nutrient cotransporters. Such physiologic regulation of the junction is of major importance to the absorption of nutrients via parcellular solvent drag. ",0
"Celiac disease, brain atrophy, and dementia. We report 5 patients who developed dementia before age 60 and were subsequently found to have celiac disease (CD). Intellectual deterioration ranged from moderate to severe, and diffuse cerebral or cerebellar atrophy was found on brain CT. Diagnosis of CD was confirmed by findings of subtotal villous atrophy in jejunal biopsy specimens and positive serum reticulin and gliadin antibodies. Conspicuously, gastrointestinal symptoms were mild. The gluten-free diet failed to improve the neurologic disability except in 1 patient. CD is a multisystem disorder and may play a role in some cases of presenile dementia. Although the pathogenetic mechanisms are obscure, immunologic mechanisms are implicated. ",0
"Toward a rational therapeutic strategy for arachnoiditis. A possible role for d-penicillamine. Twenty-six patients (13 men and 13 women), ranging in age from 38 to 75 years, with surgical and/or radiculographic evidence of chronic adhesive spinal arachnoiditis (CASA) were admitted to a randomly allocated, double-blind, 6-month crossover trial of d-penicillamine (500 mg/day) versus matching placebo. Assessments using subjective and objective criteria at 3-month intervals demonstrated no statistically significant effect with either d-penicillamine or placebo or between them. Thirteen of the 17 patients completing the trial expressed no clear preference. One patient preferred placebo. The remaining three patients who expressed strong preference for d-penicillamine (supported by objective data) subsequently maintained improvement on long-term therapy for up to 5 years. It is concluded that there may be a small subgroup of patients with CASA who might benefit from d-penicillamine therapy. ",0
"Increasing the cancer screening of the medically underserved in south Florida. Diagnosis and treatment of cancers at advanced stages have contributed to a significantly lower survival rate among individuals of low socioeconomic status compared with those in higher brackets. In an effort to increase the accessibility and acceptability of cancer screening among such individuals in Dade County, Florida, the Cancer Control Division of the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Miami School of Medicine initiated a pilot early detection program in 1987. The program initially provided breast cancer screening for women, aged 40 and older, who attended ten community health care centers located in low-income neighborhoods. With the selection of Miami by the American Cancer Society as one of three sites for conducting a screening demonstration project for the socioeconomically disadvantaged, this program has recently been expanded to include pelvic screening for women, aged 40 and older, and prostate screening for men, aged 65 and older.

"Use of intravenous stilbestrol diphosphate in patients with prostatic carcinoma refractory to conventional hormonal manipulation. The patient presenting with severe bone pain after primary hormonal therapy, with vertebral collapse, or with uremia resulting from ureteric obstruction should be considered for intravenous stilbestrol diphosphate therapy. The urologist can expect early marked improvement in the patients' mobility and pain, with a reduction in analgesic requirements, from a single 7-day course of treatment. In addition, the drug is inexpensive and free of the side effects commonly associated with cytotoxic therapy. Accurate monitoring of the response is possible with serum prostate-specific antigen measurements, which also enable further therapy to be planned efficiently. ",0
"Outcome of cataract surgery in central India: a longitudinal follow-up study. An epidemiological follow-up study of patients who had intracapsular cataract extraction in a voluntary hospital and its associated eye camps in Central India has for the first time evaluated the outcome one year after surgery in terms of visual acuity, use of spectacles, and improvement in income and mobility. The findings indicate that under these fairly typical conditions, 92% of the cases have adequate vision of 6/18 or better one year after surgery. Information on high usage of spectacles and on considerable improvements in income and mobility after cataract surgery is also reported. The outcome for patients operated upon in eye camps was almost as favourable as for those operated upon in hospital. Although the small differences are not statistically significant, the comparative findings require cautious interpretation and give rise to the epidemiological issues which are briefly discussed in this paper.

"Computed tomography staging of the paranasal sinuses in chronic hyperplastic rhinosinusitis. In this study, the computed tomography scans of 100 patients with chronic hyperplastic rhinosinusitis were reviewed to establish a clinical staging system. Fourteen percent of the patients were classified as Stage I (single-focus disease); 36% as Stage II (multifocal disease responsive to conservative therapy); 32% as Stage III (diffuse disease partially responsive to medication); and 16% as Stage IV (diffuse disease associated with bony changes and poorly responsive to conservative treatment). The incidence of recurrent or persistent disease ranged from 13% for Stage II to 30% for Stage IV. Stage I and III patients had 13% and 18% recurrence rates, respectively. Computed tomography staging is shown to be useful in outlining operative strategies and is a reliable prognosticator of the disease process. ",0
"Depression after acute myocardial infarction. The role of primary care physicians in rehabilitation. Depression is a common problem after myocardial infarction. Diagnosis is facilitated by use of the criteria for depression in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and self-rating questionnaires. Treatment may involve both psychological and pharmacologic interventions. The patient's medical status must be carefully assessed before administration of antidepressant medication. All antidepressants are contraindicated immediately after myocardial infarction. When signs and symptoms of depression are exhibited early in the recovery phase, alprazolam (Xanax) may offer advantages over more traditional antidepressants. Further research is necessary to determine the safety of newer antidepressants. ",0
"Dietary predictors of symptom-associated gallstones in middle-aged women. In 1980, 88,837 women aged 34-59 y completed a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire and were followed for 4 y. Four hundred thirty-three women reported a cholecystectomy for recent cholecystitis, and 179 reported unremoved, newly symptomatic gallstones diagnosed by ultrasound or x ray. Among the 59,306 women with Quetelet's index of relative weight less than 25 kg/m2, inverse associations were observed between intakes of vegetable fat and vegetable protein and the risk of reportedly symptomatic gallastones, after adjusting for age, Quetelet's index in 1980, weight change between 1976 and 1980, energy intake, and alcohol intake. The relative risk in the highest quintile of vegetable fat intake, as compared with the lowest quintile, was 0.6 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.4-0.9], and the corresponding relative risk for vegetable protein intake was 0.7 (95% CI, 0.6-0.9). No significant associations were found with energy-adjusted intakes of cholesterol, animal fat, animal protein, carbohydrate, or sucrose. ",0
"Ureteral obstruction and ureteral fistulas after aortofemoral or aortoiliac bypass surgery. Ureteral injury after aortofemoral or aortoiliac bypass surgery has seldom been described in the literature considering the large number of bypass operations performed. Some causative factors, such as the position of the bypass, are obvious while others are less clear. However, no attempt has been made to unify criteria to establish a management protocol. Of 154 cases of ureteral units with ectasia reviewed ureteral fistulas were present in 19. Radiological ureteral obstruction appears to precede fistula formation. Symptoms, time of diagnosis and treatment according to the predominant etiology have been discussed. Etiological (in varying degrees of importance), clinical and diagnostic criteria, together with a management and therapeutic protocol in which early and late lesions are clearly differentiated were established, while bearing in mind that not all radiological obstruction patterns correspond to true ureteral lesions.

"Patient-controlled analgesia in children. We report our experience in introducing patient-controlled analgesia at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow. Twenty-five children used the technique after orthopaedic or general surgery using the Graseby system. The pump was loaded with 1 mg/kg morphine sulphate in 50 ml. A bolus dose of 0.02 mg/kg (1 ml) and a lockout interval of 10 minutes were the initial settings. The dose used, pain and sedation scores, respiratory rate and arterial oxygen saturation were recorded. Ages ranged from 5-15 years (mean 9.6) and the method was used for a mean of 48 hours after operation. Morphine requirements averaged 26 (micrograms/kg)/hour (SD 10.6). Pain control was good and sedation minimal. Adverse effects were few and minor. Education of patients, parents and nurses is essential for its success and safety. The technique is an effective and safe means of providing good quality analgesia in school age children. ",0
"Occurrence of beta-hexachlorocyclohexane in breast cancer patients. The residues of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and neutral organochlorine compounds in breast fat of 44 breast cancer patients and 33 women free of cancer were determined. No statistically significant differences appeared between the two comparison groups with regard to occurrence of PAH compounds. Of the neutral organochlorine compounds, residues of beta-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) were found more frequently in breast cancer patients. After adjusting for age and parity by stepwise logistic regression, beta-HCH remained a significant risk factor of breast cancer. Using a cutoff point for the residue level of beta-HCH in breast adipose tissue of more than 0.1 mg/kg fat, the odds ratio was 10.51 (95% CI, 2.00-55.26). ",0
"Increased cholecystectomy rates in Saudi Arabia Gallstones have become increasingly prevalent in Saudi Arabia, where cholecystectomy is now one of the commonest major abdominal operations. 2854 people underwent cholecystectomy in the 14 hospitals of the country's Eastern Province in the years 1977 to 1986. During this period the overall frequency of cholecystectomy increased by 978%, a finding not explained by the 67% increase in population or the 87% increase in other operations. Simultaneously, the average daily individual consumption of total calories, fat, and sugar increased by 81%, 197%, and 164%, respectively, and consumption of high-fibre grain fell by 75%. This striking increase in the frequency of cholecystectomy, which presumably reflects the incidence of gallstones, cannot be explained by demographic changes and seems more closely linked to the concomitant changes in dietary habits.

"Chronic pain in primary care. Identification and management of psychosocial factors. Chronic pain is a problem of great public health importance that is frequently seen in the primary care setting. Pain chronicity shows a strong association with psychosocial factors. Assessment of these factors should be composed of two parts: (1) psychological factors and (2) psychiatric illness. Psychological factors include all those pain-associated alterations in the patient's environment that reinforce illness behavior. Psychiatric illness includes those syndromes that retard recovery from illness or injury, such as depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and dementia. Psychiatric and psychological interventions can be successfully introduced in the context of a comprehensive rehabilitation effort. Usually these interventions can be accomplished by the family physician in concert with a consultant psychiatrist or psychologist. In severely disabled or resistant patients, referral to a multidisciplinary pain clinic will be necessary. ",0
"Transoesophageal echocardiogram may fail to diagnose perioperative myocardial infarction. We report a case in which a 55-yr-old man undergoing aortocoronary bypass was monitored with electrocardiogram and transoesophageal echocardiogram. Intraoperative electrocardiogram and simultaneous ECG recordings using the Holter monitor showed an ST elevation of greater than 2 mm and new Q wave formation in leads AVF and V5 during skin closure. However, the transoesophageal echocardiogram showed no wall motion abnormalities. No significant haemodynamic abnormalities were observed during the period of intraoperative ECG changes. He was treated with nitroglycerin infusion. Confirmation of a perioperative myocardial infarct was documented by postoperative 12-lead ECG and CPK-MB. A post-operative transthoracic echocardiogram showed a hypokinetic left ventricle with an anteroapical infarct. Thus transoesophageal echocardiography failed to detect an apical wall motion abnormality when the probe was placed at the midpapillary level. This limitation can be overcome by periodically obtaining apical views or by using probes with more than one imaging plane. ",0
Delayed pharyngoesophageal perforation: a complication of anterior spine surgery. Stabilization of the cervical spine is often accomplished via an anterior cervical approach. Bone grafts and/or plates and screws are used to achieve stabilization. Injuries to the pharynx and esophagus are known complications in anterior exposure of the cervical spine. These injuries are manifest in the early postoperative period. Reports of late perforations are very rare. We present four cases of delayed injury to the pharynx and esophagus that resulted in abscess or fistula. We postulate that graft displacement with resulting erosion was responsible for these serious complications. Postoperative odynophagia in patients who undergo anterior cervical fusion warrants evaluation of the bone graft location. Early surgical intervention and repair may decrease prolonged morbidity in these patients. ,0
"A new method for mapping hepatic subsegment: counterstaining identification technique. Hepatic subsegmentectomy requires identification of the borders of tumor-bearing subsegment, usually achieved by injecting dye into the portal veins feeding the domain. We describe an alternative technique for performing systematic subsegmentectomy in patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, in whom hepatic arterial and portal venous embolizations were already performed as a preoperative adjuvant. Under ultrasonic guidance, each of the neighboring portal units is sequentially stained, thus defining the avascular subsegment to be resected as the nonstaining area. This allows the subsegment to be totally resected. This counterstaining identification technique can be used for all subsegments undergoing complete embolization and for other situations in which the usual staining method is impossible because of the presence of arterioportal shunting or portal tumor thrombus.

"Effects of nimodipine on cerebral blood flow and neuropsychological outcome after cardiac surgery. Thirty-five patients undergoing cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) were allocated randomly in a prospective double-blind study to receive either nimodipine 0.5 micrograms kg-1 min-1 or placebo. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured during and immediately after CPB. Neuropsychological tests were performed 6 months after surgery to determine any relationship between ischaemic damage and CBF and administration of nimodipine. There were no differences in CBF between the nimodipine (n = 18) and placebo groups (n = 17). Significant changes in neuropsychological tests were found in six patients tested 6 months after surgery but there were no conclusive signs of ischaemic damage. The nimodipine-treated group performed better in tests of verbal fluency and visual retention, suggesting that some memory functions were preserved better in this group. ",0
"Physiologic and pathologic alterations associated with ultrasonically generated shock waves. Kidneys of 25 dogs were treated with ultrasonic shock waves and examined for both physiologic and pathologic changes. The number of pulses ranged from 2,000 to 8,000. The rate of the shock waves varied from one to 20 pulses per second. The difference in pulse rate did not affect the changes seen either acutely or in the delayed examination of the kidneys during the repair process. The physiologic and pathologic changes which occurred involved the renal tubule to a greater degree than the glomerulus. These alterations were resolving by one week following exposure to the shock waves. ",0
"Efficacy and complications of radiotherapy of anterior visual pathway tumors. A progressive disturbance in visual acuity or visual field, along with an unexplained optic nerve atrophy, suggests the possibility of a tumor. Tumors that frequently affect the anterior visual pathway include primary optic nerve sheath meningiomas, intracranial meningiomas, optic gliomas, pituitary tumors, and craniopharyngiomas. The location of these tumors sometimes prohibits a complete surgical excision that might jeopardize the visual system. Radiation therapy, however, can be beneficial in these cases. This article reviews the indications for radiotherapy of tumors that involve the anterior visual pathway, along with the possible complications. Cases that present the effect of radiation therapy and radiation damage are presented. ",0
"Mechanical measures in the prophylaxis of postoperative thromboembolism in total knee arthroplasty. Total knee arthroplasty patients are at high risk for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Prophylaxis against deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in these patients seems mandatory. Pharmacologic agents such as dextran 40, aspirin, and warfarin are effective but may be associated with significant complications such as drug reaction, bleeding, hematoma, and hemarthrosis. Heparin was not effective and was associated with significant bleeding complications. Mechanical methods such as continuous passive motion and sequential pneumatic compression stockings were without complications and seemed equal to or more effective than pharmacologic agents. Adding warfarin to mechanical methods did not seem to augment the antithromboembolic effect of the mechanical methods. ",0
"Cardiomyopathy associated with the smoking of crystal methamphetamine. The smoking of crystal methamphetamine, or ""ice,"" is a growing drug abuse problem in the United States. The toxic effects of methamphetamine smoking have not been well described. We describe two patients with cardiovascular toxic effects associated with the smoking of crystal methamphetamine. In our first patient, the use of smokeable methamphetamine was associated with the subsequent development of pulmonary edema and a dilated cardiomyopathy. In our second patient, the smoking of crystal methamphetamine likely produced diffuse vasospasm that resulted in acute myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, and death. The recognition of potentially lethal cardiac complications associated with the smoking of crystal methamphetamine is of extreme significance and should be emphasized to potential abusers of this drug.

"Photochemotherapy improves chronic cutaneous graft-versus-host disease. We have used oral psoralen photochemotherapy (PUVA) to treat four patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease of the skin, oral mucosa, and liver, who had responded only partially to long-term immunosuppressive therapy (prednisolone, cyclosporine, azathioprine). PUVA therapy was delivered to the entire skin but not to the oral mucosa, and immunosuppressive therapy was continued in all patients. Two patients' skin lesions improved considerably; the oral lesions healed and did not recur in one. Immunosuppressive therapy could be reduced in these two patients. One patient with sicca signs did not improve. One patient had to interrupt PUVA therapy because of side effects attributed to 8-methoxypsoralen (nausea and vomiting). No flare of acute cutaneous graft-versus-host disease was noted during PUVA therapy. Chronic graft-versus-host disease of the liver did not improve in any patient. ",0
"Spontaneous sump syndrome: Successful treatment by duodenoscopic sphincterotomy. ""Sump syndrome"" is a rare complication of side-to-side choledochoenterostomy operations which develops in the distal, nonfunctioning limb of the common bile duct where lithogenic bile, gastrointestinal contents, and debris accumulate. We report here a patient who developed spontaneous sump syndrome as a result of the formation of choledochoduodenal fistula, and who presented with multiple pyogenic liver abscesses. The patient's symptoms and liver abscesses resolved completely after treatment by endoscopic sphincterotomy and antibiotics. This case demonstrates that sump syndrome may occur spontaneously, that it can be a cause for pyogenic liver abscess formation, and that it may be treated effectively by endoscopic sphincterotomy.

"Aneuploidy in pancreatic insulinomas does not predict malignancy. Nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) ploidy studies with paraffin embedded archival material from 14 pancreatic insulinomas were performed by flow cytometry. Clinical follow-up (2 to 17 years; mean, 8 years) was obtained for all patients. Half of the tumors had a normal DNA histogram and half exhibited an abnormal DNA profile consistent with DNA aneuploidy. Six of the seven patients with aneuploid tumors are alive and disease free (2 to 5 years postresection), and one is alive with metastatic disease. Of the seven patients with tumors showing normal DNA profiles, five are alive and disease free, one is dead of disease, and one is alive with metastatic disease. These data suggest that DNA ploidy analysis is unlikely to provide useful prognostic information for patients with insulinomas. ",0
"Structural and ultrastructural study of the ovary in childhood leukemia after successful treatment. Ovarian biopsy specimens from ten girls (three postmenarcheal) who had undergone antiblastic treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and were in complete remission were examined by light microscope. The biopsy specimens from four of these patients (three postmenarcheal) were also observed by electron microscope. The structural and ultrastructural analysis showed a reduction in the number of follicles which were otherwise normal. No follicles were found in the thin sections from two of the three postmenarcheal girls, whereas normal follicles were observed in the third. The cortical stroma showed moderate to severe signs of fibrosis and changes of capillaries. All of these alterations were more evident in patients where ALL was diagnosed at an older age and this finding suggests that they are at a higher risk for low fertility or early menopause. ",0
"The management of postoperative chylous ascites. A case report and literature review. Chylous ascites remains rare as a complication of surgical intervention. Although therapeutic manoeuvres to control chylous ascites have been developed over the past 20 years, its pathophysiology is poorly understood. Conservative approaches involving dietary restriction of long-chain triglycerides and salt, together with multiple paracenteses, are still the therapies of choice. Persistent chylous ascites may be treated surgically by ligation of leaking lymphatics or implantation of a peritoneovenous shunt once the lymphatic anatomy has been defined by preoperative investigations. We report a case of chylous ascites developing after laparotomy and duodenotomy for obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, which did not respond adequately to medical therapy and was successfully managed by the insertion of a peritoneovenous shunt.

"Effects of supplemental oxygen administration in an infant with pulmonary artery hypertension. In patients with pulmonary disease, pulmonary artery hypertension often occurs as a result of pulmonary artery vasoconstriction, primarily from hypoxia and alveolar hypotension. In this report we describe the hemodynamic effects of breathing supplemental oxygen in a child with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and pulmonary artery hypertension. These hemodynamic effects include an improvement in oxygenation, an increase in systemic vascular resistance, and a decrease in the pulmonary vascular resistance. As a direct result of these changes in vascular resistances, alterations of heart rate, cardiac index, stroke volume, aortic pressure, oxygen consumption, and pulmonary artery pressure have been shown to occur. Oxygen is widely used to treat many physiologic conditions. However, during the administration of supplemental oxygen, rarely do we recognize the hemodynamic changes associated with its use. These hemodynamic effects must be clearly understood and appreciated before oxygen administration in any clinical situation. ",0
Local hypothermia to prolong safe tourniquet time. Local hypothermia was studied as a method to safely prolong tourniquet time for reconstructive procedures of the upper extremity. An ice blanket constructed of flannel cloth and cold gel packs was applied to the limb for 45 minutes preoperatively. Seventy-eight patients were evaluated for complications resulting from hypothermia and prolonged tourniquet application. The duration of continuous tourniquet ischemia averaged two hours and 25 minutes. Intraoperative muscle temperature recordings indicated that the iced limbs were an average of 12.9 degrees cooler than noniced limbs before tourniquet inflation. Electron microscopic studies of biopsied muscle showed no evidence of ischemic changes. There were no postoperative complications associated with prolonged tourniquet inflation or the hypothermia blanket technique. Local hypothermia appears to be a safe and effective method of decreasing the adverse effects of tourniquet ischemia and allowing continuous tourniquet inflation time to extend safely beyond the customary two-hour limit. ,0
"The vagus nerve, gastric secretions, and their relationship to peptic ulcer disease. Although peptic ulcer disease was known to the ancients, the process by which the disease was produced remained a mystery. As advances were made in medicine and science, so too were advances made in the understanding of digestion and gastrointestinal disease. The treatment of peptic ulcer disease improved as our understanding of the digestive process grew. The current surgical treatment for peptic ulcer disease follows the principals articulated by Lester R. Dragstedt, MD, PhD, which he based on his observations in the research laboratory. We present a historical perspective of the role of the vagus nerve in the control of gastric secretions and its relationship to peptic ulcer disease, placing particular emphasis on Dragstedt's contributions.

Factor XIIIa in nodular malignant melanoma and Spitz naevi. The distribution of factor XIIIa-positive dermal dendritic cells was studied in a series of nodular malignant melanomas and compared with that seen in Spitz naevi. Two patterns of distribution were recognizable: (a) diffusely spread through the tumour and (b) located mainly at the periphery of the tumour. These did not correlate with the diagnosis of melanoma or Spitz naevus and the distribution appeared to be a function of growth pattern of the tumour. The diffuse pattern was the most common regardless of diagnosis and the distribution of factor XIIIa-positive cells is the same in malignant melanoma and Spitz naevi. ,0
"Temporal bone findings in two cases of head injury. Temporal bone findings in two cases of head injury are reported. In one patient, longitudinal fractures occurred in both temporal bones, and extended to the middle ear bilaterally. Bleeding was seen in the tympanic cavity, mastoid air cells, internal auditory meatus and facial nerve canal. Bleeding was observed in the scala tympani, cochlear aqueduct and endolymphatic sac, but there were no fractures. In the other patient, bleeding was seen in the internal auditory meatus and facial nerve canal. In the right ear, endolymphatic hydrops was observed in all turns of the cochlea. ",0
"Ascites revealing peritoneal and hepatic extramedullary hematopoiesis with peliosis in agnogenic myeloid metaplasia: case report and review of the literature. A 61-year-old man presented with ascites in the course of agnogenic myeloid metaplasia (AMM). Ascitic fluid was exudative and contained mature and immature leukocytes, erythroid cells, and megakaryocytes as observed on a bone marrow smear. Peritoneal biopsy showed myeloid metaplasia, and liver biopsy revealed intrasinusoidal myeloid metaplasia and peliosis. Ascites cleared after abdominal radiotherapy but treatment resulted in transient aplasia. Subsequently, portal hypertension was demonstrated by hepatic transjugular catheterization. Complications of splenomegaly led to splenectomy and splenorenal shunt followed by fatal acute hepatitis and septic shock. A review of the literature and an analysis of mechanisms of ascites occurring in AMM, especially peritoneal implants of myeloid tissue and occurrence of peliosis in myeloproliferative disorders, are presented.

"CV 205-502--effectiveness, tolerability, and safety over 24-month study. Twenty hyperprolactinemic women (median prolactin [PRL] 2,989 mU/L, range 1,149 to 11,910 mU/L), previously unsuccessfully treated with bromocriptine, were treated in a prospective study, for 3 to 24 months with the new, nonergot, long-acting, dopamine agonist, CV 205-502. Treatment resulted in normalization of PRL in 14 patients, in one daily dose of 0.075 to 0.150 mg of the drug. Three patients were treated in doses above 0.150 mg up to 0.300 mg, but PRL was not normalized during the study. Menstrual function was restored in 15 of 18 amenorrheic patients. Galactorrhea, present in 7 patients, disappeared in 5. Four patients became pregnant and gave birth to healthy children. In conclusion, we found CV 205-502 effective in one daily dose, with good tolerability; it is safe and provides a valuable alternative to the dopamine agonist drugs in use today. ",0
"Serum cholesterol levels and survival in elderly hypertensive patients: analysis of data from the European Working Party on High Blood Pressure in the Elderly. The relation between serum cholesterol and mortality was investigated in 822 elderly hypertensive patients randomly assigned to treatment with diuretics, with or without methyldopa, or placebo. Cox's proportional hazards model showed that pretreatment serum total cholesterol levels were independently and inversely correlated with total mortality (p = 0.03), noncardiovascular mortality (p = 0.02), and cancer mortality (p = 0.04) during treatment. Total and noncardiovascular mortality were also negatively correlated with pretreatment hemoglobin levels and body weight. All factors being equal, an increase in total serum cholesterol of 2.3 mmol/L was associated with a one-year prolongation of survival. After adjustment for gender, age, pretreatment cardiovascular complications, and systolic pressure, the correlations between serum cholesterol and cardiovascular and cardiac mortality were not significant.

"Chiari pelvic osteotomy for osteoarthritis. The influence of the torn and detached acetabular labrum. We assessed the results of Chiari pelvic osteotomy in 64 hips with early osteoarthritis in terms of acetabular labral detachment detected pre-operatively by arthrography. At an average follow-up of four years, assessment by the Merle d'Aubigne score showed 83% excellent or good results. These satisfactory results were achieved in only half the cases with a detached labrum, but in nearly all cases with normal or torn acetabular labra. Other factors such as the acetabular index, the level and angle of osteotomy, and the displacement following osteotomy did not affect the results. Chiari pelvic osteotomy is a worthwhile procedure for early osteoarthritis in selected cases, but a detached acetabular labrum increases the risk of clinical failure. ",0
"Neurinoma in the cavernous sinus: report of two cases. Two cases of trigeminal neurinoma located solely in the cavernous sinus are reported. Preoperatively, magnetic resonance imaging provided the accurate localization of the lesions, allowing precise planning of the surgical approach, that is, a subtemporal lateral approach and a pterional superior approach, respectively. The neurinomas inside the cavernous sinus were removed successfully, and the patients developed no new neurological deficits except for anesthesia in the 1st division of the trigeminal nerve. The characteristic magnetic resonance imaging findings of trigeminal neurinoma in the cavernous sinus are presented, and the different surgical approaches are discussed. ",0
"Overt hepatic encephalopathy precipitated by zinc deficiency. Encephalopathy in liver disease may be unresponsive to protein restriction, lactulose, and neomycin. Zinc supplements have been reported to improve psychometric performance in liver cirrhosis, but the importance of zinc deficiency in overt hepatic encephalopathy has not yet been clearly established. A patient with severe recurrent hepatic encephalopathy was studied to determine the relation between her signs of encephalopathy and zinc deficiency. The study included a period in which zinc deficiency was artificially induced by oral histidine. An episode of overt encephalopathy occurred that was identical to earlier episodes and responded to oral zinc. The study showed an association between encephalopathy and zinc deficiency by successive zinc depletion and supplementation regimens. Long-term zinc supplementation improved severe recurrent hepatic encephalopathy and therefore the quality of life. ",0
"Standards for analysis of ventricular late potentials using high-resolution or signal-averaged electrocardiography: a statement by a task force committee of the European Society of Cardiology, the American Heart Association, and the American College of Cardiology. Sufficient data are available to recommend the use of the high-resolution or signal-averaged electrocardiogram in patients recovering from myocardial infarction without bundle branch block to help determine their risk for developing sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias. However, no data are available about the extent to which pharmacological or nonpharmacological interventions in patients with late potentials have an impact on the incidence of sudden cardiac death. Therefore, controlled, prospective studies are required before this issue can be resolved. As refinements in techniques evolve, it is anticipated that the clinical value of high-resolution or signal-averaged electrocardiography will continue to increase. ",0
"Angiocentric lymphoma with histologic features of neoplastic angioendotheliomatosis presenting with predominant respiratory and hematologic manifestations. Report of a case and review of the literature Neoplastic angioendotheliomatosis (NAE) is a rare fatal disease characterized by widespread intravascular proliferations of neoplastic mononuclear cells. Clinically, dermatologic and bizarre neurologic manifestations usually predominate. The origin of the neoplastic cells remains still undetermined. The authors report a patient with NAE peculiar with respect to the following points: (1) the patient predominantly manifested respiratory symptoms and hematologic findings and lacked cutaneous or neurologic manifestations; and (2) immunohistochemical and molecular genetic studies showed the B-cell nature of the neoplastic cells, although previous cases with predominant respiratory or hematologic manifestations were reported to be of endothelial origin. Despite the rarity, this type of NAE or angiocentric lymphoma should be recognized because it is easily confused with other disorders, particularly vasculitis or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

"A successful treatment of an intrarenal arteriovenous fistula by percutaneous embolization. A 37-year-old woman patient, known to have poorly controlled arterial hypertension that was diagnosed following a cerebrovascular accident at the age of 15 years, was referred to our outpatient clinic for investigation in 1987. An intrarenal arteriovenous fistula was diagnosed by selective renal angiography. Embolization of the fistula was performed using four 15-mm/5-cm coils, which induced thrombosis and obstructed the fistula. The vascularization of the affected kidney improved immediately. During the following 4 months, the antihypertensive treatment was stopped gradually, and the patient remained normotensive. This is an unusual case of a large intrarenal arteriovenous fistula, whose etiology was not clear, that was successfully treated by percutaneous embolization. ",0
"Lack of late skin necrosis in man after high-dose irradiation using small field sizes: experiences of grid therapy. Out of a total of 437 patients with superior vena caval syndrome or advanced malignancy, given single-dose grid radiotherapy, four survived to 7 years. The dose to the skin under each of the 77 holes in the grid was approximately 58 Gy. The lack of skin necrosis in the total of 308 skin circles of 1 cm diameter among these survivors, compared with known necrosis rates in larger irradiated areas, implies that there is a marked field-size effect for late necrosis in small areas of irradiated skin.

"Deteriorating ischemic stroke: risk factors and prognosis. To determine a risk profile of deterioration in cerebral infarction of less than 8 hours' duration, we studied prospectively a series of clinical and radiologic data in 98 patients. We evaluated the Canadian Neurological Scale Score and Barthel index during a follow-up period of 3 months. There was deterioration in the 1st 48 hours in 40.8% of the patients. High systolic blood pressure, elevated blood sugar concentration at admission, and carotid territory involvement were independently related with deterioration in the logistic regression analysis. Death occurred in 35% of the patients with deteriorating infarcts and in 8.6% of those with stable infarcts. At the end of the study, functional capacity was lower in those with deteriorating infarcts, but the 2 groups improved in parallel from the 4th day onward. ",0
"Peroneal nerve palsy after total knee arthroplasty. The prognosis for peroneal palsy after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is poorly defined. Twenty-six postoperative peroneal palsies occurred after 8998 TKAs performed between 1972 and 1985. Eighteen patients had complete and eight had incomplete peroneal palsies. Twenty-three had both motor and sensory deficits, and three had only motor deficits. At an average of 5.1 years (range, one to 11 years) after arthroplasty, recovery was complete for 13 palsies and partial for 12. Complete recovery was more likely in those palsies that were incomplete initially. Patients with palsies that were initially partial had significantly higher knee scores than those with complete palsies, and patients whose eventual recovery was complete had significantly higher knee scores than those with incomplete recovery. This new prognostic information should be useful for surgeons who encounter this unfortunate yet persistent complication of TKA. ",0
"Unknown primary squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to the neck. We analyzed retrospectively 157 cases of metastatic neck squamous cell carcinoma from unknown primary sites, treated with surgery, radiotherapy, excisional biopsy, and combined modalities. Median follow-up was 74 months, and overall actuarial survival was 55% at 5 years. The surgery-treated group, despite a higher rate of manifesting primary tumors, had significantly better survival at 5 years compared with those receiving radiation therapy, of whom 23% had residual disease after treatment. Primary tumors were discovered during follow-up in 16% overall. Different treatments yielded comparable results in lower-staged neck disease (NX, N1, N2a), while surgery appeared more effective in controlling advanced disease (N2b, N3a). Factors that affected survival include neck stage, connective tissue invasion, and presence of recurrent or residual disease after treatment. ",0
"Tissue changes around loose prostheses. A canine model to investigate the effects of an antiinflammatory agent. The aseptically loosened prosthesis provided a means for investigating the in vivo and in vitro activity of the cells associated with the loosening process in seven dogs. The cells were isolated and maintained in culture for sufficient periods of time so that their biologic activity could be studied as well as the effect of different agents added to the cells in vivo or in vitro. The biologic response as determined by interleukin-1 and prostaglandin E2 activity paralleled the roentgenographic appearance of loosening and the technetium images and observations made at the time of revision surgery. The correlation between clinical, roentgenographic, histologic, and biochemical loosening indicates that the canine model is suitable for investigating the mechanisms of prosthetic failure. A canine model permits the study of possible nonsurgical therapeutic interventions with the ultimate hope of stopping or slowing the loosening process. ",0
"Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia complicating multiple myeloma. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia complicated the course of two patients with multiple myeloma. The diagnosis was established in both cases by bronchoalveolar lavage, which demonstrated the typical pneumocysts. Clinical and roentgenographic improvement in both patients was observed following a course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. One patient had lymphocyte subsets performed with a CD4/CD8 ratio of 0.8; both patients were HIV antibody-negative by ELISA. Both patients tolerated prophylactic TMP-SMX given concurrently with the subsequent chemotherapy for myeloma. We suggest that the immune defect seen in multiple myeloma may have placed these patients at risk for opportunistic infections such as P carinii pneumonia; however, as opposed to patients with AIDS, our patients tolerated therapy with TMP-SMZ quite well.

"Movement disorders--limb movement and the basal ganglia. The primary concern of this article is to review experimental methods that may lead to a better understanding of the functional role of the basal ganglia in the control of movement. Two models of basal ganglia impairment are considered: Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. The review focuses primarily on akinesia and bradykinesia because they are key abnormalities of basal ganglia dysfunction. In general, through electromyography and kinematic analysis of movement, it may be possible to characterize specific movement disorders. Specifically, if damage sustained by the central nervous system is traced to a certain structure, it may provide insight on the extent of involvement and functional role of that structure in the control of movement. Much of the data reviewed suggests that the basal ganglia may play a specific role in the initiation and regulation of force control. ",0
"Prospective study of a prosthetic H-graft portacaval shunt. This study was undertaken to prospectively evaluate the 8-mm Gore-Tex interposition H-graft portacaval shunt. Thirty-six high-risk patients at the University of South Florida-affiliated hospitals received small-diameter shunts because of bleeding esophagogastric varices over a recent 2-year period. Portal vein and portal vein-inferior vena cava gradients were significantly reduced after shunting. These pressure changes were manifested clinically by the absence of variceal rebleeding and improvement of ascites; in addition, the incidence of encephalopathy was low. The 8-mm graft maintained hepatopedal flow in 67% of the patients, but reversal of flow did not result in complications commonly associated with poor portal perfusion. Graft thrombosis occurred in four (11%) patients. All grafts were successfully revised, three by operative revision and one by an interventional radiologist. Operative mortality was low (11%), and morbidity was unusual. The small-diameter H-graft portacaval shunt is a safe and effective method of treatment for bleeding esophagogastric varices. ",0
"Florid refractory schizophrenias that turn out to be treatable variants of HLA-associated narcolepsy. Narcolepsy in which the hallucinatory component is unusually prominent may lead to the development of an illness indistinguishable from the schizophrenic syndrome. Psychotic symptoms dominate the symptomatology, so that the primary illness is obscured. Five patients are described for whom conventional antipsychotic drugs were ineffectual, but for whom treatment with stimulants produced substantial improvement. The diagnosis of narcolepsy was confirmed by Human Leukocyte Antigen typing and sleep laboratory testing. These results support the ""REM intrusion"" hypothesis of the causation of schizophrenia in as many as 7% of a series of schizophrenic patients. Implications for diagnosis and treatment are discussed. ",0
"Small bowel enteroscopy: an early experience in gastrointestinal bleeding of unknown origin. Peroral small intestinal enteroscopy was performed in 35 consecutive patients with gastrointestinal bleeding of unknown origin by using a prototypic Sonde-type enteroscope. The median value for patient age was 69 years; duration of bleeding, 2 years (range, 2 months to 9 years); and transfusion requirements, 9 units. Bleeding was occult in 54% of these patients. Placement and passage of the enteroscope was performed by a gastrointestinal endoscopy assistant. Mean passage time was 4.3 hours. Complete passage was obtained in 14% of the patients, passage into the mid-distal ileum in 69%, and passage only into the jejunum in 17%. The diagnostic yield was 26%, with the majority of lesions encountered being mucosal vascular malformations. Small intestinal enteroscopy is a reasonable diagnostic procedure before embarking on visceral angiography and surgical exploration when standard endoscopic and radiologic methods fail to disclose a diagnosis.

Parathyroid hormone-like peptide in normal and neoplastic mesothelial cells. Mesothelioma has not been commonly reported as a cause of hypercalcemia of malignancy. We have studied a patient with malignant mesothelioma and hypercalcemia in association with elevated plasma concentrations of parathyroid hormone-like peptide (PLP). Immunohistochemical analysis of the tumor and seven of eight other mesotheliomas that were not associated with hypercalcemia revealed the presence of PLP cytoplasmic immunopositivity. PLP immunopositivity was also detected in normal and reactive mesothelial cells. The results of these studies suggest that PLP immunoreactivity is common in normal and neoplastic mesothelial cells and raises the possibility that PLP production may play a role in the pathogenesis of hypercalcemia associated with mesothelioma. ,0
Acute pulmonary oedema on the Ruwenzori mountain range. A 40 year old man had an episode of severe pulmonary oedema at 4000-5000 m during the ascent of the Margherita peak (5109 m) of Mount Stanley on the Ruwenzori. He had taken acetazolamide and high dose dexamethasone to treat symptoms of acute mountain sickness. Six years before he had been studied by right heart catheterisation as a healthy volunteer during hypoxic breathing at sea level. His pulmonary vascular reactivity had been within the normal range for 32 healthy subjects. This man had high altitude pulmonary oedema despite currently recommended treatments for acute mountain sickness and normal pulmonary vascular reactivity to hypoxia at sea level. ,0
"The modified superior based pharyngeal flap. Part III. A retrospective study. A retrospective study of 31 patients who had diagnosed velopharyngeal incompetence and were surgically managed with the modified superior based pharyngeal flap was completed. The following were analyzed: age at time of operation, gender, physical status, diagnostic protocol, length of operation (length of total surgery) and length of superior based pharyngeal flap, length of postoperative hospital stay, length of total hospital stay, length of follow-up, speech results, complications, patient care, and medication. The result showed that the optimal timing for correction of velopharyngeal incompetence was between 3 and 6 years of age. The mean length of total hospital stay was 2.7 days, postoperative complications were minimal, and speech results were generally good. ",0
"Duplex Doppler examination of a perinephric abscess in a renal transplant. Perinephric abscess has no characteristic ultrasonic appearance or location. Differentiation from urinoma, lymphocele, or hematoma depends on clinical and laboratory findings. Therapy consists of percutaneous catheter drainage, surgical drainage, and antibiotic therapy. Acute rejection is the most common cause of decreased diastolic flow during the immediate postoperative period. Acute tubular necrosis does not usually alter blood flow unless it is severe. Duplex doppler ultrasonic assessment of the renal transplant during the immediate postoperative period may provide a valuable baseline for comparison if complications develop. Baseline and follow-up ultrasonography to evaluate diastolic flow can help determine whether a posttransplant patient should receive emergency or conservative therapy for complications. ",0
"Obstructive sleep apnea presenting with nocturnal angina, heart failure, and near-miss sudden death. An obese woman with a one-year history of episodic nocturnal chest pain was admitted because of shock and pulmonary edema. A clinical diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock was made. She was ventilated and successfully resuscitated. Subsequent investigations showed no evidence of cardiac dysfunction or coronary disease, but sleep study confirmed the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). We suggest that the nocturnal angina and heart failure in this patient might have resulted from extreme hypoxemia produced by OSAS. This case raised the possibility that the high cardiovascular mortality rate reported in OSAS might not necessarily relate to underlying coronary artery disease. Further investigations are required to delineate the true incidence of coronary disease in patients with OSAS. ",0
"A prospective evaluation of the AO/ASIF universal femoral nail in the treatment of traumatic and reconstructive problems of the femur. Beginning in October 1986, we prospectively evaluated the AO/ASIF Universal Femoral Nail in the treatment of traumatic (89 nails) and reconstructive (11 nails) problems of the femur. For treatment of isolated femoral fractures, the mean time of patient positioning and nail insertion was 2.4 hours with a mean blood loss of 389 ml. Seventy-eight per cent of the patients were followed for a minimum of 12 months. There were no infections, one case of nail failure, two cases of screw fracture, and three nonunions. Sixteen nails have been uneventfully removed. The AO/ASIF femoral nail provides results comparable to other intramedullary interlocking devices. ",0
"N-[18F]fluoroacetyl-D-glucosamine: a potential agent for cancer diagnosis Positron labeled substrates such as sugars, amino acids, and nucleosides have been investigated for the in-vivo evaluation of biochemical processes in cancerous tissue. Hexosamines are obligatory structural components of many biologically important macromolecules, including membrane glycoproteins and mucopolysaccharide. We evaluated a new synthesized pharmaceutical, N-[18F]fluoroacetyl-D-glucosamine (18F-FAG), which is a structural analog of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. C3H/HeMsNRS mice bearing spontaneous hepatomas were used for the tissue distribution study. At 60 min after injection, high uptakes were found in tumor (5.16, mean value of %dose/g), liver (3.71), and kidney (3.27). The tumor uptake of 18F-FAG showed the highest value in all tissue. In the PET study, VX-2 carcinoma of the rabbit was clearly visualized. Our preliminary results suggest that 18F-FAG has potential as a new agent for tumor imaging. ",0
"src expression in small-cell lung carcinoma and other neuroendocrine malignancies. The proto-oncogene c-src codes for two tyrosine kinases, pp60c-src and pp60c-srcN. The latter protein appears to be exclusively expressed in neurons and neuronally differentiated tumors. In cell lines derived from neuroblastoma and small-cell lung carcinoma, src expression correlates positively with neuroendocrine differentiation. However, pp60c-srcN is expressed only in highly differentiated neuroblastomas. Although c-src expression in neuroendocrine tumors probably reflects and is the result of the differentiation stage at which the tumors have been arrested, high c-src expression and kinase activities in non-neuroectodermal tumors, e.g., colon carcinoma, breast carcinoma, might instead be a part of the malignant phenotype and contribute to the development of these tumors.

"Isolated lipase and colipase deficiency in two brothers. Two brothers of Arab origin, aged 15 and 10 years, with isolated congenital lipase and colipase deficiency are described. Both were normally developed with a history of passing greasy stools since early infancy. Both have remarkable steatorrhoea and low serum carotene and vitamin E concentrations. After exocrine pancreatic stimulation, lipase and colipase activities in the duodenal fluid were almost completely absent, while amylase trypsin, bile salt, and pH values were normal. No other aetiology for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency was found. This is the first report of congenital combined lipase and colipase deficiency in two brothers. ",0
"Carpal tunnel syndrome: correlations between pressure measurement and intraoperative electrophysiological nerve study. In 19 carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) patients and 4 control subjects a catheter was introduced into the carpal tunnel and slowly retracted in 5 mm steps. Pressure was measured with the continuous infusion technique. In the same group of patients and controls, median nerve antidromic sensory action potential (aSAP) was detected intraoperatively stimulating proximally (S1), in the center (S2), and distally (S3) to the carpal tunnel and recording from the third finger (R). Sensory conduction velocity (SCV) and aSAP amplitude were considered in S1-S2, S2-S3 and S3-R segments. The intracarpal tunnel pressure was significantly higher in CTS patients than in controls, with the highest values located between 25 and 35 mm distal to the proximal border of the flexor retinaculum. SCV and aSAP amplitude were also decreased most often in the distal part (S2-S3) of the carpal tunnel. ",0
"Transtelephonic defibrillation. STUDY OBJECTIVES: This study was undertaken to assess the safety and reliability of a device for transtelephonic defibrillation. DESIGN: The transtelephonic system consists of a patient unit and a base station. The patient unit contains a monitor-defibrillator, electrode pads, microphone, microprocessor, and DC defibrillator. The base station comprises a control panel, computer, and ECG display. SETTING: Fifteen patients who were treated in our emergency department for cardiac arrest were placed on patient units that activated our base station in a remote location within the ED. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Thirteen patients were treated for ventricular fibrillation, and two patients were treated for ventricular tachycardia. INTERVENTIONS: Thirty-one shocks were delivered transtelephonically. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In all cases, voice and ECG transmission were established without difficulty. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that this system represents a safe and reliable method for the treatment of ventricular fibrillation, and we advocate additional use to study the prehospital applications of transtelephonic defibrillation.

"Diffuse hemangiomatosis of the spleen: splenic hemangiomatosis presenting with giant splenomegaly, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. In an elderly patient with oligosymptomatic giant splenomegaly, clinical and laboratory data were nondiagnostic, while nonhomogeneous splenic enlargement was the only finding detected by imaging procedures. Splenectomy was performed and diffuse hemangiomatosis of predominantly capillary-type found. The failure of imaging techniques to even hint at the nature of the underlying disorder is comprehensible in view of the organ being essentially replaced in toto by the abnormal vascular channels. Diffuse splenic hemangiomatosis, a rare condition, may cause hypersplenism, and its diagnosis may be elusive because of misleading patterns on imaging. ",0
"Characterization of the in vitro maturation of monocytes and the susceptibility to HIV infection. The in vitro maturation of peripheral blood monocytes to macrophages can be followed morphologically, and by measurement of cell surface antigens (CD4, HLA-DR, and FcR III) and lysozyme production. We used these markers to correlate monocyte maturation with susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Maturation of peripheral blood monocytes is associated with a decrease in membrane CD4, while HLA-DR and FcR III expression increase along with lysozyme secretion. Cells at all stages of maturation were susceptible to HIV infection, even mature macrophages without CD4 detectably by immunofluorescent staining. Maximal replication was observed in 7-day-old cells.

"Increasing asthma prevalence in a rural New Zealand adolescent population: 1975-89. A survey of asthma symptoms and spirometry in 435 adolescent schoolchildren was undertaken in 1989 in a rural, largely Maori population. The survey questionnaires were identical to those used in a 1975 survey at the same school. The prevalence of reported asthma or wheeze significantly increased from 26.2% to 34.0%. This increase occurred in groups reporting asthma, and also those reporting wheeze unassociated with colds, but without a previous diagnosis of asthma. There was a tendency for a rise in reported wheeze in Europeans (24.3% to 27.4%) and a significant rise in Maoris (27.1% to 36.2%). The reclassification of other respiratory problems did not account for the increase. Data from this study provides evidence that there has been a rise in the prevalence of asthma in this New Zealand population over a time period of 14 years. ",0
"Brain magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychologic evaluation of patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. We compared brain magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychologic performance in 20 neurologically asymptomatic patients suffering from idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (mean age 41 [range 18-49] years) and 20 age-matched controls (mean age 38 [range 28-49] years). Patients exhibited a significantly higher rate of cerebral infarcts (20% versus 0%, p less than 0.05) and cortical (50% versus 5%, p less than 0.01) and ventricular (55% versus 15%, p less than 0.02) atrophy than controls. Accordingly, semiquantitative volumetric measurements yielded a significantly increased ventricular-to-intracranial cavity ratio in the patients (6.2 +/- 2.9% versus 4.1 +/- 1.3%, p less than 0.01). This ratio and the cortical atrophy ratings correlated positively with disease duration (r = 0.63 and 0.54, p less than 0.05). Cognitive test performance was significantly worse in patients than in controls and was most impaired in those patients with morphologic cerebral abnormalities. ",0
"Unusual lymphoproliferative oropharyngeal lesions in heart and heart-lung transplant recipients. Three unusual cases of oropharyngeal lympho-proliferative lesions were seen in recipients of heart and heart-lung transplants. Two caused acute upper respiratory obstruction necessitating urgent ENT intervention. All patients were receiving immunosuppressive drugs including cyclosporin. The two obstructive cases were adenotonsillar enlargement in a 6-year-old, and a tumour of the tonsil and tongue base with cervical lymph node enlargement in a 32-year-old male. Both were caused by Epstein-Barr Virus-associated lymphoproliferative disorder. The third patient, a 32-year-old female, had a presumed low grade T-cell lymphoma that regressed spontaneously. Histopathological diagnosis of these lympho-proliferative disorders after transplantation usually requires immunocytochemistry to distinguish polyclonal proliferative disorders from true lymphoma. Polyclonal lymphoproliferative disorders after transplantation do not usually require aggressive cytoreductive therapy, but respond to simple measures such as the reduction of immunosuppression. ",0
"Permanent external striated sphincter stents in patients with spinal injuries. Nine patients with complete quadriplegia underwent external striated sphincter stenting with the Wallstent in place of an external striated sphincterotomy. Although suprapubic catheters were placed to provide an outlet should problems develop with the stent, they were successfully removed within 6 weeks in all but 1 patient. Complete bladder emptying with reduced voiding pressures was achieved, together with a significant reduction in the duration of hyper-reflexic contractions. Epithelialisation of the stent was almost complete within 3 months and intermittent catheterisation or endoscopy (and resection) is possible through the stent. Although this is a preliminary report of this new technique, it is hoped that sphincter stenting will provide a rapid, safe and effective method of treating high pressure hyper-reflexia and detrusor sphincter dyssynergia in quadriplegic patients.

"Hyponatraemia in patients with cirrhosis. Hyponatraemia occurs in nearly half of patients in hospital with cirrhosis and ascites, and is due to the excessive retention of free water which results from the kidney's inability to excrete it normally. The morbidity and mortality associated with hyponatraemia is largely attributable to central nervous system disturbances. The degree to which brain water content increases depends on the duration of hyponatraemia and on compensatory mechanisms. Altered steroid and peptide hormones in cirrhotic patients may contribute to the development of hyponatraemic encephalopathy, symptoms of which overlap with hepatic encephalopathy and uraemia. The occurrence of central pontine myelinolysis is unrelated to the rate of correction of hyponatraemia. The appearance of hyponatraemia in cirrhotic patients, long regarded as a poor prognostic sign, may be a function of unrecognized underlying impaired renal function. Therapy for hyponatraemia remains suboptimal. ",0
Colonoscopy during an attack of severe ulcerative colitis is a safe procedure and of great value in clinical decision making. Thirty-four patients who had severe ulcerative colitis had a colonoscopic examination during the attack. The indications were resistance to therapy and/or differential diagnostic purposes. Total colonoscopy was performed in 25 cases and less extensive examination in nine. Biopsy was taken in 22 cases. No clinically significant complications occurred. The procedure helped us to postpone immediate surgical intervention in 19 cases. Fourteen of these patients have maintenance treatment and are still well after a follow-up median time of 5 yr (6 months to 10 yr). ,0
"Transitional cell carcinoma of the upper urinary tract: prognostic variables and post-operative recurrences. In a retrospective study of 198 patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the upper urinary tract, post-operative recurrences developed as contralateral tumours in 2.5%, in the ureteric stump after conservative resection in 19% and in the bladder in 36.4%. Upper tract recurrences resembled the primary tumours in terms of grade and stage; of the bladder tumours, 89% were similar in grade and 72% similar in stage to the primary tumours. Age, sex, grade and stage had no effect on the number of bladder recurrences, but ureteric tumours had significantly more recurrences than renal pelvicaliceal tumours. Sex, bladder recurrences and site of primary tumours did not influence survival. Thus grade and stage of the primary tumour were the only predictive variables of the final outcome. ",0
"In vivo leukocyte migration in arthritis. We quantitated in vivo migration of neutrophils into the knees of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis, using 99mtechnetium-hexamethyl-propylene-amineoxime-labeled leukocytes and gamma scintigraphy. Significant neutrophil migration occurred in patients with RA irrespective of disease duration, and it was reduced by 60% following intraarticular steroid injection. The reduction in neutrophil migration correlated with reduction in pain. Leukocyte migration into osteoarthritic joints was also demonstrated, although it was much less than that seen in rheumatoid joints. No significant leukocyte migration into the joints of patients without arthritis was demonstrated. This technique appears to provide a sensitive method for quantitatively assessing the neutrophil component of inflammation in individual joints of patients with arthritis. ",0
"Paediatric urolithiasis in Greece. A group of 44 patients, aged from 10 months to 14 years, underwent surgery for urinary calculi over a 7-year period (1982-1989). Eleven patients had bilateral or multiple calculi (total number of stones = 55, 20 of which were staghorn). Metabolic disorders (n = 25) and Proteus urinary infection (n = 15) were the 2 factors most often associated with lithiasis. Of the 55 stones, 51 were removed by open surgery. Complete stone clearance was achieved in 29 of 36 kidneys. Follow-up periods in the remaining 7 renal units (with small residual fragments) ranged from 3.5 to 7.5 years (mean 6.2) and revealed stone recurrence in only 2 patients. Evaluation of childhood urolithiasis should include thorough metabolic investigation and sound surgical judgment; effective management requires prolonged post-operative follow-up. ",0
Unusual haemostasis for an unusual tumour. Catastrophic bleeding from a tactile neurofibroma affecting the thoracic vertebrae. Case report. The symptomatology of a typical acute descending thoracic aorta dissection was imitated by profuse haemorrhage caused by a benign tumour composed almost exclusively of Wagner-Meissner like tactile corpuscles and fatty tissue. The tumour caused extensive destruction of the bodies of the fifth and sixth thoracic vertebrae at the level of the vertebro-costal articulation. Emergency cross clamping of the descending aorta and haemostasis of the bleeding from osteal defects by tamponade with bone polymethyl methacrylate appeared the only way to control the life threatening haemorrhage. It seems that an intrathoracic tactile neurofibroma with a similar case history has not been reported till now. ,0
"The management of the painful first metatarsophalangeal joint in the older patient. Arthrodesis or Keller's arthroplasty? We report a prospective randomised trial comparing Keller's arthroplasty and arthrodesis of the first metatarsophalangeal joint for the management of symptomatic hallux valgus and hallux rigidus in the older patient. In 81 patients (110 feet), with a minimum of two years follow-up, both procedures gave a similar degree of patient satisfaction and symptom relief. The incidence of metatarsalgia was also similar. As there were no obvious advantages to arthrodesis, and since six out of 50 arthrodesed toes required revision, we suggest that Keller's arthroplasty is the better operation in these patients. ",0
"Management of soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities. The management of soft tissue sarcomas has undergone and continues to undergo important changes. The purpose of this report is to review the presentation, diagnosis, and natural history of soft tissue sarcomas. In so doing, the importance of a careful and rigorous method of evaluation will be emphasized. Furthermore, the results of multidisciplinary treatment, with a goal towards limb salvage, will be reviewed. With appropriate and timely intervention, selected patients with pulmonary metastases may still experience long-term survival. Throughout this review, the importance of early and continuing multidisciplinary treatment and evaluation will be emphasized. ",0
"A randomized trial of the effect of three non-steroid anti-inflammatory agents in ameliorating cancer-induced fever. Paraneoplastic fever is well known, and is not an uncommon problem in daily practice. In an effort to ameliorate tumour-induced fever we randomized 48 patients to receive three different non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs: Naproxen (500 mg d-1), Indomethacin (75 mg d-1) or Diclophenac sodium (75 mg d-1). All patients had solid tumours, and microbial infection had been excluded. All three drugs were equally effective in bringing the temperature down to normal for a period of 30-33 d. Naproxen had the most rapid effect. In cases of fever relapse with the first drug, when the other two drugs were given instead, both proved equally effective. No side-effects were observed. We conclude that Naproxen, Indomethacin and Diclophenac sodium are equally effective in ameliorating paraneoplastic fever. In relapse, a second drug given subsequently can be effective as well. ",0
"Reproducibility of growth hormone testing procedures: a comparison between 24-hour integrated concentration and pharmacological stimulation. The purpose of this study was to compare the reproducibility of two approaches to the evaluation of GH secretion: the integrated concentration of GH (IC-GH), a physiological test of GH secretion, and pharmacological stimulation tests. IC-GH was determined in 40 poorly growing children twice within 4 weeks. The first and second IC-GH were highly correlated r = 0.859, P less than 0.001. One hundred and thirteen poorly growing children underwent pharmacological GH stimulation tests twice within 6 weeks. A moderate correlation was found between the first and second pharmacological test r = 0.524, P less than 0.01. Among the three pharmacological stimuli studied, clonidine (n = 81) had the highest reproducibility followed by arginine (n = 20), and insulin (n = 12). We conclude that IC-GH is more consistently reproducible than the GH response to repeated pharmacological stimulation. ",0
"Hemibody irradiation in advanced prostatic carcinoma. In summary, hemibody irradiation has developed as a safe, efficient technique for palliating multiple sites of symptomatic osseous metastases, which occur so often in advanced prostatic carcinoma. The rapidity, frequency, and duration of pain relief, as well as the convenience to the patient of a solitary treatment to multiple symptomatic areas simultaneously, make this type of treatment especially appealing. By following premedication and radiation dose guidelines, both acute and delayed side effects can be kept tolerable or at a minimal incidence. Although sequential hemibody radiation has also been explored as ""systemic"" therapy, the results in prostatic carcinoma have not proved dramatic, and complications have been considerable. Hormonal therapy would certainly seem to be less life-threatening and equally beneficial according to present data. As a palliative treatment, however, hemibody irradiation is a pragmatic option for relieving prostatic cancer pain. ",0
"Giant benign mesenchymoma of the breast. The term mesenchymoma refers to a group of mixed tumors that are composed of two or more mesenchymal elements, excluding fibrous tissue, not ordinarily found together within the same tumor. Mesenchymomas occur most commonly in the renal and perirenal regions with rare occurrence in the breast. We describe what to our knowledge is the first report of a giant benign mesenchymoma of the breast. The clinical presentation, course, and treatment of a patient with this condition is discussed. Clinicians should be aware that benign mesenchymomas may involve the breast and simulate a malignant breast neoplasm. ",0
"Hepatic infarction in preeclampsia. Two cases of hepatic infarction in toxemia of pregnancy are described. Both patients had associated laboratory findings of the HELLP syndrome (hemolytic anemia, elevated liver enzyme levels, and low platelet levels). Computed tomography (CT) showed nonenhancing low-attenuation areas varying in configuration from peripheral, well-defined, wedge-shaped lesions to larger abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a corresponding area of low signal intensity on T1-weighted images with high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. Ultrasound showed several well-defined peripheral hypoechoic areas. The low attenuation and lack of enhancement on CT scans and the absence of mass effect are the key distinguishing features. ",0
"Translocation (9;22) is associated with extremely poor prognosis in intensively treated children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The prognostic implications of t(9;22)(q34;q11) were assessed at a median follow-up of 3.5 years in 434 children receiving intensive treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Four-year event-free and overall survivals were 81% and 88%, respectively, in 419 children lacking t(9;22), but were 0% and 20%, respectively, in 15 children with t(9;22) (P less than .001). Poor outcome for children with t(9;22)-positive ALL was particularly notable because we have reported improved survival in other historically poor prognosis ALL cytogenetic categories when treated with similarly intensive therapy. We recommend that very intensive treatment approaches, including bone marrow transplantation in first remission, be considered for all children with t(9;22)-positive ALL. ",0
"Endoscopic placement of a Foley catheter across a stricture and rectovaginal fistula to perform a barium enema. Evaluation of enteric fistulas is often best performed with barium contrast studies. Clinical situations that preclude the satisfactory installation of barium decrease the yield of the study. A case is presented of a 59-yr-old female with stage III-B cervical carcinoma and a known rectovaginal fistula with an adjacent sigmoid colon stricture. An additional more proximal, enteric fistula was suspected. Definitive preoperative knowledge of the existence or absence of this fistula would have shortened the duration of a planned palliative intervention. The rectovaginal fistula and stricture precluded adequate barium and air installation for contrast study. Colonoscopy was unsuccessful. We have developed a combined technique in which the endoscopic placement of a semirigid guidewire allowed placement of a Foley catheter across the fistula and stricture. Successful barium study was performed. Intraoperative time and hospital stay were shortened. ",0
"The risk of large bowel cancer after partial gastrectomy for benign ulcer disease. The relative risk (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] for colorectal cancer after partial gastrectomy for ulcer disease was examined in a population-based cohort comprising 6459 patients operated during 1950 to 1958. Follow-up through 1983 revealed 131 cases of colorectal cancer versus 150.3 expected cases (SIR = 0.87; 95% confidence limits 0.73, 1.03). The relative risk was decreased during the first 19 years of follow-up (SIR = 0.75; 0.58, 0.96) and close to equal thereafter (SIR = 1.02; 0.79, 1.29). Sex, age at operation, type of operation, and diagnosis at operation (stomach or duodenal ulcer) did not affect the relative risk significantly. Confounding by socioeconomic status is one conceivable explanation for the decreased relative risk during the first years of follow-up, whereas the increasing risk with longer duration of follow-up might be a consequence of the surgical procedure itself.

"Amyloidosis of the small intestine: findings on double-contrast radiographs. The appearance of the small intestinal mucosa on double-contrast barium examinations was studied in 26 patients with proved intestinal amyloidosis. Findings included innumerable fine granular densities 1-3 mm in diameter (16 patients), multiple nodular densities 3-4 mm in diameter (four patients), multiple polypoid protrusions 4-10 mm in diameter (three patients), irregularities of Kerckring folds (12 patients), and multiple erosions (eight patients). The multiple nodular densities and erosions disappeared after the patients were treated with total parenteral nutrition. The other abnormalities remained unchanged on follow-up examinations. Our results indicate that double-contrast radiographic findings of the small intestine in patients with amyloidosis include mucosal abnormalities that vary according to the pathologic type of amyloid deposition.

"Hemolytic transfusion reaction following transfusion of frozen and washed autologous red cells A case of hemolytic transfusion reaction, accompanied by hypotension and followed by transient renal failure, occurred after the transfusion of 1 unit of previously frozen autologous red cells. Subsequent investigation revealed the probable cause of the hemolysis to be inadequate deglycerolization of the unit. The cause of the associated symptoms is unknown. Possibilities include nephrotoxic effects of hemoglobin or stroma, toxic effects of glycerol, or release of vasoactive or thrombogenic substances from lysed red cells. This case of a hemolytic reaction adds to the known risks of autologous transfusion. ",0
"Multimodality cisplatin treatment in nonresectable alpha-fetoprotein-positive hepatoma.  Twenty-eight patients with alpha-fetoprotein-positive (AFP+) nonresectable hepatoma have been enrolled in a new multimodality Phase I, II program. The program consists of cisplatin-based chemotherapy, followed by locoregional therapies including transarterial chemoembolization and radiofrequency ablation. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this treatment approach. The patients had a mean age of 55 years and a median AFP level of 1500 ng/mL. The majority had advanced stage disease, with vascular invasion observed in 75% of cases. The initial cisplatin-based chemotherapy resulted in a partial response in 50% of patients and stable disease in 35%. Subsequently, locoregional therapies were performed, with an overall response rate of 64%. The median overall survival was 18 months. Adverse events were mostly manageable and included nausea, vomiting, and hematological toxicities. This multimodality treatment approach shows promising results in AFP+ nonresectable hepatoma patients and warrants further investigation in larger clinical trials.",1
"Quantification of leakage pressures after durotomy repairs in the canine. Part III. A laboratory study. A laboratory study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of various durotomy repairs in preventing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage in canines. Twelve adult canines underwent a standardized durotomy procedure, followed by repair with different techniques: suture alone, fibrin sealant, and a combination of both. Leakage pressures were quantified using a pressure transducer system. The results showed that the combination technique had the highest mean leakage pressure, followed by fibrin sealant alone, and suture alone had the lowest mean leakage pressure. The difference in leakage pressures between the techniques was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the combination technique resulted in the lowest occurrence of postoperative CSF leakage, while the suture alone technique had the highest occurrence. These findings suggest that the combination technique of using both sutures and fibrin sealant is the most effective method for preventing CSF leakage after durotomy repair in canines.",1
"Risk of cancer death in first-degree relatives of patients with hereditary non-polyposis cancer syndrome (Lynch type II): a study of 130 kindreds in the United Kingdom. This study aimed to assess the risk of cancer death in first-degree relatives of patients with hereditary non-polyposis cancer syndrome (HNPCC), also known as Lynch syndrome type II, in the United Kingdom. A total of 130 kindreds were included in the study, and data on cancer deaths in first-degree relatives were collected through nationwide registers. The results showed a significantly increased risk of cancer death in first-degree relatives compared to the general population. The most common types of cancer associated with HNPCC in relatives were colorectal, endometrial, and gastric cancers. The risk of cancer death was highest in relatives younger than 50 years old. These findings highlight the importance of heightened surveillance and screening for cancer in the first-degree relatives of patients with HNPCC to facilitate early detection and improve outcomes.",1
"Obesity and colorectal adenomatous polyps.  Obesity has been investigated as a risk factor for various malignancies, including colon cancer. This study aimed to assess the association between obesity and the presence of colorectal adenomatous polyps, which are considered precursors to colorectal cancer. A total of 500 patients who underwent colonoscopy for various indications were included in this retrospective analysis. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated for each patient and categorized according to standard classifications. The presence of adenomatous polyps was determined based on histopathological examination of the biopsy specimens obtained during colonoscopy. The results showed a significant positive correlation between obesity, as measured by BMI, and the presence of adenomatous polyps. Furthermore, this association remained significant even after adjusting for potential confounding factors such as age, gender, smoking status, and family history of colorectal cancer. These findings suggest that obesity may serve as a modifiable risk factor for the development of colorectal adenomatous polyps and emphasize the importance of weight management in the prevention of colorectal cancer.",1
"Relatively enhanced S cone function in the Goldmann-Favre syndrome. Goldmann-Favre syndrome is a rare inherited retinal degenerative disorder characterized by night blindness, peripheral visual field loss, and atypical electroretinograms (ERGs). This study aimed to investigate the functional abnormalities associated with the syndrome, particularly the S cone function. Eight patients with Goldmann-Favre syndrome underwent full-field electroretinography (ERG) and psychophysical testing including color vision testing and static perimetry.

The results revealed a relative enhancement of S cone function in all patients. The photopic ERG responses demonstrated increased S cone sensitivity compared to the normal range, indicating hyperfunction of the S cones in Goldmann-Favre syndrome. Color vision testing further confirmed the presence of enhanced S cone function, as patients showed increased sensitivity to short-wavelength stimuli.

Static perimetry revealed diffuse visual field loss predominantly in the mid-peripheral and peripheral regions. The extent of field loss correlated with the severity of ERG abnormalities, suggesting an association between S cone hyperfunction and progressive peripheral visual field loss in Goldmann-Favre syndrome.

In conclusion, this study provides evidence of relative enhanced S cone function in Goldmann-Favre syndrome, which may contribute to the characteristic clinical features of the disease. Further investigations are warranted to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets for this rare retinal disorder.",1
"Incidence of myocarditis.  A 10-year autopsy study from Malmo, Sweden. We conducted a comprehensive autopsy study over a 10-year period in Malmo, Sweden, to determine the incidence of myocarditis. A total of 348 autopsies were included, with a mean age of 61 years (range 12-97 years). Myocarditis was identified in 62 cases, resulting in an incidence of 17.8%. The majority of cases (66%) were male, and the mean age of myocarditis patients was 57 years. The most common histological finding in myocarditis cases was lymphocytic infiltrates (77%), followed by interstitial fibrosis (56%) and myocyte necrosis (44%). Viral genome was detected in 27% of cases, with enterovirus being the most frequently identified virus (68%). Myocarditis-related mortality accounted for 12% of all autopsied deaths. Our findings emphasize the importance of considering myocarditis as a potential cause of sudden cardiac death and highlight the need for further research in this field.",1
"New approaches to the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of cytomegalovirus infection after transplantation. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in transplant recipients. This abstract aims to review the current approaches to the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of CMV infection after transplantation. 

Diagnosis of CMV infection is primarily based on the detection of viral DNA in blood samples using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays. However, recent advances in molecular diagnostics have allowed for the development of novel methods, such as next-generation sequencing and droplet digital PCR, which offer higher sensitivity and specificity.

Prevention of CMV infection relies on prophylactic antiviral therapy with agents such as ganciclovir or valganciclovir. However, the emergence of drug-resistant strains and the potential for adverse effects necessitate careful monitoring and individualized treatment plans.

Treatment of CMV infection involves antiviral therapy to control viral replication and prevent disease progression. Novel therapies, including letermovir and CMV-specific T-cell immunotherapy, have shown promising results in clinical trials.

In conclusion, the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of CMV infection after transplantation continue to evolve. Advances in molecular diagnostics and the development of novel antiviral therapies offer new opportunities to improve patient outcomes.",1
"Pancreatic ascites presenting in infancy, with review of the literature. Pancreatic ascites is a rare condition that occurs mainly in adults, with very few reported cases in infants. We present a case of pancreatic ascites in a 6-month-old infant and review the literature on this condition. The infant presented with severe abdominal distension, vomiting, and failure to thrive. Abdominal imaging revealed a large amount of ascitic fluid, and subsequent investigations confirmed the presence of pancreatic ascites. Treatment involved drainage of the ascitic fluid and initiation of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. The literature review revealed a total of 17 reported cases of pancreatic ascites in infants, with variable clinical presentations and outcomes. Early diagnosis and initiation of appropriate treatment are crucial for optimizing outcomes in these patients. Further research is needed to better understand the pathogenesis and optimal management of pancreatic ascites in infants.",1
"Epstein-Barr virus associated oesophageal ulcers in AIDS. Oesophageal ulcers are a common manifestation in patients with AIDS, often caused by opportunistic infections. This study aimed to investigate the association between Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and oesophageal ulcers in AIDS patients. A total of 75 AIDS patients with oesophageal ulcers were included in the study. Tissue biopsy samples were collected and analyzed for the presence of EBV using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemical staining. EBV was detected in 52 out of 75 (69.3%) biopsy samples. Patients with EBV-positive ulcers had a significantly higher CD4 cell count compared to those with EBV-negative ulcers (p<0.05). Our findings suggest an association between EBV and oesophageal ulcers in AIDS patients, highlighting the importance of viral screening in the management of these ulcers.",1
"Endoscopic ultrasonography in diagnosis of the extent of gallbladder carcinoma.  Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) was performed preoperatively in 39 patients with gallbladder carcinoma.  Diagnosis of the anatomical extent of gallbladder carcinoma was compared with histologic analysis, and staging accuracy was evaluated according to the TNM classification. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) has been widely used as a diagnostic tool in the assessment of gallbladder carcinoma. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the accuracy of EUS in determining the anatomical extent of gallbladder carcinoma compared to histologic analysis. A total of 39 patients with gallbladder carcinoma underwent preoperative EUS, followed by surgical resection and histopathological examination. The findings from EUS were compared with the histologic analysis, and the staging accuracy was assessed according to the TNM classification. The results demonstrated a high concordance between EUS and histologic analysis in determining the extent of gallbladder carcinoma, with an overall accuracy rate of 85%. EUS proved to be a valuable tool in guiding the management and treatment decisions for patients with gallbladder carcinoma, providing crucial information for surgical planning and prognosis assessment.",1
"Combined vesicovaginal-ureterovaginal fistulas associated with a vaginal foreign body. We present a unique case of combined vesicovaginal-ureterovaginal fistulas in a 42-year-old woman with a history of inserting a foreign body into her vagina. She presented with recurrent urinary tract infections, vaginal discharge, and leakage of urine through the vagina. Physical examination revealed a vaginal foreign body with purulent discharge and erythema. Imaging studies confirmed the presence of combined fistulas involving the bladder, ureter, and vagina. The foreign body was removed under general anesthesia, followed by repair of the fistulas using a transvaginal approach. The patient experienced complete resolution of her symptoms postoperatively. Combined vesicovaginal-ureterovaginal fistulas associated with a vaginal foreign body are extremely rare, and prompt diagnosis and surgical intervention are crucial to prevent further complications and improve patient outcomes.",1
"Lipolytic factors associated with murine and human cancer cachexia. Cachexia is a prevalent and debilitating condition characterized by severe weight loss and muscle wasting in patients with cancer. Lipolysis, the breakdown of lipids, is believed to play a crucial role in the development of cancer cachexia. However, the specific lipolytic factors involved in this process remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the association between lipolytic factors and cancer cachexia in both murine and human models. Using a murine model of colon cancer cachexia, we identified elevated levels of the lipolytic enzyme hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) in adipose tissue. Furthermore, we found that HSL expression was positively correlated with markers of cachexia severity. In a cohort of cancer patients, we observed similar findings, with increased levels of HSL in adipose tissue from cachexia patients compared to non-cachexia controls. These results suggest that lipolytic factors, particularly HSL, may contribute to the development and progression of cancer cachexia. Further research is warranted to explore the potential therapeutic targeting of these lipolytic pathways in the management of cachexia.",1
"The reliability of palpation in the assessment of tumours. Palpation is a commonly used technique in the clinical setting to assess the presence and characteristics of tumors. However, there is limited evidence on the reliability of palpation as a diagnostic tool for tumors. This study aimed to evaluate the reliability of palpation in the assessment of tumors.

A total of 100 patients with suspected tumors were included in the study. Two experienced clinicians independently palpated the patients' lesions and recorded their findings. These findings were compared with the gold standard, which was the histopathological diagnosis obtained through biopsy or surgery.

The results showed that the sensitivity of palpation in detecting tumors was 78%, with a specificity of 65%. The positive predictive value was 73%, while the negative predictive value was 70%. The overall accuracy of palpation in diagnosing tumors was 71%.

Furthermore, the inter-observer agreement between the two clinicians in their palpation findings was moderate, with a kappa value of 0.56. This indicates that there is a fair degree of agreement between the clinicians but also suggests some variability in their palpation assessments.

In conclusion, palpation appears to have moderate reliability in the assessment of tumors. While it can provide useful information in detecting tumors, its limitations in terms of sensitivity and specificity should be taken into consideration. Additional diagnostic techniques, such as imaging and biopsy, should be considered to complement and confirm the findings of palpation.",1
"Tuberculosis of the esophagus.  Tuberculosis of the esophagus is rare. Tuberculosis (TB) of the esophagus is an uncommon manifestation of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics, diagnostic approach, and treatment outcomes of patients diagnosed with tuberculosis of the esophagus. A total of 32 patients with confirmed tuberculosis of the esophagus were identified over a period of 10 years. The most common symptoms included dysphagia (87.5%), weight loss (78.1%), and chest pain (59.4%). Endoscopy revealed various manifestations, including ulcers, strictures, and nodules. Diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological examination or positive acid-fast bacilli staining from biopsy specimens in all cases. Combination anti-tuberculosis therapy was administered to all patients, and surgical intervention was required in 6 cases with complicated disease. The overall treatment success rate was 87.5%. In conclusion, tuberculosis of the esophagus is a rare but potentially severe condition. Early diagnosis, prompt initiation of anti-tuberculosis treatment, and appropriate surgical intervention, when necessary, are essential for successful management of this disease.",1
"Enhanced antitumor reactivity of tumor-sensitized T cells by interferon alfa. Interferon alfa (IFN-α) has been widely used as an immunotherapy agent in various malignancies due to its potent antitumor effects. In this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of IFN-α on the antitumor reactivity of tumor-sensitized T cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from patients with solid tumors who had received autologous tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic cell vaccination. Tumor-sensitized T cells were activated ex vivo in the presence or absence of IFN-α. Our results demonstrated that the addition of IFN-α significantly enhanced the proliferation and cytotoxicity of tumor-sensitized T cells compared to controls. Moreover, IFN-α treatment resulted in a significant increase in the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-2 and interferon-γ. Mechanistically, IFN-α upregulated the expression of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules on tumor cells, facilitating the recognition and killing of tumor cells by activated T cells. These findings suggest that IFN-α can enhance the antitumor reactivity of tumor-sensitized T cells, highlighting its potential as an adjunct therapy in cancer immunotherapy.",1
"Multiple intracranial mucoceles associated with phaeohyphomycosis of the paranasal sinuses. We report a rare case of multiple intracranial mucoceles associated with phaeohyphomycosis of the paranasal sinuses. A 54-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus and chronic sinusitis presented with recurrent headaches and progressive visual disturbances. Imaging studies revealed multiple well-defined cystic lesions in the frontal and ethmoid sinuses, extending into the intracranial cavity. Surgical excision of the lesions was performed, and histopathological examination confirmed the presence of phaeohyphomycosis. The patient was treated with antifungal therapy, and his symptoms gradually improved. Phaeohyphomycosis is a rare fungal infection caused by dematiaceous fungi. It typically presents as chronic sinusitis or cutaneous infections, but intracranial involvement is extremely rare. The association of phaeohyphomycosis with intracranial mucoceles has not been extensively reported in the literature. Our case highlights the importance of considering phaeohyphomycosis as a differential diagnosis in patients with chronic sinusitis, especially in those with predisposing factors such as diabetes mellitus. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate management are essential to prevent complications such as intracranial mucoceles.",1
"Rett syndrome: findings suggesting axonopathy and mitochondrial abnormalities. Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by severe cognitive and physical impairments, predominantly affecting females. Recent studies have suggested that there may be underlying axonopathy and mitochondrial abnormalities in individuals with Rett syndrome. 

Axonopathy, characterized by abnormal structural development and function of axons, has been hypothesized as a potential mechanism contributing to the neurological deficits observed in Rett syndrome. Studies utilizing advanced imaging techniques, such as diffusion tensor imaging, have provided evidence of disrupted white matter microstructure in affected individuals, supporting the presence of axonopathy. Furthermore, postmortem studies have revealed abnormal axonal morphology and reduced myelination in various brain regions.

Mitochondrial dysfunction has also been implicated in the pathophysiology of Rett syndrome. Studies have reported alterations in mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activities and reduced ATP production in individuals with the condition. Additionally, abnormalities in mitochondrial DNA integrity and oxidative stress markers have been observed.

Further research is needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which axonopathy and mitochondrial abnormalities contribute to the phenotypic manifestations of Rett syndrome. Understanding these underlying pathologies may help in the development of targeted therapeutic interventions for this devastating condition.",1
"Indications and results of relaxing retinotomy. Relaxing retinotomy is a surgical procedure used to treat various vitreoretinal disorders, including proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) and retinal detachment, that are refractory to standard treatments. This retrospective study aims to evaluate the indications and outcomes of relaxing retinotomy in a cohort of patients. A total of 35 eyes from 32 patients who underwent relaxing retinotomy between 2010 and 2020 were included in the analysis. The main indications for the procedure were PVR (n=21), tractional retinal detachment (n=10), and combined tractional-rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (n=4). The surgical technique involved creating a retinal break in the area of maximal traction to release the retinal forces. Anatomic success, defined as retinal reattachment, was achieved in 28 eyes (80%). Visual acuity improved or remained stable in 27 eyes (77%). Complications included intraoperative hemorrhage (n=2), postoperative retinal detachment (n=3), and epiretinal membrane formation (n=5). In conclusion, relaxing retinotomy is an effective surgical option for PVR and complex retinal detachments, with favorable anatomical and visual outcomes in our cohort.",1
"Temporal movement control in patients with Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor symptoms, including bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor. Temporal movement control is a critical aspect of motor function that is often impaired in these patients. This study aimed to investigate the specific deficits in timing and synchronization of movements in individuals with Parkinson's disease. The researchers conducted tests on a cohort of Parkinson's patients and a control group, assessing their ability to time movements accurately and synchronize with external cues. Results showed that Parkinson's patients exhibited significant difficulties in both aspects compared to controls. Furthermore, the severity of these deficits correlated with disease progression and motor impairment. These findings suggest that temporal movement control is a specific impairment associated with Parkinson's disease. Understanding the underlying mechanisms and developing interventions to improve timing and synchronization skills may have important implications for rehabilitation strategies and the overall quality of life for individuals with Parkinson's disease. Further research is warranted to elucidate the neurological basis of these deficits and develop targeted interventions to address them effectively.",1
"Risk factors for white matter changes detected by magnetic resonance imaging in the elderly. White matter changes (WMC) seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are common in the elderly and have been associated with cognitive decline and increased risk of stroke. This study aimed to identify risk factors for WMC in the elderly population. A total of 200 participants aged 60 years or older underwent MRI brain scans and comprehensive assessments of medical history and lifestyle factors. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, and obesity were independent risk factors for the presence and severity of WMC. These findings highlight the importance of targeting these modifiable risk factors to prevent or delay the development of WMC and subsequent cognitive decline in the elderly.",1
"Inflammatory breast cancer.  Historically, the prognosis of inflammatory breast cancer has been poor. Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare and aggressive form of breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognosis and outcomes of patients with IBC. The medical records of 100 patients diagnosed with IBC between 2000 to 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. The majority of patients presented with advanced stage disease and exhibited poor overall survival rates. The median overall survival was found to be 2.5 years, with a five-year survival rate of only 25%. Multivariate analysis showed that age, tumor size, lymph node involvement, and hormone receptor status were significant prognostic factors for survival in patients with IBC. These findings highlight the need for early detection and aggressive treatment strategies for IBC patients. Further research is warranted to identify novel effective therapies for this aggressive form of breast cancer.",1
"The effect of enoximone and dobutamine on hemodynamic performance after open heart surgery.  A clinical comparison. In patients undergoing open heart surgery, the use of inotropic agents is crucial for optimizing hemodynamic performance. Enoximone and dobutamine are two commonly used drugs in this context; however, their comparative effectiveness remains uncertain. 

This study aimed to assess and compare the hemodynamic effects of enoximone and dobutamine in patients after open heart surgery. A total of 100 patients were randomized into two groups: one receiving enoximone and the other receiving dobutamine. Hemodynamic parameters including mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, pulmonary artery pressure, and systemic vascular resistance were measured at baseline and at different time points postoperatively.

The results showed that both enoximone and dobutamine significantly improved hemodynamic performance compared to baseline values. However, there were no significant differences in the measured parameters between the two treatment groups. Adverse events were minimal and comparable between the two groups.

In conclusion, both enoximone and dobutamine are effective in improving hemodynamic performance after open heart surgery. The choice between these two agents can be based on other factors such as cost and availability. Further research is warranted to determine any long-term differences in outcomes between the two drugs.",1
"Cytologic criteria to distinguish hepatocellular carcinoma from nonneoplastic liver.  The authors reviewed a series of fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) specimens of the liver to identify useful cytologic criteria to distinguish hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from nonneoplastic liver. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a challenging diagnosis to make on cytology, especially on fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) specimens of the liver. In this study, the authors aimed to identify cytologic criteria that can aid in distinguishing HCC from nonneoplastic liver. The authors reviewed a series of FNAB specimens from patients with known HCC and nonneoplastic liver conditions. Several cytologic criteria were identified that showed promise in distinguishing HCC from nonneoplastic liver, including nuclear enlargement, pleomorphism, hyperchromasia, and increased nucleocytoplasmic ratio. Additionally, the presence of multinucleated giant cells and keratin pearl-like structures were found to be highly indicative of HCC. These findings suggest that specific cytologic features can aid in the accurate diagnosis of HCC on FNAB, potentially leading to improved patient management and treatment outcomes.",1
"The accuracy of predictions about progress of patients on a stroke unit. This study aimed to assess the accuracy of predictions made by healthcare professionals regarding the progress of patients on a stroke unit. A total of 100 patients admitted to the stroke unit were included in the study. Predictions regarding the patients' progress were made by a team of healthcare professionals, comprising physicians and nurses, at various time points during their hospital stay. The predictions were compared to the actual progress of the patients as measured by standardized outcome measures, including functional ability, cognitive function, and mortality rates.

Results showed that the overall accuracy of predictions made by the healthcare professionals was moderate. The accuracy varied depending on the specific outcome measure being predicted. Predictions regarding mortality rates had the highest accuracy, followed by functional ability and cognitive function. Factors such as age, initial stroke severity, and comorbidities were found to influence the accuracy of predictions.

"Toxicities in rats with free versus liposomal encapsulated cisplatin. Cisplatin is a widely used chemotherapy drug for the treatment of various malignancies. However, it is associated with dose-dependent nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. Liposomal encapsulation of cisplatin is a novel approach that aims to reduce its systemic toxicities by altering its pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. In this study, we compared the toxicities of free cisplatin and liposomal encapsulated cisplatin in rats. Rats were divided into two groups and received either free cisplatin or liposomal encapsulated cisplatin at equimolar doses. Evaluation of nephrotoxicity was done by measuring serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels, as well as by histopathological examination of kidney tissues. Ototoxicity was assessed by measuring auditory brainstem response thresholds. Our results showed that liposomal encapsulated cisplatin significantly reduced nephrotoxicity compared to free cisplatin, as evidenced by lower serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels, as well as less severe histopathological changes in kidney tissues. Similarly, liposomal encapsulation of cisplatin resulted in a significant reduction in ototoxicity compared to free cisplatin, as indicated by higher auditory brainstem response thresholds. These findings suggest that liposomal encapsulation of cisplatin may be a promising strategy to mitigate its systemic toxicities, thereby improving its therapeutic index.",1

"A controlled trial of psychological treatment for the irritable bowel syndrome. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of psychological treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) through a controlled trial. Forty-eight patients diagnosed with IBS were randomly assigned to either a treatment group or a control group. The treatment group received a comprehensive psychological treatment program consisting of psychoeducation, stress management techniques, and cognitive-behavioral therapy, while the control group received standard medical management alone.

The results showed that the psychological treatment significantly reduced the severity and frequency of IBS symptoms compared to the control group. Additionally, patients in the treatment group experienced improved quality of life and reduced levels of anxiety and depression. The treatment effects were sustained at a three-month follow-up assessment.

These findings suggest that psychological interventions can be effective in reducing symptoms and improving overall well-being in patients with IBS. They highlight the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to managing IBS, integrating psychological treatments alongside medical management for optimal outcomes. Further research is needed to determine the long-term efficacy and cost-effectiveness of psychological interventions in the management of IBS.",1

These findings highlight the importance of managing modifiable risk factors to reduce the burden of WMC in the elderly population.",1
"Radiologic staging of chest in testicular seminoma. Testicular seminoma is one of the most common testicular tumors in young males. Although it has a highly curable prognosis, the management and staging of this malignancy remain important. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the utility of radiologic staging of the chest in testicular seminoma. We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 150 patients diagnosed with testicular seminoma between 2005 and 2020. Chest imaging, including computed tomography scans and chest X-rays, were performed for all patients. We found that chest imaging identified chest metastases in 23 patients (15.3%). Among these, 18 patients had isolated lung metastases, while 5 patients had concurrent lung and mediastinal lymph node involvement. Our results suggest that routine chest imaging is crucial in the staging and management of testicular seminoma, as it can detect early chest metastases and guide treatment decisions.",1
"Autosomal recessive chronic granulomatous disease caused by deletion at a dinucleotide repeat. Autosomal recessive chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by a defect in the NADPH oxidase enzyme complex, leading to impaired generation of reactive oxygen species by phagocytes. The genetic basis of CGD has been extensively studied, with mutations in CYBB, NCF1, NCF2, and NCF4 genes being the most common causes. In this study, we report a unique case of autosomal recessive CGD caused by a deletion at a dinucleotide repeat in the CYBB gene. The patient presented with recurrent severe infections and granulomatous inflammation involving various organs. Immunological investigations revealed a defect in oxidative burst activity in neutrophils and monocytes. Genetic analysis identified a homozygous deletion at the (GT)n repeat site in exon 6 of the CYBB gene. This deletion resulted in a frame-shift mutation in the CYBB mRNA, leading to a premature termination codon. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a dinucleotide repeat deletion causing autosomal recessive CGD. Further functional studies are warranted to elucidate the precise molecular mechanism underlying this unique genetic defect and its impact on NADPH oxidase activity.",1
"Treatment of chronic moccasin-type tinea pedis with terbinafine: a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Chronic moccasin-type tinea pedis is a common fungal infection characterized by a dry, scaly, and hyperkeratotic lesion on the plantar aspect of the foot. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of terbinafine in the treatment of this condition. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 100 patients with chronic moccasin-type tinea pedis were randomized to receive either terbinafine 250 mg daily or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure was complete clinical cure, defined as absence of scaling, redness, and pruritus at the end of treatment. Secondary outcomes included mycological cure and adverse events. The results showed that terbinafine was significantly more effective than placebo in achieving complete clinical cure (p < 0.001). Mycological cure rates were also superior in the terbinafine group (p = 0.003). Adverse events were minimal and comparable between the two groups. In conclusion, terbinafine is a safe and effective treatment option for chronic moccasin-type tinea pedis.",1
"Gentamicin iontophoresis in the treatment of bacterial otitis externa in the guinea pig model.  Pseudomonas otitis externa is one of the most common infections treated by otolaryngologists. Bacterial otitis externa is a common infection in otolaryngology practice, with Pseudomonas species being a frequent causative agent. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of gentamicin iontophoresis in the treatment of Pseudomonas otitis externa using the guinea pig model. A total of 24 guinea pigs were divided into three groups: control group, gentamicin iontophoresis group, and gentamicin topical application group. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was inoculated into the external ear canals of all animals to induce otitis externa. The animals in the gentamicin iontophoresis group received gentamicin solution via iontophoresis, while those in the topical application group received topical gentamicin drops. The control group received no treatment. Clinical and histopathological evaluations were performed at the end of the study. The results showed that gentamicin iontophoresis was more effective in reducing inflammation, eradicating bacterial infection, and promoting epithelialization compared to topical application. Therefore, gentamicin iontophoresis could be considered as a potential treatment option for bacterial otitis externa caused by Pseudomonas species.",1

"Major histocompatibility complex antigen expression in the affected tissues in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  Monoclonal antibody immunocytochemistry was used to examine spinal cord and muscle in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis for changes that would indicate ongoing or potential immune activity. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the selective degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain. Although the etiology of ALS remains largely unknown, there is increasing evidence suggesting a potential role of immune dysregulation in the pathogenesis of the disease. In this study, we investigated the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens, which play a crucial role in immune responses, in affected tissues of ALS patients. Monoclonal antibody immunocytochemistry was performed on spinal cord and muscle specimens obtained from ALS patients. Our results showed increased expression of MHC antigens in both spinal cord and muscle tissues, indicating ongoing immune activity in these regions. Moreover, the degree of MHC antigen expression correlated with the severity of motor neuron loss, suggesting a potential link between immune activation and neuronal degeneration. These findings provide further insights into the underlying mechanisms of ALS and suggest potential therapeutic targets for the modulation of immune responses in this devastating disease.",1
"Natural history of moderate aortic stenosis.  The natural history of severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis has been well documented. However, limited information is available regarding the natural history of moderate aortic stenosis. This study aimed to investigate the long-term prognosis and progression of moderate aortic stenosis in a cohort of patients. 

A total of 112 patients with moderate aortic stenosis were included in the study. Baseline characteristics, including age, gender, and comorbidities, were recorded. Echocardiographic parameters, such as aortic valve area, peak and mean transvalvular gradients, and left ventricular function, were also assessed. 

Follow-up was conducted for a mean duration of 5 years, during which clinical events were monitored. The primary endpoint of the study was a composite of cardiac death, need for aortic valve replacement, or development of severe aortic stenosis. 

Results showed that 37% of patients reached the primary endpoint during the follow-up period. The annual incidence rate of reaching the primary endpoint was 8.2%. Older age, female gender, and the presence of comorbidities were identified as risk factors for adverse outcomes. 

In conclusion, moderate aortic stenosis is associated with a significant risk of adverse clinical events. These findings highlight the importance of close monitoring and timely intervention in patients with moderate aortic stenosis to prevent disease progression and improve patient outcomes.",1
"The effect of omental pedicle graft transfer on spinal microcirculation and laminectomy membrane formation.  The properties of the omentum and its effect on spinal neurologic disease was investigated. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of omental pedicle graft transfer on spinal microcirculation and laminectomy membrane formation. Twenty-five patients with spinal neurologic disease underwent laminectomy and were divided into two groups: the omental graft group and the control group. The omental graft group received omental pedicle graft transfer during laminectomy, while the control group did not. Microcirculation in the spinal cord was assessed using laser Doppler flowmetry, and laminectomy membrane formation was evaluated using histological analysis. Results showed that omental graft transfer significantly improved spinal microcirculation and inhibited laminectomy membrane formation. These findings suggest that omental pedicle graft transfer may be a promising technique to enhance spinal neurologic recovery and prevent complications following laminectomy.",1

"Surgical results of intrathoracic gastric volvulus complicating hiatal hernia.  From 1981 to 1988, 138 patients with hiatal hernia were treated surgically at our centre. Hiatal hernia is a common condition characterized by the protrusion of the stomach through the diaphragmatic hiatus. Gastric volvulus, a potentially life-threatening complication, occurs when the stomach twists upon itself, leading to compromised blood supply and potential strangulation. In this study, we present the surgical outcomes of 138 patients with hiatal hernia, including those with gastric volvulus.

From 1981 to 1988, all patients underwent surgical intervention at our center. The surgical approach involved reduction of the herniated stomach, repair of the diaphragmatic defect, and, in cases of gastric volvulus, correction of the twist. Concurrent fundoplication was performed in patients with significant gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Of the 138 patients, 17 presented with gastric volvulus. Among these, 14 underwent emergent surgery due to acute symptoms, while the remaining three had chronic volvulus managed electively. Intraoperative findings revealed various degrees of gastric torsion, with Type III volvulus being the most common (n=9).

Overall, surgical intervention proved successful in all cases, with complete resolution of symptoms and no major postoperative complications. This study highlights the importance of early recognition and surgical management of gastric volvulus in patients with hiatal hernia.",1
"Obesity and vaginal hysterectomy. Obesity is a well-established risk factor for various surgical complications. However, its impact on vaginal hysterectomy outcomes remains unclear. In this retrospective study, we aimed to evaluate the association between obesity and perioperative complications in women undergoing vaginal hysterectomy. We included 300 women who underwent vaginal hysterectomy between 2015 and 2020. They were categorized into two groups based on their body mass index (BMI): non-obese (BMI < 30 kg/m^2) and obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m^2). We found that obese women had a significantly higher incidence of perioperative complications, including surgical site infection, wound dehiscence, and urinary tract infection, compared to non-obese women. These findings emphasize the importance of careful consideration and management of obese patients undergoing vaginal hysterectomy to reduce postoperative complications.",1
"Experience with the use of coronary autoperfusion catheter during complicated angioplasty.

This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the experiences with the use of coronary autoperfusion catheter in 45 patients undergoing complicated angioplasty. The study included patients who had total occlusions, severe calcifications, or angioplasty in high-risk locations. The results showed that the use of coronary autoperfusion catheter was associated with improved angiographic outcomes in 82% of patients and no major adverse events were reported. Overall, the study demonstrates the potential benefits of coronary autoperfusion catheter in complicated angioplasty procedures and provides valuable insights for its use in clinical practice.",1
"The role of intracaval filters in patients with COPD and DVT. In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), the use of intracaval filters is controversial. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 50 patients with COPD and DVT who underwent placement of an intracaval filter. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intracaval filters in this specific patient population. Our results showed that the use of intracaval filters was associated with a high rate of filter-related complications, including filter migration, fracture, and thrombus formation. Additionally, there was no significant difference in the incidence of recurrent DVT or pulmonary embolism between patients who received an intracaval filter and those who did not. These findings suggest that the routine use of intracaval filters in patients with COPD and DVT may not be justified and should be carefully considered on a case-by-case basis. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these results.",1
"Differential memory and executive functions in demented patients with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Dementia is a common and debilitating feature of Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aimed to compare differential memory and executive functions in demented patients with PD and AD. Twenty-five patients with PD dementia (PDD), 25 patients with AD, and 25 healthy controls were included in the study. Participants underwent comprehensive neuropsychological assessments measuring memory and executive functions. Results showed that both PDD and AD groups performed significantly worse than healthy controls across all memory and executive function tests. Furthermore, the PDD group performed significantly worse than the AD group in tests assessing executive functions. These findings suggest that PDD and AD exhibit distinct profiles of cognitive impairment, with executive dysfunction being more prominent in PDD. Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms contributing to these differences.",1
"Intradural spinal cord tumor presenting as a subarachnoid hemorrhage: magnetic resonance imaging diagnosis. Intradural spinal cord tumors are a rare entity and are usually asymptomatic. We present a case of a 55-year-old male who presented with sudden onset severe neck pain radiating to the lower back, associated with headache, vomiting, and altered consciousness. Initial computed tomography scan of the head was unremarkable. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine showed a subarachnoid hemorrhage extending from the cervical to the lumbar levels, associated with an intradural tumor in the cervical region. The tumor displayed heterogeneous enhancement on post-contrast imaging. A diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary to an intradural spinal cord tumor was made. The patient underwent surgical resection of the tumor and made a good recovery, with resolution of symptoms and no recurrent bleeding on follow-up MRI. This case highlights the importance of considering intradural spinal cord tumors as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with subarachnoid hemorrhage, and the utility of MRI in diagnosing such lesions.",1
"Essential hypertension, metabolic disorders, and insulin resistance. Essential hypertension is a common medical condition characterized by chronic elevation of blood pressure without an identifiable cause. Metabolic disorders, including obesity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance, have been associated with an increased risk of developing essential hypertension. Insulin resistance, a key feature of metabolic syndrome, is characterized by reduced insulin sensitivity and impaired glucose metabolism. It is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension through various mechanisms, including endothelial dysfunction, increased sympathetic activity, and sodium retention. This abstract aimed to review the current literature on the relationship between metabolic disorders, insulin resistance, and essential hypertension. Studies have consistently shown that individuals with metabolic disorders and insulin resistance are at an increased risk of developing hypertension. Managing insulin resistance through lifestyle modifications, such as weight reduction, physical activity, and dietary interventions, may have beneficial effects on blood pressure control. Further research is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms and potential targeted therapies for this complex relationship.",1
"Hyponatraemia in patients with cirrhosis. Hyponatraemia is a common electrolyte disturbance in patients with cirrhosis and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This retrospective study aims to evaluate the prevalence and risk factors for hyponatraemia in patients with cirrhosis. Medical records of 256 cirrhotic patients admitted to a tertiary hospital over a two-year period were reviewed. The prevalence of hyponatraemia was found to be 38.3%. Multivariate analysis revealed ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and serum albumin levels as independent risk factors for hyponatraemia. The mortality rate was significantly higher in patients with hyponatraemia compared to those without (17.5% vs. 6.4%). Moreover, patients with hyponatraemia had longer hospital stays and increased rates of complications. These findings highlight the importance of monitoring serum sodium levels in cirrhotic patients, especially those with ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, or low serum albumin levels. Early identification and management of hyponatraemia may improve outcomes in this patient population.",1

Itraconazole is a widely used antifungal medication for the treatment of aspergillosis; however, there is limited data on its efficacy and safety in a large patient population. In this study, we evaluated the use of itraconazole in 49 patients with aspergillosis. The patients were treated with itraconazole for a median duration of 12 weeks. The overall response rate to itraconazole therapy was 71%, with 14 patients achieving complete response and 22 patients achieving partial response. The median time to response was 4 weeks. Adverse events were reported in 32% of patients, with the most common being gastrointestinal disturbances. Liver function abnormalities were observed in 6% of patients but were reversible upon discontinuation of the drug. These findings suggest that itraconazole therapy is effective and well-tolerated in the treatment of aspergillosis.",1
"Ethyl chloride and venepuncture pain: a comparison with intradermal lidocaine. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of ethyl chloride and intradermal lidocaine in reducing venepuncture pain. A total of 100 adult participants undergoing venepuncture were randomly allocated to receive either ethyl chloride spray or intradermal lidocaine injection prior to the procedure. Pain scores were assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) immediately after the venepuncture. The mean pain score for the ethyl chloride group was 3.8 (SD=1.2), while the mean pain score for the lidocaine group was 2.4 (SD=0.9). The difference in pain scores between the two groups was statistically significant (p<0.001), with lidocaine providing more effective pain relief compared to ethyl chloride. These findings suggest that intradermal lidocaine is a more reliable method for reducing venepuncture pain compared to ethyl chloride spray.",1
"Expression of major histocompatibility complex class II antigens and interleukin-1 by epithelial cells of Warthin's tumor. Warthin's tumor is a benign neoplasm of the salivary gland which is characterized by lymphoid infiltrates. The exact etiology and pathogenesis of this tumor remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens and interleukin-1 (IL-1) by the epithelial cells of Warthin's tumor. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed strong positive staining for MHC class II antigens and IL-1 in the epithelial cells of Warthin's tumor. These findings suggest that the epithelial cells of Warthin's tumor have the ability to present antigens to T lymphocytes and produce IL-1, which may play a role in the immune response associated with this neoplasm. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the specific mechanisms underlying this immune response and its implications in the pathogenesis of Warthin's tumor.",1
"Modified technique of Pringle's maneuver in resection of the liver. In liver resection surgeries, the Pringle's maneuver is commonly employed to control bleeding. However, this maneuver carries a risk of ischemic injury to the liver. This study presents a modified technique of the Pringle's maneuver, aiming to decrease liver morbidity and improve postoperative outcomes. Seventy-five patients undergoing liver resection were included in the study, with half assigned to the modified technique group and the other half to the traditional technique group. The modified technique involved intermittent clamping of the hepatoduodenal ligament instead of continuous clamping. Results showed that the modified technique significantly reduced liver ischemic injury, postoperative liver dysfunction, and overall morbidity compared to the traditional technique. This modified technique may offer a safer approach to liver resections.",1
"The treatment of chondrodermatitis nodularis with cartilage removal alone.  Fifty-eight patients with chondrodermatitis nodularis on the antihelix in 24 ears (16 women and eight men) and the helix in 40 ears (six women and 34 men) were studied. Chondrodermatitis nodularis is a benign inflammatory condition affecting the cartilage of the ear. The traditional treatment approach involves excision of the affected cartilage along with closure techniques, which can be challenging and time-consuming. In this study, we evaluate the outcomes of a modified approach using cartilage removal alone without closure techniques. Fifty-eight patients with chondrodermatitis nodularis on the antihelix in 24 ears and the helix in 40 ears were included. The patients underwent cartilage removal under local anesthesia. Follow-up evaluations were performed at regular intervals, ranging from 6 months to 2 years. Seventy-one percent of the patients showed complete resolution of symptoms without any recurrence. The cosmetic outcomes were satisfactory, with minimal scarring. This modified approach using cartilage removal alone offers a simpler and effective treatment option for chondrodermatitis nodularis, eliminating the need for complex closure techniques.",1

Dermatologists and pediatricians should be aware of the potential cutaneous manifestations of Shwachman syndrome to ensure early diagnosis and appropriate management.",1
"Ostium secundum atrial septal defect in the elderly. The incidence and clinical outcome of ostium secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) in elderly patients is not well characterized. We conducted a retrospective study to determine the clinical features, management, and prognosis of elderly patients (age >65 years) with ostium secundum ASD. Data from a total of 78 patients were analyzed, with a median age of 71 years. The majority of patients presented with symptoms such as dyspnea and fatigue. Echocardiography confirmed the diagnosis of ASD in all patients. Percutaneous transcatheter closure was the preferred treatment approach, resulting in successful closure in 90% of cases. The overall mortality rate during the follow-up period was 6.4%, primarily due to unrelated comorbidities. Our findings suggest that ostium secundum ASD can be effectively managed in the elderly population using percutaneous transcatheter closure.",1
"Gastrointestinal bleeding in a 15 month old male. Gastrointestinal bleeding is a rare occurrence in children, especially in infants. We present a case of a 15-month-old male who presented with recurrent episodes of melena and generalized weakness. Initial laboratory investigations showed a hemoglobin level of 7.2 g/dL and evidence of acute blood loss. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed multiple gastric erosions and duodenal ulcers with active bleeding. The patient was managed with intravenous proton pump inhibitors and blood transfusions to stabilize his condition. Further evaluation revealed a rare underlying cause of gastrointestinal bleeding, juvenile polyposis syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by the presence of numerous hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to episodes of bleeding. The patient underwent surgical intervention to remove the polyps and was initiated on long-term surveillance to prevent future complications. This case underscores the importance of considering less common etiologies in pediatric gastrointestinal bleeding and highlights the need for prompt diagnosis and appropriate management in order to optimize patient outcomes.",1
"Fulminating multiple sclerosis-like leukoencephalopathy revealing human immunodeficiency virus infection.  A 66-year-old French homosexual man and a 42-year-old Brazilian man with no known risk factors for HIV infection developed headaches, asthenia, and neurologic episodes of abrupt onset. Both patients were initially diagnosed with fulminant multiple sclerosis- like leukoencephalopathy based on clinical presentation, magnetic resonance imaging findings, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis. However, subsequent testing revealed underlying human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in both cases. The progression of neurological symptoms in these patients, along with the presence of characteristic white matter lesions on imaging, raised suspicions of an atypical presentation of HIV-associated neurologic disease. This case report highlights the importance of considering HIV infection in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with acute neurological symptoms and radiological evidence of leukoencephalopathy, even in the absence of known risk factors for HIV. Early recognition and appropriate management of HIV-related neurologic complications are crucial for optimal patient outcomes.",1
"Small cell carcinoma of the pancreas and biliary tract. Small cell carcinoma (SCC) is a rare and aggressive neoplasm most commonly associated with the lung. However, SCC can also arise in extrapulmonary sites, including the pancreas and biliary tract. We present a case series of 8 patients diagnosed with SCC of the pancreas or biliary tract, highlighting their clinical features, treatment strategies, and outcomes. The majority of patients presented with advanced disease, characterized by locally advanced tumors or distant metastasis. The diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological examination, which showed small-sized cells with scant cytoplasm, hyperchromatic nuclei, and frequent mitotic figures. Treatment included a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, although the overall prognosis remained poor. Recognition of SCC in the pancreas and biliary tract is crucial for appropriate management and potentially improving patient outcomes. Further research is needed to better understand the etiology, molecular characteristics, and optimal therapeutic approaches for this rare subtype of cancer.",1
"Esophageal reflux before and after isolated myotomy for achalasia.  Four patients with achalasia underwent 24-hour esophageal pH measurements as ambulatory patients before and after limited myotomy without fundoplication.  Resting lower esophageal sphincter pressure was reduced from 24. 3 +/- 1. 2.3 to 11.1 +/- 0.9 mm Hg after the myotomy. The duration of acid reflux was significantly increased postoperatively compared to preoperatively (4.8 +/- 2.2% vs. 0.9 +/- 0.5%, p < 0.05), while the percent time with pH < 4 showed no significant change (0.7 +/- 0.3% vs. 0.4 +/- 0.2%, p > 0.05). Two patients developed symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux postoperatively, requiring anti-reflux medication. These findings suggest that while limited myotomy for achalasia reduces resting lower esophageal sphincter pressure, it may also increase the duration of acid reflux. These results highlight the importance of postoperative monitoring and potential need for adjunct anti-reflux measures in achalasia patients undergoing myotomy without fundoplication.",1
"Iatrogenic saphenous neuralgia: successful therapy with neuroma resection. Iatrogenic saphenous neuralgia is a rare complication that can occur following surgical procedures involving the saphenous nerve. We report a case of iatrogenic saphenous neuralgia in a 42-year-old male, who presented with severe pain, numbness, and hypersensitivity along the distribution of the saphenous nerve following an orthopedic surgery. Initial conservative management with medications and physical therapy provided temporary relief, but the patient's symptoms persisted. Surgical exploration revealed the presence of a painful neuroma involving the saphenous nerve. The neuroma was excised, and the symptoms completely resolved postoperatively. This case highlights the importance of considering iatrogenic saphenous neuralgia as a potential complication following surgical procedures involving the saphenous nerve. Our successful outcome with neuroma resection suggests that surgical management should be considered in patients with persistent symptoms despite conservative treatment. Further research is needed to optimize the management of this condition.",1
"Late juvenile-onset Krabbe's disease. Late juvenile-onset Krabbe's disease is a rare neurological disorder caused by deficiency of the enzyme galactocerebrosidase and characterized by progressive loss of myelin in the nervous system. Typically, it presents in infancy or early childhood; however, a small subset of patients may develop symptoms in late childhood or adolescence. We report the case of a 13-year-old male who presented with gait disturbances, muscle weakness, and cognitive decline. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed diffuse white matter abnormalities consistent with leukodystrophy. Genetic testing confirmed the diagnosis of late juvenile-onset Krabbe's disease.

"Evaluation of treatment protocols on minimal to moderate spasticity in multiple sclerosis. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of various treatment protocols on minimal to moderate spasticity in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). A total of 120 MS patients with spasticity were randomly assigned to receive one of three treatment protocols: physical therapy, oral medications, or a combination of both. The primary outcome measure was the change in spasticity severity, assessed using the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment.

Results showed that all treatment protocols resulted in significant improvements in spasticity severity compared to baseline. However, the combination therapy group demonstrated the greatest reduction in MAS scores, followed by the oral medication group and the physical therapy group. In addition, the combination therapy group also had significant improvements in functional outcomes, such as mobility and quality of life.

Overall, these findings suggest that a combination of physical therapy and oral medications may be the most effective approach for managing minimal to moderate spasticity in MS patients. Further research is needed to evaluate long-term effects and compare different treatment combinations to optimize spasticity management in this population.",1

"Social environment and social support. Social environment and social support play critical roles in stroke rehabilitation and recovery, particularly among older adults. This abstract highlights the importance of understanding the geropsychological perspective in stroke rehabilitation, emphasizing the impact of social factors on patient outcomes. 

Research has shown that social support has a direct influence on functional improvement and overall quality of life for geriatric stroke patients. The presence of a supportive and nurturing social network can enhance recovery and provide emotional and practical assistance. Additionally, social relationships can serve as a buffer against the negative effects of depression and anxiety, common psychological comorbidities following stroke. 

However, challenges related to social isolation, limited social resources, and changes in familial dynamics can impede rehabilitation progress in elderly stroke patients. Interventions targeting the social environment, such as group therapy, community programs, and caregiver education, have shown promise in facilitating recovery and improving outcomes. 

To enhance stroke rehabilitation for geriatric patients, further research is needed to explore the specific mechanisms through which social factors influence recovery.

"Concurrence of malignant hyperthermia and congenital abnormalities. Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a rare but potentially fatal condition characterized by hypermetabolism and skeletal muscle rigidity in response to certain triggering agents, such as volatile anesthetics and depolarizing muscle relaxants. Here, we present a case of a 2-week-old male infant with congenital abnormalities who experienced an MH episode during his first surgery. The patient exhibited hyperthermia, tachycardia, metabolic acidosis, and elevated creatine kinase levels. Genetic testing revealed a pathogenic variant in the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RYR1) gene, confirming the diagnosis of MH susceptibility. Additionally, the infant had multiple congenital anomalies including a cleft lip and palate, clubfoot, and polydactyly. This case highlights the importance of recognizing the association between MH and congenital abnormalities, as the presence of anomalies may serve as a clue to underlying susceptibility to MH. An interdisciplinary approach involving genetic counseling, anesthesia, and surgical teams is crucial for the safe management of these patients.",1
"Pharmacologic treatment of noncognitive behavioral disturbances in elderly demented patients. Noncognitive behavioral disturbances, such as agitation, aggression, and psychosis, commonly occur in elderly demented patients and pose substantial challenges in their management. Pharmacologic treatment is often considered in such cases, but selecting the appropriate medications can be complex. This abstract aims to discuss the pharmacologic treatment options for noncognitive behavioral disturbances in elderly demented patients. Antipsychotic medications, particularly second-generation agents, are commonly used and have shown efficacy in managing aggression and psychosis. However, their use is associated with the risk of adverse effects, including increased mortality and stroke. Other medications, such as antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and anxiolytics, are also utilized in specific situations. The decision to initiate pharmacologic treatment should be individualized, considering the severity and impact of the symptoms, potential risks and benefits, and the patient's overall health and prognosis. Nonpharmacologic approaches, including psychological interventions and environmental modifications, should also be considered as part of a comprehensive management plan. Further research is needed to optimize the pharmacologic treatment of noncognitive behavioral disturbances in this population.",1
"Metastatic carcinoma of the gallbladder from renal cancer presenting as intraluminal polypoid mass. A case of metastatic carcinoma of the gallbladder from renal cancer presenting as an intraluminal polypoid mass is reported. A 65-year-old female presented with intermittent abdominal pain and was found to have a polypoid lesion in the gallbladder on imaging. Surgical intervention was performed, and histopathological examination confirmed the presence of metastatic renal cancer within the gallbladder. Renal cell carcinoma rarely metastasizes to the gallbladder, and intraluminal polypoid masses are rarely encountered in such cases. The differential diagnosis for gallbladder polyps includes benign lesions such as cholesterol polyps and adenomas, as well as malignant lesions such as gallbladder carcinoma and metastatic lesions. This case highlights the importance of considering metastatic disease as a differential diagnosis when evaluating gallbladder polyps, particularly in patients with a history of renal cancer.",1
"Vitamin B12 and folate concentrations in serum and cerebrospinal fluid of neurological patients with special reference to multiple sclerosis and dementia.  Vitamin B12 and folate concentrations were measured in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in 293 neurological patients. The patients were divided into three groups: those with multiple sclerosis (MS), those with dementia, and those without either condition. The mean serum vitamin B12 level was significantly lower in patients with dementia compared to those without dementia. Additionally, the mean CSF vitamin B12 level was significantly higher in patients with MS compared to those without MS. In contrast, there were no significant differences in serum or CSF folate levels between the groups. Furthermore, there was no correlation between serum and CSF levels of vitamin B12 or folate. These findings suggest that abnormalities in vitamin B12 levels may be associated with the pathogenesis of dementia and multiple sclerosis, highlighting the importance of assessing both serum and CSF levels of vitamin B12 in neurological patients.",1
"Cavernous malformations and capillary telangiectasia: a spectrum within a single pathological entity. Cavernous malformations (CMs) and capillary telangiectasia (CT) are vascular lesions that share similar histopathological features. However, they have been traditionally described as separate entities. We present a case series of six patients with intracerebral vascular lesions that demonstrate the wide spectrum of CMs and CT within a single pathological entity. Each patient underwent imaging studies, including magnetic resonance imaging and angiography, and histopathological examination of surgical resection specimens. The findings revealed a continuum of vascular abnormalities ranging from classic CMs to CT. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated similar staining patterns for endothelial markers, suggesting a common pathogenesis. Clinically, all patients presented with neurological symptoms, including seizures and focal deficits. Overall, our findings support the notion that CMs and CT represent a spectrum of lesions with shared histopathological and clinical characteristics. Further investigation is warranted to better understand the underlying mechanisms and to develop targeted therapeutic approaches.",1
"Interleukin-8 production in red blood cell incompatibility. Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is a common intervention in patients with various medical conditions. However, incompatibility between the recipient and donor RBCs can lead to adverse reactions, including the release of inflammatory mediators. This study aimed to investigate the production of interleukin-8 (IL-8), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, in RBC incompatibility. 

Thirty-two patients who received incompatible RBC transfusions were included in the study. Blood samples were collected before and after the transfusion, and IL-8 levels were measured using ELISA. The results showed a significant increase in IL-8 production following incompatible RBC transfusion compared to baseline levels (p<0.001). Additionally, patients who experienced clinical symptoms related to the transfusion had higher IL-8 levels compared to asymptomatic patients (p=0.041). 

These findings suggest that incompatible RBC transfusion can stimulate the production of IL-8, which may contribute to the development of adverse transfusion reactions. Further research is required to explore the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate these inflammatory responses.",1

This case report highlights the need for increased awareness and surveillance of concurrent malignancies in individuals with rare genetic disorders such as XXY karyotype and CLL.",1
"Non-vesicular release of glutamate from glial cells by reversed electrogenic glutamate uptake. Glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, is known to be released from presynaptic vesicles in neurons. However, recent evidence suggests that glial cells, specifically astrocytes, also play a role in glutamate release. The mechanism and functional significance of glial glutamate release are still unclear. In this study, we investigated the possibility of non-vesicular release of glutamate from glial cells through reversed electrogenic glutamate uptake. Using a combination of electrophysiological and imaging techniques, we demonstrated that astrocytes are capable of releasing glutamate in a calcium-dependent manner. Furthermore, we found that this release is mediated by the reversal of the electrogenic glutamate transporter, resulting in glutamate efflux from the cells. Finally, we showed that this non-vesicular release of glutamate can modulate neuronal activity by activating postsynaptic glutamate receptors. These findings provide new insights into the complex interactions between neurons and astrocytes in the brain and highlight the potential role of glial glutamate release in physiological and pathological processes.",1
"Mechanism of fibrous capsule formation surrounding hepatocellular carcinoma. The formation of a fibrous capsule around hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a complex process that involves various cellular and molecular mechanisms. This study aimed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving the formation of the fibrous capsule in HCC. Tissue specimens from 30 HCC patients with a distinct fibrous capsule were analyzed. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to assess the expression of several key markers associated with fibrous capsule formation, including transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and fibronectin. The results revealed a significant upregulation of TGF-β, α-SMA, and fibronectin in the fibrous capsule compared to surrounding tumor tissues. Additionally, histological examination indicated an increased deposition of extracellular matrix components within the fibrous capsule. Our findings suggest that TGF-β signaling plays a crucial role in activating fibroblasts and promoting the synthesis and deposition of extracellular matrix proteins, leading to the formation of the fibrous capsule in HCC. Understanding the mechanisms involved in fibrous capsule formation may provide valuable insights for developing novel therapeutic strategies targeting the tumor microenvironment in HCC.",1
"Immunopathology of olfactory mucosa following injury to the olfactory bulb. Injury to the olfactory bulb can result in immunopathological changes in the olfactory mucosa. This study aimed to investigate the immunopathological alterations in the olfactory mucosa after injury to the olfactory bulb. Rat models were used to induce injury to the olfactory bulb through olfactory bulbectomy. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to evaluate changes in inflammatory markers and neurotrophic factors. Results showed a significant increase in the expression of inflammatory markers, such as interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α, in the injured olfactory mucosa compared to the control group. Additionally, a decrease in the expression of neurotrophic factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor and nerve growth factor, was observed in the injured olfactory mucosa. These findings suggest that injury to the olfactory bulb can lead to an immunopathological response in the olfactory mucosa, potentially contributing to olfactory dysfunction. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these immunopathological changes and their impact on olfactory function.",1
"Eosinophil activation in systemic sclerosis. Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by fibrosis of the skin and internal organs. Eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of SSc due to their ability to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and promote tissue remodeling. This study aimed to investigate the activation status of eosinophils in SSc patients. Blood samples were collected from 50 SSc patients and 30 healthy controls. Eosinophil activation markers, including eotaxin, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), were measured using ELISA. Results showed significantly higher levels of eotaxin, ECP, and EDN in SSc patients compared to controls. Furthermore, these markers were positively correlated with disease severity scores. These findings suggest that eosinophils are activated and may contribute to the pathogenesis of SSc. Further research is needed to elucidate the specific mechanisms by which eosinophils are involved in SSc and explore potential therapeutic targets.",1
"The role of antihistamines in the treatment of chronic urticaria.  For many years, H1 antihistamines have been the primary management option for urticaria. Chronic urticaria is a common skin disorder characterized by the recurrent appearance of wheals and itching lasting for more than 6 weeks. Antihistamines, specifically H1 receptor antagonists, have been widely used as the first-line treatment for this condition. These medications act by blocking the histamine receptor, thereby inhibiting the inflammatory response and alleviating symptoms. While the efficacy of antihistamines in managing acute urticaria is well-established, their role in chronic urticaria management is still under debate. Current evidence suggests that high-dose H1 antihistamines can effectively control symptoms in a significant number of patients. However, a proportion of patients remain refractory to antihistamine monotherapy, necessitating the addition of other treatment modalities such as non-sedating antihistamines, leukotriene receptor antagonists, or immunosuppressive agents. Further research is needed to optimize the treatment approach for chronic urticaria and to determine the most effective antihistamine regimen.",1
"Erythrocyte polyamine levels in human prostatic carcinoma. We conducted a study to investigate the levels of erythrocyte polyamines in patients with prostatic carcinoma. A total of 100 patients diagnosed with prostatic carcinoma and 100 age-matched healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Erythrocyte polyamine levels were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. Our findings revealed a significant increase in erythrocyte polyamine levels in patients with prostatic carcinoma compared to the control group (p<0.001). Specifically, the levels of spermine and spermidine were significantly elevated in the prostatic carcinoma group (p<0.001), while putrescine levels showed no significant difference between the two groups. Furthermore, within the prostatic carcinoma group, there was a significant positive correlation between erythrocyte polyamine levels and the clinical stage of the disease (p<0.001). These results suggest that erythrocyte polyamine levels may serve as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of prostatic carcinoma. Further research is warranted to explore the underlying mechanisms and evaluate the clinical utility of erythrocyte polyamines in prostatic carcinoma.",1
"High urinary cAMP in hypertensives despite careful drug treatment--an epidemiological study from the Dalby population.  The correlation between serum calcium (S-Ca), plasma parathyroid hormone (P-PTH) and hypertension was determined in a population-based, cross-sectional study of carefully treated hypertensives (n = 391; diastolic blood pressure 90. This study aimed to investigate the association between high urinary cAMP levels and hypertension despite careful drug treatment in the Dalby population. A cross-sectional, population-based study was conducted, including 391 carefully treated hypertensive individuals with a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg or above. The study measured serum calcium (S-Ca), plasma parathyroid hormone (P-PTH), and urinary cAMP levels in the participants. The results revealed a significant correlation between high urinary cAMP levels and hypertension, despite thorough drug treatment. Interestingly, there was no significant correlation observed between S-Ca or P-PTH and hypertension in this population. This suggests that high urinary cAMP levels may play a role in the pathogenesis or progression of hypertension, independent of serum calcium or parathyroid hormone levels. Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic implications of this finding.",1
"Injuries to the cervical spine causing vertebral artery trauma: case reports. We present two cases of cervical spine injuries resulting in vertebral artery trauma. Case 1 involved a 45-year-old male who presented with a C5-C6 facet dislocation after a motor vehicle accident. The subsequent vertebral artery dissection led to posterior circulation infarction and neurological deficits. Case 2 involved a 32-year-old female who suffered a C2-C3 fracture-dislocation following a fall from a height. Vertebral artery laceration was observed, leading to acute subarachnoid hemorrhage. Both patients underwent emergent decompression and stabilization of the cervical spine, along with endovascular repair of the injured vertebral artery. Despite intervention, Case 1 experienced persistent neurological deficits, while Case 2 had a complete vertebral artery occlusion, resulting in permanent brainstem injury. These cases highlight the importance of prompt recognition and management of vertebral artery trauma in patients with cervical spine injuries. A high level of suspicion, early imaging, and multidisciplinary collaboration are crucial for optimizing outcomes in these challenging cases.",1
"Multipiece tire rim injuries.  Multipiece tire rims can explode during tire change, causing severe injury. Multipiece tire rims can pose a significant risk of explosion during tire change procedures, resulting in severe and potentially life-threatening injuries. We present a case series of three patients who sustained complex and extensive traumatic injuries due to the explosive failure of multipiece tire rims. These injuries were characterized by a combination of high-energy mechanisms, including blast injuries, penetrating wounds, and soft tissue avulsions. The severity of these injuries necessitated prompt and aggressive management, including emergent surgical intervention, intensive care support, and extensive rehabilitation. Despite the comprehensive multidisciplinary approach, all three patients had a prolonged and challenging recovery course, with persistent functional deficits and psychological distress. Our case series highlights the need for increased awareness among medical professionals, mechanics, and general public regarding the potential hazards associated with multipiece tire rims. Furthermore, it emphasizes the importance of implementing safety measures, such as proper training, the use of personal protective equipment, and adherence to recommended guidelines to mitigate the risks of these injuries.",1
"Defective jejunal brush border membrane sodium/proton exchange in association with lethal familial protracted diarrhoea. Lethal familial protracted diarrhea (LFPD) is a rare and severe condition characterized by chronic diarrhea presenting shortly after birth. The underlying pathophysiology of LFPD remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the role of defective jejunal brush border membrane (BBM) sodium/proton exchange in the development of LFPD. We examined jejunal biopsy specimens from six infants with LFPD and compared them to control samples. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a significant reduction in the expression of sodium/proton exchanger 3 (NHE3) in the BBM of LFPD patients. Functional studies using brush border membrane vesicles demonstrated a marked impairment in sodium/proton exchange activity in LFPD cases. Additionally, genetic analysis revealed a homozygous mutation in the SLC9A3 gene encoding NHE3 in all LFPD patients. Our findings suggest that defective jejunal BBM sodium/proton exchange, secondary to NHE3 mutation, is associated with the development of LFPD. These findings contribute to our understanding of the pathogenesis of this debilitating condition and may have implications for future therapeutic strategies.",1
"The cutaneous manifestations in children with familial Mediterranean fever (recurrent hereditary polyserositis).  A six-year study. Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of fever and polyserositis. Cutaneous manifestations have been reported in a significant proportion of patients with FMF; however, limited data exists regarding the prevalence and characteristics of these manifestations in pediatric populations. This study aimed to investigate the cutaneous manifestations in children with FMF over a six-year period.
A retrospective chart review was conducted on pediatric patients diagnosed with FMF between 2014 and 2020. Demographic data, clinical features, and cutaneous manifestations were analyzed. Out of 150 pediatric patients with FMF, 48 (32%) presented with cutaneous manifestations. The most common cutaneous finding was erysipelas-like erythema (37.5%), followed by pseudovesicular rash (22.9%) and urticaria (20.8%). Of note, 9 patients (18.8%) developed cutaneous manifestations prior to the onset of fever and serositis. Our findings emphasize the importance of recognizing cutaneous manifestations in children with FMF, as they may precede other clinical features and lead to earlier diagnosis and management.",1
"Morphological features of blood access stenosis and results of noninvasive angioplasty. Blood access stenosis is a common problem in patients undergoing hemodialysis, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to investigate the morphological features of blood access stenosis and the results of noninvasive angioplasty in 50 patients with chronic kidney disease requiring hemodialysis. Doppler ultrasound was used to assess the blood flow velocity and vessel diameter at the stenotic site. Noninvasive angioplasty was performed using balloon dilatation. The results showed that blood access stenosis predominantly occurred in the upper arm arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and was characterized by focal, eccentric lesions with varying degrees of luminal narrowing. Noninvasive angioplasty successfully improved the blood flow velocity and vessel diameter in the majority of patients, resulting in improved blood access patency. These findings highlight the importance of early detection and intervention in blood access stenosis to optimize hemodialysis outcomes.",1
"Diclofenac-associated hepatotoxicity Diclofenac sodium, a phenylacetic acid-derived nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) recently released in the United States, was associated with the development of significant hepatitis in seven patients, with one associated death. We present a case series of diclofenac-associated hepatotoxicity, highlighting the potential risks of this newly released nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Seven patients developed significant hepatitis after starting diclofenac sodium, with one patient experiencing a fatal outcome. The patients presented with symptoms such as abdominal pain, jaundice, and elevated liver enzymes. Liver biopsies showed evidence of drug-induced liver injury, including necrosis and inflammation. All patients had previously used other NSAIDs without any liver-related adverse events. Given the increasing use of diclofenac worldwide, clinicians should be aware of the potential hepatotoxicity associated with this medication. Close monitoring of liver function tests is recommended for patients prescribed diclofenac, particularly in those with pre-existing liver disease or other risk factors for hepatotoxicity. Timely recognition and prompt cessation of diclofenac can potentially prevent severe liver injury and adverse outcomes.",1
"Bicarbonate-buffered lidocaine-epinephrine-hyaluronidase for eyelid anesthesia.  A double-masked, randomized clinical trial was conducted to determine if subcutaneous eyelid injections of a bicarbonate-buffered lidocaine-epinephrine-hyaluronidase mixture were less painful than unbuffered injections. A total of 80 patients scheduled for eyelid surgery were randomized into two groups: Group A received subcutaneous injections of 2% lidocaine with epinephrine and hyaluronidase mixture buffered with sodium bicarbonate, while Group B received unbuffered lidocaine-epinephrine-hyaluronidase injections. Pain scores were assessed using visual analog scale (VAS) scores immediately after injection and during the surgery. The mean VAS scores in Group A were significantly lower than those in Group B, indicating that bicarbonate-buffered lidocaine-epinephrine-hyaluronidase injections provided less pain during eyelid surgery. Thus, bicarbonate buffering of lidocaine-epinephrine-hyaluronidase mixture may be a promising approach for improving patient comfort during eyelid anesthesia.",1
"The papillary-cystic neoplasm of the pancreas.  An increasingly recognized clinicopathologic entity. Papillary-cystic neoplasm (PCN) of the pancreas is a rare but increasingly recognized clinicopathologic entity. PCN is typically found in young females, with the majority of cases occurring in the second and third decades of life. Clinically, patients may present with nonspecific symptoms such as abdominal pain and a palpable mass. Imaging studies often reveal a well-defined cystic mass with internal septations. Histologically, PCN is characterized by cystic spaces lined by tall columnar epithelium with papillary projections. The tumor is typically encapsulated and shows minimal cellular atypia. Immunohistochemistry is positive for trypsin and chymotrypsin, supporting the pancreatic origin. Surgical resection is the treatment of choice, with a favorable prognosis and low recurrence rate. Therefore, it is crucial for clinicians to be aware of PCN and consider it in the differential diagnosis of cystic pancreatic lesions.",1
"Iatrogenic illness in pediatric critical care.  Iatrogenic illness may be an important determinant of the need for pediatric intensive care. Iatrogenic illness, defined as illness caused by medical intervention, can significantly impact the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) setting. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and characteristics of iatrogenic illness in pediatric critical care. Medical records of children admitted to the PICU over a 6-month period were reviewed for iatrogenic events. Out of 250 patients, 30 experienced iatrogenic illness, representing a prevalence of 12%. The most common types of iatrogenic illness included medication errors (53%), hospital-acquired infections (20%), and mechanical complications (17%). The majority of iatrogenic events resulted in increased length of PICU stay (67%) and increased mortality (20%). These findings emphasize the importance of identifying and preventing iatrogenic illness in pediatric critical care, with the aim of improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare-associated harm. Further research is warranted to develop strategies for mitigating iatrogenic events in this vulnerable population.",1
"Endothelial markers in malignant vascular tumours of the liver: superiority of QB-END/10 over von Willebrand factor and Ulex europaeus agglutinin 1. Malignant vascular tumors of the liver, including angiosarcoma and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, pose diagnostic challenges due to their rarity and histological variability. This study evaluates the expression of endothelial markers, including von Willebrand factor (vWF), Ulex europaeus agglutinin 1 (UEA-1), and QB-END/10, in these tumors. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on liver tissue samples from 20 patients with malignant vascular tumors. QB-END/10 demonstrated superior sensitivity and specificity compared to vWF and UEA-1 in identifying endothelial cells in these tumors. QB-END/10 also showed a wider range of reactivity, including in tumor areas with minimal endothelial differentiation.

Out of the 80 patients, 23 experienced rebleeding during their hospital stay. We found that these patients exhibited significantly reduced platelet aggregability compared to those who did not experience rebleeding. Additionally, thromboxane B2 release was significantly lower in patients with rebleeding. Our findings suggest that reduced platelet aggregability and thromboxane release may be associated with rebleeding in SAH patients. Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and explore the potential use of platelet function testing as a prognostic marker in SAH patients.",1
"Retrospective application of prognostic indices to pancreatitis discovered at necropsy. Pancreatitis is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by inflammation of the pancreas. The prognosis of pancreatitis varies, with factors such as etiology, severity, and the presence of complications influencing the outcome. In this study, we aimed to retrospectively apply prognostic indices to cases of pancreatitis discovered at necropsy.

A total of 100 cases of pancreatitis were included in the study. The necropsies were performed on individuals who had succumbed to various causes, with pancreatitis being incidentally detected during the autopsy. Prognostic indices, including the Ranson's Criteria, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, and the Bedside Index of Severity in Acute Pancreatitis (BISAP), were calculated retrospectively based on the clinical and laboratory parameters documented during the hospitalization prior to the patients' demise.

The results indicated that the majority of the cases had a poor prognosis, as evidenced by high scores on the prognostic indices. Additionally, the presence of complications, such as necrotizing pancreatitis or organ failure, was associated with worse outcomes. These findings highlight the importance of accurate and timely diagnosis of pancreatitis, as well as the need for effective management to improve patient outcomes. Further prospective studies are warranted to validate the use of these prognostic indices in the clinical setting.",1
"Anterior segment ischemia: a complication of retinal detachment repair in a patient with sickle cell trait. Anterior segment ischemia is a rare complication following retinal detachment repair, typically occurring in patients with preexisting vascular conditions. We present a case of anterior segment ischemia in a patient with sickle cell trait who underwent retinal detachment repair. A 45-year-old African American male with sickle cell trait presented with a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment in his left eye. He underwent vitrectomy with scleral buckle placement and silicone oil tamponade. Postoperatively, the patient developed severe anterior chamber inflammation, iris atrophy, and neovascularization. Examination revealed anterior segment ischemia with iris and ciliary body non-perfusion. The patient was managed with aggressive anti-inflammatory therapy, topical and systemic steroids, and panretinal photocoagulation. Despite these interventions, the patient had persistent anterior segment ischemia with resulting visual impairment. This case highlights the potential risk of anterior segment ischemia in patients with sickle cell trait undergoing retinal detachment repair and underscores the importance of careful preoperative evaluation and appropriate management in these patients.",1

"Spinal cord compression from a thoracic paraganglioma: case report. This case report discusses a rare presentation of spinal cord compression caused by a thoracic paraganglioma. The patient, a 54-year-old female, presented with progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary incontinence. Imaging studies revealed a large mass arising from the right side of the T4 vertebral body, causing severe spinal cord compression. The patient underwent surgical resection of the tumor, which resulted in significant improvement in her neurological symptoms. Pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of a paraganglioma. Paragangliomas are rare neuroendocrine tumors that derive from paraganglia, specialized neural crest cells associated with the autonomic nervous system. While spinal paragangliomas are extremely rare, they should be considered in the differential diagnosis of spinal cord compression, especially when presenting with atypical symptoms such as urinary incontinence. Early diagnosis and prompt surgical intervention are crucial for achieving the best possible outcomes in patients with spinal paragangliomas. This case report highlights the importance of considering rare causes of spinal cord compression and the role of surgery in their management.",1
"Collagen phenotypes during development and regression of myocardial hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Myocardial hypertrophy is a common pathological condition associated with cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension. The extracellular matrix (ECM), especially collagen, plays a crucial role in cardiac remodeling during hypertrophy development and regression. In this study, we investigated the changes in collagen phenotypes during the progression and regression of myocardial hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Using histological and immunohistochemical analyses, we observed significant increases in collagen deposition in the myocardium of SHR during hypertrophy development. Furthermore, collagen phenotypes were found to change from predominantly type III collagen to type I collagen during this process. However, upon regression of hypertrophy after antihypertensive treatment, we observed a decrease in collagen deposition and a shift towards a more balanced ratio of types I and III collagens. These findings suggest that the dynamic changes in collagen phenotypes contribute to the remodeling process during myocardial hypertrophy, and may have implications for therapeutic interventions targeting ECM remodeling in cardiovascular diseases.",1
"Antibodies in anti-HBe-positive patient sera bind to an HBe protein expressed on the cell surface of human hepatoma cells: implications for virus clearance. In patients positive for anti-HBe antibodies, it has been observed that these antibodies can bind to the surface of hepatoma cells that express the HBe protein. This finding has important implications for virus clearance in these individuals. The presence of anti-HBe antibodies binding to HBe protein suggests that it may act as a target for immune responses against the virus. This interaction between antibodies and HBe protein may aid in the elimination of the virus from hepatoma cells, potentially leading to improved clinical outcomes. Further research is required to elucidate the precise mechanisms underlying this interaction and its role in virus clearance.",1

"Verbal memory impairment correlates with hippocampal pyramidal cell density. Verbal memory impairment is a common symptom in individuals with hippocampal dysfunction. However, the underlying cellular mechanisms linking hippocampal structure and verbal memory deficits remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the relationship between hippocampal pyramidal cell density and verbal memory performance. 

Using quantitative histological analysis, we measured the density of hippocampal pyramidal cells in postmortem brain tissue from individuals with varying levels of verbal memory impairment. We found a significant negative correlation between pyramidal cell density in the hippocampus and verbal memory performance, indicating that lower cell density is associated with poorer verbal memory abilities. 

These findings provide further evidence for the critical role of hippocampal pyramidal cells in supporting verbal memory processes. Understanding the cellular basis of verbal memory impairment may lead to the development of targeted interventions for individuals with hippocampal dysfunction and cognitive deficits.",1
"The encased ureter: bullet and bodkin pattern, a reliable radiographic sign. The encased ureter is a rare radiographic finding that can be observed in patients with ureteral obstruction. This study aims to evaluate the reliability of the bullet and bodkin pattern as a radiographic sign of an encased ureter. A retrospective review of 25 cases of encased ureters confirmed by surgical or histopathological findings was performed. The presence of the bullet and bodkin pattern on imaging studies, including intravenous urography and computed tomography, was assessed. The bullet and bodkin pattern was found in all cases of encased ureters, with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 92%.

"Lymphoproliferative disorders associated with carbamazepine. Carbamazepine is an anticonvulsant drug commonly used for the treatment of epilepsy and neuropathic pain. However, it has been associated with various hematological side effects, including lymphoproliferative disorders. We present a case of a 56-year-old man who developed cutaneous lymphoma following long-term carbamazepine therapy for trigeminal neuralgia. The patient presented with multiple erythematous patches and plaques on his face and scalp, which progressively increased in size. Biopsy revealed a predominantly T-cell lymphoma. Upon discontinuation of carbamazepine and initiation of chemotherapy, the skin lesions improved and the patient achieved complete remission. The underlying mechanism of carbamazepine-induced lymphoproliferative disorders is not clearly understood, but it is thought to involve immune dysregulation, genetic susceptibility, and drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions. It is important for healthcare providers to be aware of the potential association between carbamazepine and lymphoproliferative disorders, and consider this in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with skin lesions while on carbamazepine therapy.",1
"Decline in the prevalence of childhood deafness in the Jewish population of Jerusalem: ethnic and genetic aspects. This study aimed to investigate the decline in prevalence of childhood deafness in the Jewish population of Jerusalem, focusing on the ethnic and genetic aspects of this phenomenon. A retrospective analysis of medical records from a tertiary care center in Jerusalem revealed a significant decrease in the incidence of childhood deafness over a period of 10 years. The proportion of Jewish children with deafness decreased from 3.6% to 1.2%. Furthermore, within the Jewish population, a lower prevalence was observed among Ashkenazi Jews compared to Sephardic Jews. Genetic analysis revealed a higher frequency of recessive deafness-associated mutations among the Sephardic population, which may contribute to the higher prevalence of childhood deafness in this ethnic group. These findings suggest that advancements in genetic screening and counseling, as well as access to early intervention programs, have played a significant role in the decline of childhood deafness in the Jewish population of Jerusalem.",1
"Presymptomatic and prenatal diagnosis of myotonic muscular dystrophy with linked DNA probes. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and side effects of long-term cyclosporin A (CyA) maintenance therapy in 26 patients with severe psoriasis. The patients had an average Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score of 30.2 and were treated with CyA for an average duration of 19.5 months, ranging from 7 to 37 months. The patients were divided into three groups based on the CyA dose: less than 2 mg/kg per day, 2-3 mg/kg per day, and greater than 3 mg/kg per day. The efficacy of CyA was found to be similar in all three dose groups.

However, 12 out of the 26 patients had to discontinue CyA treatment due to nephrotoxicity and/or the development of hypertension. The discontinuation occurred in one patient in the less than 2 mg/kg per day group, three patients in the 2-3 mg/kg per day group, and eight patients in the greater than 3 mg/kg per day group. Notably, no hepatotoxicity was observed with CyA treatment.

Additionally, one patient developed two squamous cell carcinomas of the skin. These findings emphasize the need for careful monitoring of renal function and blood pressure during long-term CyA maintenance therapy in psoriasis patients.",1
"Repetitive conservative surgery for recurrence of endometriosis.  We evaluated the recovery of fertility and the relief of pain symptoms in a long-term follow-up of 42 women undergoing repetitive conservative surgery for recurrent endometriosis.  The mean age of the patients was 31. The mean duration of follow-up was 54 months.  Overall, 65% of the women were able to achieve pregnancy following the repetitive conservative surgery.

Further studies are warranted to validate these findings and to develop better treatment strategies for these patients.",1
"Changes in ventricular fibrillation threshold during the development of perinephritic hypertension. Perinephritic hypertension, characterized by elevated blood pressure and kidney dysfunction, is known to affect various physiological processes. Alterations in ventricular fibrillation threshold, a measure of the heart's susceptibility to develop life-threatening arrhythmias, have been observed in hypertensive conditions. This study aimed to investigate the changes in ventricular fibrillation threshold during the development of perinephritic hypertension. Using an animal model, perinephritic hypertension was induced by renal artery constriction. Longitudinal electrocardiographic measurements were obtained at regular intervals to assess ventricular fibrillation threshold. The results demonstrated a gradual decrease in ventricular fibrillation threshold as perinephritic hypertension developed, indicating an increased susceptibility to arrhythmias. Additionally, histopathological analysis revealed structural alterations in the myocardium, including fibrosis and hypertrophy, which may contribute to the observed changes in ventricular fibrillation threshold. Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets to prevent arrhythmias in patients with perinephritic hypertension.",1
"Post-transplant hypertension.  Post-transplant hypertension remains an important risk factor for cardiovascular mortality and graft function. Post-transplant hypertension is a common complication following solid organ transplantation, including kidney, liver, and heart transplantation. It is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality and adversely affects graft function. Despite advancements in immunosuppressive therapy, the prevalence of post-transplant hypertension remains high.

Various factors contribute to the development of hypertension in transplant recipients, including immunosuppressive agents, graft dysfunction, chronic renal insufficiency, and pre-existing hypertension. Management strategies often include lifestyle modifications and antihypertensive medications. However, the optimal therapy for post-transplant hypertension is not clearly defined.

This review aims to summarize the current understanding of post-transplant hypertension, including its pathophysiology, risk factors, and management options. We discuss the importance of strict blood pressure control in this population to minimize cardiovascular complications and preserve graft function. Additionally, we highlight the need for further research to identify the most effective treatment strategies and improve long-term outcomes in transplant recipients affected by hypertension.",1

"Interleukin 1 beta is expressed predominantly by enterocytes in experimental colitis. This study aimed to investigate the expression of interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) in experimental colitis and identify the cellular sources of this pro-inflammatory cytokine. Colitis was induced in mice by administration of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS), and changes in IL-1β expression were assessed using immunofluorescence and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. The results showed a significant upregulation of IL-1β in the colon tissue of mice with colitis compared to control mice. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that enterocytes, the absorptive cells of the intestinal epithelium, were the primary cellular source of IL-1β in inflamed colonic tissue. These findings suggest that enterocytes play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of experimental colitis by producing IL-1β. Further studies are warranted to investigate the functional significance of enterocyte-derived IL-1β and its potential as a therapeutic target in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases.",1
"Clustering of atherogenic behaviors in coffee drinkers. The aim of this study was to investigate the clustering of atherogenic behaviors in coffee drinkers. A total of 1,235 participants were included in the analysis, with a mean age of 45 years. Atherogenic behaviors were defined as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, sedentary lifestyle, and poor diet. Coffee consumption was assessed through a self-reported questionnaire. Logistic regression models were used to determine the associations between coffee consumption and atherogenic behaviors. After adjusting for confounding factors, it was found that coffee drinkers had a significantly higher likelihood of engaging in atherogenic behaviors compared to non-coffee drinkers (odds ratio = 1.45, 95% confidence interval: 1.13-1.86). Furthermore, a dose-response relationship was observed, with higher coffee consumption being associated with a higher clustering of atherogenic behaviors. These findings suggest that coffee drinkers are at increased risk of engaging in unhealthy behaviors that contribute to the development of atherosclerosis. Healthcare professionals should consider targeting this population with tailored interventions to promote healthier lifestyles.",1
"Relationship between duration of spinal cord ischemia and postoperative neurologic deficits in animals. Objective: To investigate the relationship between the duration of spinal cord ischemia and the development of postoperative neurologic deficits in animals.
Methods: A total of 50 animals (rats/mice) were subjected to spinal cord ischemia using a standardized protocol. The animals were divided into five groups based on the duration of induced ischemia: Group 1 (10 minutes), Group 2 (20 minutes), Group 3 (30 minutes), Group 4 (40 minutes), and Group 5 (control group without ischemia). Neurologic deficits were assessed using standardized neurologic scoring systems at regular intervals postoperatively.
Results: The results showed a clear association between the duration of spinal cord ischemia and the severity of postoperative neurologic deficits. Animals in Group 1 showed minimal deficits, while those in Group 2 exhibited moderate deficits. In contrast, animals in Groups 3, 4, and 5 demonstrated severe and progressive neurologic deficits. Statistical analysis confirmed a significant correlation between the duration of ischemia and the severity of deficits (p < 0.01). 
Conclusion: Prolonged spinal cord ischemia correlates with the development of more severe postoperative neurologic deficits in animals. These findings highlight the importance of timely interventions to minimize ischemic duration during spinal surgeries to improve patient outcomes.",1

This study aimed to evaluate the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis and classification of MRKHS. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 48 patients with suspected or confirmed MRKHS who underwent pelvic MRI between 2010 and 2018. MRI findings were correlated with clinical and surgical findings. MRI accurately diagnosed MRKHS in all cases, demonstrating the absence of the uterus and upper two-thirds of the vagina. Additional findings included varying degrees of vaginal agenesis and associated renal anomalies. MRI allowed for the classification of MRKHS based on vaginal length and severity of associated malformations. Furthermore, MRI provided valuable preoperative information for surgical planning, including the identification of suitable tissue for neovaginal creation. In conclusion, MRI is a reliable imaging modality for the diagnosis, classification, and surgical planning of MRKHS, providing essential information for optimal patient management.",1
"A multifocal schwannoma of the masseteric nerve causing hemicrania. Multifocal schwannomas are benign tumors derived from Schwann cells and commonly involve peripheral nerves. We present a rare case of a multifocal schwannoma involving the masseteric nerve, causing hemicrania. A 42-year-old male presented with severe unilateral temporal headache and difficulty in chewing. Clinical examination revealed a firm, non-tender mass in the masseteric region. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated multiple, well-defined, enhancing masses along the course of the masseteric nerve. Fine needle aspiration cytology of the mass confirmed the diagnosis of schwannoma. Surgical excision of the masses was performed, resulting in alleviation of the headache and improvement in chewing function. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a masseteric nerve schwannoma causing hemicrania. Multifocal schwannomas should be considered in the differential diagnosis of unilateral headache, especially when associated with facial pain or masseteric region abnormalities.",1
"Long-term outcome of massive small bowel resection.  The long-term outcome for seven patients 4-17 yr (mean 7. 5 yr) after massive small bowel resection was evaluated. All patients had extensive small bowel resection ranging from 80% to 90% of the total small bowel length. The main indications for surgery were short bowel syndrome due to multiple small bowel strictures in Crohn's disease (n = 4) and ischemic small bowel disease (n = 3). Six patients required long-term parenteral nutrition (PN), while one patient achieved enteral autonomy. Complications included central line-associated bloodstream infection, catheter-related thrombosis, and PN-associated liver disease. Four patients eventually developed intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD) requiring liver transplantation. The overall survival rate was 71.4% at a mean follow-up of 7.5 years. This study highlights the challenges faced by patients with massive small bowel resection and emphasizes the importance of multidisciplinary care in the management of these complex cases.

"Recent advance in treatment of Stanford type A aortic dissection. Stanford type A aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition that requires urgent medical intervention. Despite advancements in surgical techniques and perioperative care, the treatment of Stanford type A aortic dissection remains challenging. This abstract presents recent advances in the management of this condition.

The use of endovascular repair has gained popularity as an alternative to traditional open surgical repair. Endovascular techniques, such as thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR), have shown promising results in selected cases, especially in patients deemed unfit for open surgery or with complex anatomical characteristics. 

Furthermore, the development of hybrid approaches combining open surgical repair with endovascular techniques has shown improved outcomes and reduced mortality rates. Hybrid procedures allow for complete removal of the intimal tear while minimizing the extent of open surgery, thus reducing surgical morbidity and mortality.

In addition, the advent of novel pharmacological agents, such as angiotensin receptor blockers and beta-blockers, has shown potential in reducing aortic expansion and preventing further dissection.

In summary, recent advances in the treatment of Stanford type A aortic dissection include the utilization of endovascular repair, hybrid approaches, and the use of pharmacological agents.

"Misinterpretation of the upper parathyroid adenoma on thallium-201/technetium-99m subtraction scintigraphy.  Pre-operative thallium-technetium subtraction scintigraphy of 50 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, which was subsequently proven on histology to be due to an adenoma, was compared with operative findings. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of pre-operative thallium-technetium subtraction scintigraphy in detecting upper parathyroid adenomas in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. A total of 50 patients with histologically confirmed upper parathyroid adenoma were included in the study. The scintigraphy results were compared with the operative findings. The results showed that there was a high rate of misinterpretation of the upper parathyroid adenoma on thallium-technetium subtraction scintigraphy. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the scintigraphy in detecting upper parathyroid adenoma were found to be 62%, 80%, and 72%, respectively. The most common cause of misinterpretation was the overlap of the radioactivity of the upper parathyroid adenoma with adjacent structures, such as the thyroid gland. Therefore, caution should be exercised when interpreting thallium-technetium subtraction scintigraphy for the detection of upper parathyroid adenomas in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism.",1
"Serological arguments for classifying Raynaud's phenomenon as idiopathic.  Twenty-five patients with idiopathic Raynaud's phenomenon were followed prospectively for a mean period of 48 months. During the follow-up period, various serological markers were assessed to determine their association with idiopathic Raynaud's phenomenon. Results revealed no significant serological abnormalities that could be reliably used for classifying Raynaud's phenomenon as idiopathic. The absence of specific autoantibodies and other serological markers suggests that idiopathic Raynaud's phenomenon is a distinct entity without any clear underlying autoimmune or systemic disease etiology. This finding supports the notion that idiopathic Raynaud's phenomenon should be diagnosed based on clinical criteria rather than relying on serological markers. Further research is needed to elucidate the pathogenesis of idiopathic Raynaud's phenomenon and identify potential biomarkers for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.",1

"Tamm-Horsfall autoantibodies in interstitial cystitis.  Interstitial cystitis presents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. One possible mechanism underlying interstitial cystitis (IC) is the production of Tamm-Horsfall autoantibodies. A 45-year-old woman presented with symptoms of urinary urgency, frequency, and pelvic pain. Urinary analysis showed sterile pyuria, and cystoscopy revealed Hunner's ulcers in the bladder. Further investigation revealed the presence of Tamm-Horsfall autoantibodies in the patient's serum. These autoantibodies were reactive to the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) layer of the bladder, leading to its damage and subsequent inflammatory response. Treatment with intravesical instillations of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate, which restore the GAG layer, resulted in symptomatic relief and improved bladder function. This case highlights the potential role of Tamm-Horsfall autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of IC and suggests a therapeutic target for the management of this condition. Further research is warranted to fully understand the role of Tamm-Horsfall autoantibodies in IC and to explore other potential treatment modalities targeting this pathway.",1
"Haemorheological changes in patients with retinal vein occlusion after isovolaemic haemodilution. Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is a common retinal vascular disorder that can lead to severe visual impairment. Haemorheological changes, such as increased blood viscosity and reduced red blood cell deformability, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of RVO. This study aimed to investigate the effects of isovolaemic haemodilution (IH) on haemorheological parameters in patients with RVO.

The results showed that IH significantly reduced blood viscosity, enhanced red blood cell deformability, and improved microcirculation in patients with RVO. These findings suggest that IH may have therapeutic potential in the management of RVO by improving blood rheology. Further studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are warranted to confirm these findings and explore the underlying mechanisms. IH could be considered as an adjunctive treatment for patients with RVO to improve visual outcomes and reduce the risk of complications. ",1
Blood pressure response to dietary calcium intervention in humans. This study investigates the effect of dietary calcium intervention on blood pressure response in humans. Previous research suggests that calcium supplementation may have a positive impact on blood pressure regulation. The authors conducted a randomized controlled trial involving a sample of individuals with prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension. The participants were divided into two groups: a control group receiving a standard diet and an intervention group receiving a calcium-enriched diet. Blood pressure measurements were taken at baseline and at regular intervals throughout the study period. Results showed that the intervention group experienced a significant decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared to the control group. These findings suggest that dietary calcium intervention may be an effective non-pharmacological approach in managing blood pressure in individuals with prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this effect and to explore the long-term implications.,1
"Intraocular lens complications. Intraocular lenses (IOLs) are widely used in cataract surgery to restore vision. Complications associated with IOL implantation can significantly impact postoperative outcomes and patient satisfaction. This review aims to provide an overview of common complications related to IOL placement.

Postoperative complications can include various issues such as posterior capsule opacification, IOL decentration, and dislocation. Posterior capsule opacification, also known as secondary cataract, is the most frequent complication and occurs when the lens capsule becomes cloudy. Treatment options for this condition include YAG laser capsulotomy.

IOL decentration refers to the malpositioning of the lens within the capsular bag. It can lead to refractive errors, visual disturbances, and astigmatism. Surgical repositioning may be necessary to correct this complication.

IOL dislocation, although rare, can cause severe vision impairment and may require surgical intervention. Other complications, such as inflammation, infection, and retinal detachment, can also occur but are less common.

Surgeons should be aware of these potential complications and discuss them with patients before surgery. Adequate preoperative assessment, careful surgical technique, and postoperative monitoring can help minimize the occurrence of complications and improve patient outcomes.",1

A total of 87 patients were included, with 44 receiving allopurinol alone and 43 receiving the combination therapy. The patients were monitored for the development of new stone formation before, during, and after the discontinuation of the drug therapy. 

Our findings revealed that allopurinol alone significantly reduced the incidence of new stone formation during the treatment period. However, upon discontinuation of the therapy, the risk of new stone formation increased. In contrast, the combination of allopurinol and thiazide showed a greater preventive effect on new stone formation, even after discontinuation of the therapy. 

These results suggest that the use of allopurinol, particularly in combination with thiazide, may help in preventing the recurrence of calcium-containing urinary stones. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the long-term effects and optimal duration of this combined therapy.",1
"Safe performance of difficult laparoscopic cholecystectomies. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a commonly performed procedure for the treatment of gallbladder disease. However, in certain cases, the surgery can be challenging and carry a higher risk of complications. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the safety and outcomes of difficult laparoscopic cholecystectomies. We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of patients who underwent difficult laparoscopic cholecystectomy, defined by factors such as acute cholecystitis, dense adhesions, or anatomical variations. We assessed intraoperative and postoperative complications, conversion to open surgery, operative time, length of hospital stay, and patient outcomes. Our results demonstrated that despite the technical challenges, difficult laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be performed safely with low rates of major complications. However, appropriate patient selection, meticulous surgical technique, and intraoperative decision-making are crucial in ensuring successful outcomes. Further prospective studies are warranted to validate these findings and optimize the management of difficult laparoscopic cholecystectomies.",1
"Upper-airway obstruction after multilevel cervical corpectomy for myelopathy.  We reviewed the cases of seven patients who had had obstruction of the upper airway immediately after an anterior procedure on the cervical spine and had required reintubation. The patients all underwent multilevel cervical corpectomy for myelopathy. The mean age was 54 years, with a range of 38 to 67 years. The average follow-up time was 19 months. The most common cause of myelopathy was degenerative cervical spondylosis. All patients had anterior cervical discectomy and fusion with corpectomy performed at two or more levels. Following extubation, they developed upper-airway obstruction requiring reintubation. The etiology of the obstruction was found to be edema and hemorrhage around the anterior cervical spine surgical site. Surgical ligation of the bleeding vessels and treatment with anti-inflammatory medications led to resolution of the airway obstruction. In conclusion, upper-airway obstruction following multilevel cervical corpectomy for myelopathy is a rare complication that can be managed with appropriate intervention.",1
"Gastroesophageal reflux and sclerotherapy strictures. Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is a common condition characterized by the backflow of gastric contents into the esophagus. It can lead to various complications, including esophageal strictures. Sclerotherapy, a widely used treatment for esophageal varices, involves injecting a sclerosing agent into varicose veins, which can also result in esophageal strictures. This retrospective study aimed to investigate the association between GER and the development of sclerotherapy-induced strictures. The study included 48 patients with liver cirrhosis who underwent sclerotherapy for esophageal varices. GER was present in 36 patients (75%), and 19 (40%) developed strictures following sclerotherapy. Of those with strictures, 13 (68%) had GER. The presence of GER was significantly associated with an increased risk of developing sclerotherapy-induced strictures (p < 0.05). These findings highlight the importance of managing GER in patients undergoing sclerotherapy to prevent the development of esophageal strictures.",1

Prophylaxis of deep venous thrombosis after acute abdominal operation. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is a serious postoperative complication that occurs frequently after acute abdominal operations. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of prophylactic measures for DVT in this specific patient population. A total of 200 patients undergoing acute abdominal operations were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either mechanical prophylaxis (intermittent pneumatic compression devices) or pharmacological prophylaxis (low molecular weight heparin). Postoperative DVT was assessed using duplex ultrasonography. The results showed that the incidence of DVT was significantly lower in the pharmacological prophylaxis group compared to the mechanical prophylaxis group (p<0.001). No major bleeding complications were observed in either group. These findings suggest that pharmacological prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin is more effective in preventing DVT after acute abdominal operations. Further studies are warranted to confirm these results and determine the optimal duration of prophylactic treatment.,1

"Apparent reduction in the size of one side of the face associated with a small retrosplenial haemorrhage. We report a case of apparent facial asymmetry in a patient with a small retrosplenial haemorrhage. A 54-year-old female presented with sudden-onset facial drooping and weakness on the left side. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a small haemorrhage in the retrosplenial region of the brain. The patient's facial asymmetry was attributed to the direct compression of facial nerve fibers by the haemorrhage. No other neurological deficits were observed, and the patient's symptoms resolved with conservative management. Facial asymmetry can be a rare presenting symptom of a small retrosplenial haemorrhage, and clinicians should consider this possibility when evaluating patients with facial weakness. Further studies are needed to explore the underlying mechanisms of facial nerve involvement in cases of retrosplenial haemorrhage.",1
"Work and power in gait of stroke patients. This study aimed to assess the relationship between work and power in the gait of stroke patients. Thirty-five patients with chronic hemiparesis due to stroke were included in the study. Gait analysis was conducted using a motion capture system and force plates to measure spatiotemporal parameters, joint kinematics and kinetics. Work and power were calculated for each lower limb joint during stance phase of gait. The results showed that stroke patients had significantly decreased work and power at the affected side compared to the unaffected side. There was also a significant correlation between work and power at the affected side and walking speed. Additionally, work and power were significantly correlated with muscle strength and motor impairment. These findings suggest that work and power measures can provide valuable information about the functional limitations in stroke patients and may be useful for evaluating the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions.",1
"Aggressive granulomatous lesions in cementless total hip arthroplasty.  We describe six patients with aggressive granulomatous lesions around cementless total hip prostheses. Aggressive granulomatous lesions in cementless total hip arthroplasty are a rare complication. In this case series, we report six patients who developed such lesions around their cementless total hip prostheses. The lesions presented as painful masses and were diagnosed through histopathological examination. The patients underwent surgical excision of the lesions and all were treated with long-term antibiotics. In addition, one patient required prosthesis revision.

The etiology of these granulomatous reactions remains unclear. It has been suggested that an immunological response to wear particles, infection, or a combination of both could be responsible. In our case series, three patients had evidence of infection, while the remaining three had non-infectious granulomas. Regardless of the etiology, early detection and appropriate management are crucial to prevent further complications and ensure favorable outcomes.

In conclusion, aggressive granulomatous lesions around cementless total hip arthroplasty can occur with variable etiologies. Prompt diagnosis, surgical excision, antibiotic treatment, and, if necessary, prosthesis revision are integral to achieving successful outcomes.

"Can the blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio distinguish upper from lower gastrointestinal bleeding? We wanted to know if the blood urea nitrogen to creatinine (BUN/Cr) ratio could help distinguish upper from lower gastrointestinal bleeding.  We analyzed retrospectively patients admitted to our hospital for gastrointestinal bleeding over the past 5 years. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) require different management strategies, making an accurate and prompt diagnosis crucial. This study aimed to determine whether the blood urea nitrogen to creatinine (BUN/Cr) ratio could serve as a differentiating factor between UGIB and LGIB. Retrospective analysis was performed on patients admitted to our hospital with gastrointestinal bleeding over a 5-year period. Data on BUN, Cr, and clinical characteristics were collected. A total of 245 patients were included, with 140 diagnosed with UGIB and 105 with LGIB. The mean BUN/Cr ratio was significantly higher in the UGIB group compared to the LGIB group (p<0.001). Logistic regression analysis revealed that the BUN/Cr ratio was an independent predictor of UGIB (odds ratio: 2.176, 95% confidence interval: 1.480-3.198, p<0.001). In conclusion, the BUN/Cr ratio may serve as a valuable tool in differentiating UGIB from LGIB and assisting in timely management decisions.",1
"Acute syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis.  Six patients with evidence of secondary syphilis presented with visual loss in both eyes caused by large, placoid, yellowish lesions with faded centers at the level of the pigment epithelium in the macula and juxtapapillary areas. All patients had positive serologic tests for syphilis, and cerebrospinal fluid examination revealed an elevated protein level or pleocytosis. None of the patients had a history of ocular symptoms. The visual acuity varied from counting fingers to 20/30. Fluorescein angiography showed early hypofluorescence followed by late hyperfluorescence in the macular lesions, suggestive of leakage from the retinal pigment epithelium. Optical coherence tomography demonstrated disruption of the outer retinal layers in the affected areas.

"Gastric contents retained in rat stomach following mild irritant exposure contribute to adaptive cytoprotection.  Fluid retained in the gastric lumen immediately preceding the administration of a damaging product will dilute that product and decrease its injurious capacity. In this study, we investigated the role of gastric contents in adaptive cytoprotection following mild irritant exposure. Male rats were divided into two groups: one group received mild irritant exposure by administration of 0.6 M HCl, and the other group served as controls. Gastric contents were collected immediately before the administration of the irritant and analyzed for pH and volume. The results showed that the gastric contents retained in the stomach prior to the administration of the irritant significantly affected its injurious capacity. Dilution of the irritant by the retained gastric fluid resulted in decreased gastric injury in the experimental group compared to the control group.

"Non-vesicular release of glutamate from glial cells by reversed electrogenic glutamate uptake. Glutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, and its release is tightly regulated by neurons and glial cells. While vesicular release of glutamate from neurons has been extensively studied, there is growing evidence that glial cells also contribute to glutamate release through non-vesicular mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the role of reversed electrogenic glutamate uptake in non-vesicular glutamate release from glial cells. We found that blocking the glial glutamate transporter GLT-1 with specific inhibitors resulted in an increase in extracellular glutamate levels. Furthermore, using electrophysiological techniques, we demonstrated that glial cells exhibit a reversal potential for glutamate uptake, indicating the presence of a reversed electrogenic glutamate uptake mechanism. Our findings suggest that glial cells can release glutamate into the extracellular space through a non-vesicular process involving reversed electrogenic glutamate uptake. Further understanding of these mechanisms may have implications for the regulation of glutamate homeostasis and excitatory neurotransmission in the brain.",1
"Major histocompatibility complex antigen expression in the affected tissues in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  Monoclonal antibody immunocytochemistry was used to examine spinal cord and muscle in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis for changes that would indicate ongoing or potential immune activity. The authors investigated major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen expression in affected tissues of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) using monoclonal antibody immunocytochemistry. They examined the spinal cord and muscle tissues for changes indicative of ongoing or potential immune activity. In ALS patients, abnormal MHC antigen expression was observed in both spinal cord and muscle tissues. The expression pattern suggested the activation of immune responses, specifically in the form of a focal and diffuse distribution of MHC antigens in affected neurons and glial cells. These findings support the hypothesis that neuroinflammation plays a role in the pathogenesis of ALS. The presence of MHC antigens in muscle tissue suggests potential immune-mediated muscle damage. Understanding the immune processes involved in ALS may provide insights into disease mechanisms and help identify potential therapeutic targets.",1
"Management of selected cystic adnexal masses in postmenopausal women by operative laparoscopy: a pilot study.  Twenty-five postmenopausal patients were predicted to have benign masses by screening criteria that included ultrasonographic findings of a cystic adnexal mass less than 10 cm with distinct borders and no evidence of irregular solid parts, thick septa, ascites, or matted bowel, and a normal serum CA 125 value (less than 35 U/ml). All patients underwent operative laparoscopy for definitive diagnosis and management of the cystic adnexal masses. The laparoscopic procedure was successful in confirming the benign nature of the masses in all 25 patients. There were no intraoperative complications or conversions to laparotomy. Postoperative outcomes were favorable, with no cases of postoperative infection, hematoma, or other surgical complications. This pilot study suggests that operative laparoscopy can be a safe and effective approach for the management of selected cystic adnexal masses in postmenopausal women, enabling accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment while minimizing potential risks associated with more invasive procedures.",1
"Perivascular innervation of the cerebral arteries in spontaneously hypertensive rats--an immunohistochemical study. This study aimed to investigate the perivascular innervation of cerebral arteries in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) through immunohistochemical analysis.

We examined the distribution and density of perivascular nerves in the cerebral arteries of SHR and compared them with normotensive control rats. Using specific markers for nerve fibers, we observed a significant increase in perivascular innervation in the cerebral arteries of SHR compared to controls. Additionally, we found alterations in the distribution pattern and density of sympathetic and sensory nerve fibers in the hypertensive rats. These findings suggest that the perivascular innervation plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of hypertension and may provide insights into the development of novel therapeutic approaches targeting the neurovascular system in hypertensive conditions.",1
"Lung injury in a surfactant-deficient lung is modified by indomethacin. Surfactant deficiency is a common cause of acute lung injury and respiratory distress syndrome in neonates. This study aimed to investigate the effect of indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, on lung injury in a surfactant-deficient lung. Twenty-four neonatal rabbits were divided into three groups: control, surfactant-deficient, and surfactant-deficient with indomethacin treatment. Lung injury was induced by intra-tracheal administration of saline in the surfactant-deficient groups. The surfactant-deficient group showed significant histological changes indicative of lung injury compared to the control group. However, the surfactant-deficient group with indomethacin treatment had significantly reduced lung injury compared to the surfactant-deficient group. This was evidenced by histological improvements, decreased lung wet-to-dry weight ratio, and reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines. These findings suggest that indomethacin may have a protective effect against lung injury in surfactant-deficient lungs, providing a potential therapeutic option for neonates with respiratory distress syndrome. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of this protective effect.",1

"Effects of radiation therapy on skeletal growth in childhood. Radiation therapy is an essential treatment modality for various pediatric malignancies; however, its effects on skeletal growth warrant attention. This retrospective study aimed to examine the impact of radiation therapy on skeletal growth in childhood. The medical records of 100 pediatric patients who received radiation therapy for different malignancies were reviewed. Height and bone age data were collected at regular intervals over a five-year period following radiation therapy completion. Results revealed a significant reduction in skeletal growth velocity post-radiation therapy compared to pre-treatment values (p<0.001). Furthermore, a delayed skeletal age was observed, with an average delay of 2.5 years (p<0.05). The severity of growth retardation was influenced by several factors, including radiation dose, treatment duration, and age at the initiation of therapy. Additionally, site-specific effects, such as vertebral column irradiation, were associated with more profound growth impairment. Notably, higher doses of radiation delivered to the growth plates and younger age at the initiation of therapy were major determinants of growth retardation. These findings emphasize the importance of monitoring skeletal growth in pediatric patients receiving radiation therapy and the need for appropriate management strategies to mitigate potential growth impairment.",1
"Clinical spectrum of leber's congenital amaurosis in the second to fourth decades of life. Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA) is a rare inherited retinal dystrophy characterized by severe visual impairment from early infancy. However, there is limited knowledge about the clinical presentation of LCA beyond childhood. This study aimed to investigate the clinical spectrum of LCA in individuals aged between their second and fourth decades of life. 

A total of 50 patients with genetically confirmed LCA were included in this retrospective case series. Clinical data, including visual acuity, fundus examination, electroretinography, and molecular genetic analysis, were collected and analyzed.

The results showed a wide range of phenotypic variability in this age group. While the majority of patients (70%) still had severely impaired vision, a significant proportion (30%) had stable or even improved visual acuity compared to childhood. Additionally, a subset of patients displayed atypical fundus changes and had additional ocular and non-ocular features.

This study highlights the need for further investigation to better understand the progression and clinical features of LCA beyond childhood. Improved knowledge of the clinical spectrum of LCA in older individuals may aid in the development of targeted interventions and management strategies for this group of patients.",1
"Quadriceps myopathy: forme fruste of Becker muscular dystrophy. Quadriceps myopathy is a rare disorder characterized by weakness and wasting of the quadriceps muscles. We present a case report of a 35-year-old male with bilateral quadriceps weakness and wasting, suggestive of quadriceps myopathy. Genetic testing revealed a deletion mutation in the dystrophin gene, confirming the diagnosis of Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). BMD is a subtype of muscular dystrophy characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting, typically affecting the proximal lower limb muscles. However, in our case, the presentation was atypical with isolated involvement of the quadriceps muscles. This represents a forme fruste or milder variant of BMD, further highlighting the phenotypic heterogeneity of this condition. Clinicians should consider BMD in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with isolated quadriceps myopathy, as early recognition and appropriate management can significantly improve patient outcomes.",1
"Response of spinal cord blood flow and motor and sensory evoked potentials to aortic ligation. Aortic ligation can lead to significant changes in spinal cord blood flow and impair motor and sensory function. In this study, we evaluated the response of spinal cord blood flow and motor and sensory evoked potentials to aortic ligation in a group of 30 patients. Aortic ligation resulted in a significant decrease in spinal cord blood flow, with a mean reduction of 45%. Motor and sensory evoked potentials were also significantly affected, with a mean decrease of 50% compared to baseline. The severity of these changes correlated with the duration of aortic ligation. These findings highlight the importance of monitoring spinal cord blood flow and evoked potentials during aortic surgeries to prevent spinal cord ischemia and minimize the risk of post-operative neurological deficits.",1
"Prediagnostic serum levels of carotenoids and vitamin E as related to subsequent cancer in Washington County, Maryland. The relationship between prediagnostic serum levels of carotenoids and vitamin E and the risk of developing cancer was investigated in a cohort study conducted in Washington County, Maryland. A total of 500 participants were followed for a median of 10 years. Serum samples were collected at baseline and analyzed for levels of carotenoids (including alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, lycopene, and beta-cryptoxanthin) and vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol). Incident cases of cancer were identified through linkage to cancer registries.

After adjusting for potential confounders, higher serum levels of carotenoids and vitamin E were associated with a significant reduction in the risk of developing cancer. Specifically, participants in the highest quartile of carotenoid and vitamin E levels had a 30% lower risk of cancer compared to those in the lowest quartile. 

These findings suggest that higher levels of carotenoids and vitamin E may have a protective effect against cancer development. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this association and to explore potential interventions for cancer prevention.",1
"Recovery from vegetative state of six months' duration associated with Sinemet (levodopa/carbidopa). We present a case of a patient who experienced a remarkable recovery from a vegetative state after receiving Sinemet (levodopa/carbidopa) therapy. The patient had been in this state for six months following a traumatic brain injury. Sinemet was initiated as a trial treatment for possible dopamine deficiency, although there was limited evidence supporting its use in this context. Surprisingly, the patient demonstrated significant improvements in arousal, language comprehension, and motor function within two weeks of starting Sinemet. These improvements persisted over a one-year follow-up period. This case suggests that Sinemet may have a potential role in the recovery of patients with prolonged vegetative state and warrants further investigation into its mechanism of action in this population.",1

"Transferrin receptor activity as a marker in transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) is the most common type of bladder cancer, and its diagnosis and prognosis are often challenging. The current study aimed to evaluate the utility of transferrin receptor activity (TRA) as a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker in TCC of the bladder. Tumor tissue samples were collected from 120 patients with histologically confirmed TCC, and TRA levels were assessed using immunohistochemistry. The results demonstrated a significant upregulation of TRA in TCC compared to adjacent non-neoplastic bladder tissue (p<0.001). Furthermore, higher TRA levels were associated with advanced tumor stage, high grade, and lymph node metastasis (p<0.05). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with elevated TRA had significantly shorter overall survival and progression-free survival compared to those with low TRA levels (p<0.001). In multivariate analysis, TRA remained an independent prognostic factor for survival outcomes (p=0.001). Therefore, TRA may serve as a valuable diagnostic and prognostic marker in TCC, aiding in the identification of high-risk patients who may benefit from more aggressive treatment strategies.",1

"Clinical recognition and evaluation of peptic ulcer disease. Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is a common gastrointestinal disorder characterized by mucosal erosion and ulceration in the stomach or duodenum. Prompt recognition and accurate evaluation of PUD are crucial for appropriate management. This review aims to summarize the clinical features and diagnostic tools used in the evaluation of PUD.

Patients with PUD typically present with epigastric pain, which is often described as burning or gnawing in nature. Other symptoms may include bloating, heartburn, early satiety, or unintentional weight loss. In some cases, PUD can lead to serious complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, or gastric outlet obstruction.

Several diagnostic modalities are available for the evaluation of PUD, including upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, barium swallow, and Helicobacter pylori testing. Upper endoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosing PUD, allowing direct visualization of ulcers and obtaining biopsies for histopathological examination. H. pylori testing is crucial as the eradication of this bacterium significantly reduces the risk of recurrent ulcers.

In conclusion, early recognition and accurate evaluation of PUD are essential for appropriate management and prevention of complications. Familiarity with the clinical features and diagnostic tools discussed in this review can aid clinicians in providing optimal care for patients with PUD.",1
"Persistent mullerian duct syndrome. Persistent Mullerian Duct Syndrome (PMDS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the presence of male internal reproductive organs despite the presence of male external genitalia. It is caused by a failure in the regression of the Mullerian ducts during fetal development, resulting in the persistence of the uterus, fallopian tubes, and upper vagina in an otherwise phenotypically male individual. PMDS is typically diagnosed incidentally during surgery for cryptorchidism or inguinal hernia repair.

We present a case of a 15-year-old male who presented with bilateral cryptorchidism. During the surgical exploration, the presence of a uterus and fallopian tubes was noted. Further evaluation revealed a 46,XY karyotype with normal male hormone levels. The diagnosis of PMDS was made, and the patient underwent a bilateral orchidopexy and removal of the uterus and fallopian tubes.

PMDS poses unique challenges in management due to the potential for complications such as testicular torsion, hernia formation, and malignancy. Surgical intervention with removal of the Mullerian structures is the mainstay of treatment to prevent these complications. Regular follow-up with hormonal evaluation and imaging should be conducted to monitor for any recurrence or development of associated conditions.

"Long-term potentiation of electrotonic coupling at mixed synapses. Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a widely studied phenomenon in the field of neuroscience, particularly in relation to synaptic plasticity and learning and memory processes. Mixed synapses, which contain both electrical and chemical components, have been shown to play a crucial role in synaptic plasticity. However, the mechanisms underlying the modulation of electrotonic coupling at these synapses during LTP remain unclear. In this study, using electrophysiological recordings in hippocampal slices from rats, we investigated the long-term changes in electrotonic coupling at mixed synapses. Our results demonstrate a significant increase in electrotonic coupling strength following high-frequency stimulation, indicative of long-term potentiation. This potentiation was found to be dependent on the activation of NMDA receptors and was accompanied by a decrease in synaptic depression, suggesting a possible mechanistic link between electrotonic coupling and synaptic efficacy. These findings contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying long-term plasticity at mixed synapses and shed light on the potential role of electrotonic coupling in synaptic transmission and information processing.",1

"Speech, velopharyngeal function, and hearing before and after orthognathic surgery.  Articulation, voice, resonance, hearing sensitivity, and middle ear function were examined in 34 patients before and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after orthognathic surgery. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of orthognathic surgery on speech, velopharyngeal function, and hearing in a cohort of 34 patients. Prior to surgery and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-operatively, various parameters including articulation, voice quality, resonance, hearing sensitivity, and middle ear function were evaluated. Results showed a significant improvement in speech parameters following orthognathic surgery. Specifically, there was an enhancement in articulation, voice quality, and resonance as evidenced by reduced nasality and improved speech intelligibility. Additionally, hearing sensitivity remained stable throughout the post-operative period, suggesting that orthognathic surgery does not have a detrimental effect on auditory function. Middle ear function was also unaffected by the surgical procedure. These findings suggest that orthognathic surgery can positively impact speech outcomes and does not have adverse effects on velopharyngeal function or hearing.",1
"Osteoid osteoma of the scapula. Osteoid osteoma is a benign bone tumor that predominantly affects long bones, particularly in the lower extremities. However, its occurrence in the scapula, a flat bone, is rare. We present a case of a 32-year-old female who presented with persistent shoulder pain and limited range of motion. Imaging studies revealed a small osteoid osteoma in the scapula. Due to the unusual location and atypical presentation, the tumor was initially misdiagnosed as a soft tissue lesion. Surgical excision was performed, and histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of osteoid osteoma. This case highlights the importance of considering osteoid osteoma as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with shoulder pain, even in the absence of typical long bone involvement. Timely diagnosis and appropriate management can alleviate symptoms and prevent complications associated with osteoid osteoma.",1
"Role of membrane proteins in monosodium urate crystal-membrane interactions. Monosodium urate (MSU) crystals are the causative agent in gout, a painful inflammatory arthritis. The interaction between MSU crystals and cell membranes plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of gout, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This review aimed to investigate the role of membrane proteins in MSU crystal-membrane interactions. Several membrane proteins have been identified to participate in this process, including toll-like receptors (TLRs), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLRs), and phospholipase C. These proteins recognize and bind to MSU crystals, initiating intracellular signaling cascades that trigger the activation of inflammatory pathways and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, membrane proteins such as CD14 and CD36 have been implicated in MSU crystal phagocytosis by macrophages. Understanding the interplay between MSU crystals and membrane proteins may provide insight into the development of novel therapeutic strategies for gout and related inflammatory diseases. Further research is needed to elucidate the specific roles and mechanisms of these membrane proteins in MSU crystal-membrane interactions.",1
"Topographic mapping of electrophysiologic measures in patients with homonymous hemianopia We analyzed electroencephalographic (EEG) activity and spatial distribution of the pattern-reversal visual evoked potential (PVEP) in 20 patients with unilateral lesions in the retrochiasmal visual pathways. The aim of this study was to investigate the topographic mapping of electrophysiologic measures in patients with homonymous hemianopia. Twenty patients with unilateral lesions in the retrochiasmal visual pathways were included in the study. Electroencephalographic (EEG) activity and spatial distribution of the pattern-reversal visual evoked potential (PVEP) were analyzed. The results showed significant differences in PVEP amplitude between the affected and unaffected visual fields. There was also a significant correlation between PVEP amplitude and EEG activity in the affected visual field. Topographic mapping revealed abnormal electrical activity in the affected hemisphere, with a specific pattern of reduced amplitude and prolonged latency. These findings suggest that the deficits in visual function observed in patients with homonymous hemianopia are associated with abnormal electrophysiologic measures in the affected visual pathways. Topographic mapping of electrophysiologic measures may provide valuable information for the diagnosis and management of patients with homonymous hemianopia. Further studies are needed to fully understand the implications of these findings.",1
"Chondrosarcoma of the head and neck.  Chondrosarcoma is a malignancy rarely encountered in the head and neck. Chondrosarcoma is a rare malignancy that typically affects the skeletal system, with only a few cases reported in the head and neck region.

In this survey covering 2216 cases (89 volunteers and 2127 endoscopy patients), the incidence of H. pylori infection was found to be 60.8%. The highest prevalence was observed in the age group of 50-59 years with a rate of 77.8%, while the lowest prevalence was seen in the age group of 10-19 years with a rate of 26.1%. There was a significant difference in the prevalence of H. pylori infection between urban and rural areas, with urban areas having a higher prevalence rate of 69.7% compared to rural areas with a rate of 51.6%. These findings provide important insights into the epidemiology of H. pylori infection in the Peoples Republic of China and highlight the need for targeted prevention and treatment strategies.",1
"The induction dose of propofol in infants 1-6 months of age and in children 10-16 years of age.  The propofol dose needed for satisfactory induction of anesthesia was determined in 22 infants 1-6 months of age and 22 children 10-16 yr of age. The induction dose of propofol was evaluated in 22 infants aged 1-6 months and 22 children aged 10-16 years for satisfactory induction of anesthesia. The mean propofol dose required for induction in the infants was 3.2 mg/kg (range 2.5-4 mg/kg), while in the children it was 2.5 mg/kg (range 2-3 mg/kg). There were no significant differences in the required dose between the two age groups. No immediate complications or adverse events were observed during or after the induction. These findings suggest that propofol can be safely and effectively used for anesthesia induction in both infants and children within the specified age ranges.",1
"Experimental retinal branch vein occlusion in miniature pigs induces local tissue hypoxia and vasoproliferative microangiopathy. Retinal branch vein occlusion (BRVO) is a common retinal vascular disorder leading to vision loss. This study aimed to develop an experimental model of BRVO in miniature pigs and assess its effects on local tissue oxygen levels and microangiopathy. BRVO was induced in 14 miniature pigs by laser photocoagulation, and retinal oxygen levels were measured using a non-invasive oxygen tension sensor. Histological analysis revealed significant endothelial cell loss, capillary occlusions, and neovascularization in the occluded areas, consistent with vasoproliferative microangiopathy. Additionally, decreased retinal oxygen tension was observed in the occluded areas compared to unaffected regions. The use of miniature pigs as an animal model for BRVO offers a valuable tool for investigating the pathogenesis and potential treatments of this disease.",1
"Vitamin C and cancer prevention: the epidemiologic evidence.  Epidemiologic evidence of a protective effect of vitamin C for non-hormone-dependent cancers is strong. Numerous epidemiologic studies have investigated the potential role of vitamin C in cancer prevention. The evidence for a protective effect of vitamin C against non-hormone-dependent cancers, such as lung, stomach, and colorectal cancers, is compelling. These findings are supported by both cohort and case-control studies, which consistently demonstrate a decreased risk of these cancers with higher vitamin C intake or blood levels. Mechanistically, vitamin C may act as an antioxidant, neutralizing harmful free radicals that can damage DNA and promote carcinogenesis. In addition, it may enhance the immune system's ability to recognize and destroy cancer cells. However, conflicting results have been reported for hormone-dependent cancers, such as breast and prostate cancers, indicating a more complex relationship between vitamin C and these malignancies. Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms and to explore potential interactions between vitamin C and other nutrients or lifestyle factors in cancer prevention.",1
"Hemodynamic effects of H2-receptor antagonists. H2-receptor antagonists are widely used in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and peptic ulcers, but their potential hemodynamic effects have not been extensively studied. This study aimed to evaluate the hemodynamic effects of H2-receptor antagonists in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 100 patients with GERD. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either H2-receptor antagonists or placebo for a period of 4 weeks. Hemodynamic parameters including heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac output were measured at baseline and at the end of the treatment period. Results showed no significant changes in heart rate, blood pressure, or cardiac output in either the H2-receptor antagonist group or the placebo group. These findings suggest that H2-receptor antagonists do not have significant hemodynamic effects in patients with GERD.",1

"Analysis of side-effects of medium- and low-dose cyclosporin maintenance therapy in psoriasis.  The side-effects of long-term cyclosporin A (CyA) treatment in 26 patients with severe psoriasis were evaluated. The patients were divided into two groups based on the daily dosage of CyA: medium-dose group (3-5 mg/kg/day) and low-dose group (1-<3 mg/kg/day). Common side-effects, including hypertension, renal dysfunction, hepatic dysfunction, hypertrichosis, and gingival hyperplasia, were monitored throughout the treatment period. The results showed that both groups experienced side-effects, but the medium-dose group had a higher incidence and severity of adverse reactions compared to the low-dose group. Hypertension was the most common side-effect observed in both groups, followed by renal dysfunction. However, the incidence of renal dysfunction was significantly higher in the medium-dose group. Other side-effects showed no significant differences between the two groups. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using CyA as a maintenance therapy for psoriasis, particularly in higher doses, as it may increase the risk of adverse reactions, especially renal dysfunction.

"Survivorship analysis of total knee arthroplasty. Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a common surgical intervention for end-stage knee osteoarthritis. While the procedure has been shown to provide significant pain relief and improve function in patients, long-term survivorship of TKA remains a topic of interest. In this study, we aimed to analyze the survivorship of TKAs in a cohort of patients over a 10-year period. The medical records of 500 patients who underwent primary TKA were retrospectively reviewed. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate the survivorship of TKAs, defined as the time from surgery to the need for revision or removal of the prosthesis. The overall survivorship rate at 10 years was found to be 90%. Factors associated with decreased survivorship included younger age, male gender, and the presence of comorbidities such as diabetes and obesity. Our results highlight the importance of patient selection and careful consideration of risk factors in determining the long-term success of TKA.",1
"The effect of dopexamine HCl upon collateral perfusion of the acutely ischemic myocardium in anesthetized dogs. Collateral perfusion of the ischemic myocardium is an important mechanism for maintaining tissue viability during acute ischemia. Enhancing collateral circulation may improve myocardial perfusion and reduce the extent of ischemic injury. Dopexamine HCl, a synthetic catecholamine with predominantly β2-adrenergic agonist activity, has been proposed as a potential therapeutic agent to augment collateral perfusion. In this study, anesthetized dogs were subjected to acute myocardial ischemia and treated with either dopexamine HCl or saline control. Collateral perfusion was assessed using microspheres. Results showed a significant increase in collateral flow in the dopexamine-treated group compared to the control group, indicating a potential role for dopexamine HCl in promoting collateral circulation during acute myocardial ischemia. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and assess the clinical implications of this finding.",1
"Visual illusions in a patient with lateral medullary syndrome. Lateral medullary syndrome, also known as Wallenberg syndrome, is a neurological condition characterized by a variety of sensory and motor deficits due to a lesion in the lateral medulla. Visual disturbances are not commonly associated with this syndrome; however, we present a case of a patient with lateral medullary syndrome who experienced visual illusions. The patient reported visual phenomena such as objects appearing closer or farther away than they actually were, as well as distortions in shape and size. These visual illusions were not associated with any organic ocular pathology or optic nerve dysfunction. It is hypothesized that the visual illusions observed in this patient may be a result of disruption or dysfunction in the posterior visual pathway due to the lesion in the lateral medulla. Further research and investigations are warranted to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these visual manifestations in lateral medullary syndrome.",1
"Low dose amitriptyline in chronic pain: the gain is modest.  In the double-blind placebo-controlled study presented here, the effects were investigated of a low dose of amitriptyline (75 mg) in patients with chronic pain of various origins. The study aimed to assess the efficacy of a low dose of amitriptyline (75 mg) in treating chronic pain of different etiologies. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either amitriptyline or placebo for a duration of 8 weeks. Outcome measures included pain intensity, sleep quality, and overall improvement in pain symptoms. 

Results indicated that the use of low dose amitriptyline yielded only modest gains in pain relief. Although there was a statistically significant reduction in pain intensity compared to placebo, the clinical significance of the reduction was limited. Additionally, no significant improvement in sleep quality or overall pain symptoms was observed in the amitriptyline group. 

Overall, while low dose amitriptyline demonstrated some analgesic effects, its efficacy in chronic pain management appeared to be modest at best. Further research exploring alternative treatment options may be warranted.",1

These findings provide insights into potential therapeutic strategies for improving skeletal muscle dysfunction in chronic heart failure.",1
"Retroviral recombination and reverse transcription. Retroviruses are unique RNA viruses that have the ability to convert their RNA genomes into DNA through the process of reverse transcription. This allows them to integrate their genetic information into the host cell's DNA, leading to long-term and often lifelong infection. Retroviral recombination is a crucial mechanism by which genetic diversity is generated within the retroviral population. This process involves the exchange of genetic material between two different retroviruses during coinfection. Recombination can result in the formation of novel viruses with unique genetic signatures, potentially leading to altered virulence, drug resistance, or escape from host immune responses. Understanding the mechanisms and implications of retroviral recombination is essential for the development of effective antiretroviral therapies and vaccines. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge on retroviral recombination and its role in virus evolution and pathogenesis. We also highlight recent advances in the field and potential therapeutic implications.",1

"Rupture of atheromatous plaque as a cause of thrombotic occlusion of stenotic internal carotid artery. Thrombotic occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) is commonly caused by atherosclerotic disease. However, the mechanism leading to plaque rupture and subsequent formation of thrombus remains poorly understood. We present a case of a 62-year-old male who suffered a cerebral infarction secondary to thrombotic occlusion of a stenotic ICA. Pathological examination revealed rupture of an atheromatous plaque at the site of occlusion, with a large thrombus filling the lumen. This highlights plaque rupture as a potential cause of thrombotic occlusion in stenotic ICAs. We reviewed the literature and identified similar cases, supporting the role of plaque rupture in thrombus formation. The findings suggest that targeting plaque stability and preventing rupture may provide an effective strategy for preventing thrombotic occlusion in patients with stenotic ICAs. Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and develop targeted therapies.",1
"Chronic hyperglycemia increases the density of glucose transporters in human erythrocyte membranes.  We investigated the effect of chronic hyperglycemia on glucose transporters in erythrocytes of subjects with and without diabetes mellitus. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of chronic hyperglycemia on the density of glucose transporters in erythrocyte membranes in individuals with and without diabetes mellitus. Erythrocyte samples were collected from subjects with diabetes mellitus and non-diabetic controls, and the density of glucose transporters was measured using immunoblotting techniques. It was observed that chronic hyperglycemia resulted in a significant increase in the density of glucose transporters in erythrocyte membranes in both groups. However, the increase was more pronounced in subjects with diabetes mellitus compared to non-diabetic controls. These findings suggest that chronic hyperglycemia plays a role in modulating glucose transporters in erythrocytes, which may have implications for glucose homeostasis and diabetes management.",1
"The management of mid-face fractures with intracranial injury.  Recent advances have radically changed the management of facial fractures. This article discusses the management of mid-face fractures with associated intracranial injury. Over the past few decades, advancements in surgical techniques and technologies have significantly improved outcomes for patients with these complex fractures. Traditionally, the treatment approach for mid-face fractures involved an open reduction and internal fixation, which often necessitated large surgical incisions and prolonged hospital stays. However, with the advent of minimally invasive techniques, such as endoscopy and the use of rigid fixation systems, surgeons can now achieve excellent results with reduced morbidity and shorter hospital stays. In cases where a mid-face fracture is accompanied by intracranial injury, the management becomes even more challenging. Close collaboration between maxillofacial surgeons and neurosurgeons is crucial to ensure optimal outcomes. This article reviews the current literature on the management of mid-face fractures with intracranial injury and highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach for these complex cases. Additionally, it discusses the potential complications and long-term sequelae associated with these injuries. Overall, the advancements in the management of mid-face fractures have significantly improved patient outcomes and have led to a shift towards less invasive procedures. However, further research is needed to optimize treatment strategies and minimize complications in this patient population.",1
"Identification of transforming growth factor beta family members present in bone-inductive protein purified from bovine bone. Bone-inductive protein (BIP) isolated from bovine bone is known to stimulate bone formation. However, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying its osteoinductive properties remain unclear. In this study, purified BIP was analyzed for the presence of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) family members, which are known regulators of bone remodeling. Using immunoblotting and mass spectrometry techniques, we identified the presence of TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and TGF-β3 in BIP preparations. Furthermore, the bioactivity of these TGF-β isoforms was confirmed through their ability to induce osteoblastic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells in vitro. This discovery provides valuable insights into the potential mechanisms by which BIP promotes bone formation and highlights the potential therapeutic applications of TGF-β family members in bone regeneration.",1

Fifty-two patients with unclippable aneurysms underwent endovascular occlusion using detachable coils and liquid embolic agents. Aneurysm occlusion was achieved in 98% of cases, with no immediate procedure-related complications. Follow-up angiography showed complete occlusion in 88% of patients. Neurological complications occurred in 6% of cases, but were reversible in all instances. Despite the high rate of complete occlusion, post-procedural ischemic events were observed in 12% of patients, highlighting the need for careful patient selection and follow-up. Endovascular occlusion of vertebral arteries appears to be a viable treatment option for unclippable vertebrobasilar aneurysms, offering a high rate of occlusion with acceptable complication rates.",1
"Oral contraceptives and breast cancer. The association between the use of oral contraceptives and the risk of breast cancer has been a topic of considerable interest and debate. Numerous studies have examined this potential relationship, but the findings have been inconsistent. Some studies have suggested that oral contraceptive use may slightly increase the risk of breast cancer, especially among long-term users or those who started using oral contraceptives at a young age. However, other studies have found no significant association or even a reduced risk of breast cancer in oral contraceptive users.

This literature review aims to provide an overview of the current evidence on the association between oral contraceptive use and breast cancer risk. It explores the different study designs, including cohort and case-control studies, and summarizes their findings. The potential mechanisms underlying this relationship, such as the hormonal effects of oral contraceptives, are also discussed. The limitations of the studies and the need for further research are highlighted. Overall, while some studies suggest a modest increase in breast cancer risk with oral contraceptive use, the evidence remains inconclusive, and individual risk factors should be considered when making contraceptive decisions.",1
"Abscess of the sphenoid sinus after transsphenoidal surgery. We present a case of a 38-year-old male who developed an abscess of the sphenoid sinus following transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenoma resection. The patient initially presented with persistent headache, fever, and nasal discharge two weeks after the surgery. Imaging studies revealed the presence of a sphenoid sinus abscess. The patient underwent endoscopic sinus surgery for abscess drainage and was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Cultures obtained from the abscess fluid grew Streptococcus pneumoniae. The patient showed significant improvement after the surgical intervention and antibiotic therapy. Abscess formation in the sphenoid sinus is a rare complication after transsphenoidal surgery, usually occurring due to direct contamination from the surgical site. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate management, including appropriate surgical intervention and antibiotic therapy, are crucial for successful treatment of this complication. Awareness of this potential complication is important in the postoperative care of patients undergoing transsphenoidal surgery.",1
"The pathology of heart allograft rejection. Heart transplantation is a viable treatment option for end-stage heart failure patients. However, the long-term success of heart transplantation is limited by the development of heart allograft rejection. The pathology of heart allograft rejection involves a complex interplay between the recipient's immune system and the donor heart. This process can be classified into three main types: hyperacute rejection, acute cellular rejection, and chronic rejection. 

Hyperacute rejection occurs within minutes to hours after transplantation and is mediated by preformed antibodies targeting the donor heart. Acute cellular rejection, which typically occurs within the first year post-transplant, involves T-cell infiltration and activation resulting in myocardial damage. Chronic rejection is characterized by progressive fibrosis and vascular remodeling leading to transplant vasculopathy. 

Rejection episodes are diagnosed through endomyocardial biopsies and assessed using the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) grading system. Treatment strategies for heart allograft rejection include immunosuppressive therapy, which aims to suppress the recipient's immune system and prevent further damage to the graft. Despite advances in immunosuppression, rejection remains a significant challenge in heart transplantation, emphasizing the need for further research to improve understanding and management of heart allograft rejection.",1
"Cerebral blood flow in progressive aphasia without dementia. Progressive aphasia is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the gradual loss of language abilities. Previous studies have shown that individuals with progressive aphasia often have decreased cerebral blood flow in specific language-related brain regions. However, the relationship between cerebral blood flow and cognitive impairment in progressive aphasia without dementia remains unclear. 

In this study, we utilized arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging to measure cerebral blood flow in a cohort of individuals with progressive aphasia but without dementia. We compared their cerebral blood flow patterns to those of healthy controls matched for age and sex. 

Our results revealed significant reductions in cerebral blood flow in language-related brain regions, including the left inferior frontal gyrus and left superior temporal gyrus, in individuals with progressive aphasia compared to controls. Importantly, these reductions in cerebral blood flow were associated with impaired language abilities, such as decreased fluency and word-finding difficulties. 

These findings suggest that cerebral blood flow alterations contribute to the language deficits observed in progressive aphasia without dementia. Further studies are needed to explore the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic implications of targeting cerebral blood flow in this population.",1

The mean age of the patients was 35 years, and the majority were male (68%). The most common location of the abscesses was the ileocecal region (59%), followed by the small bowel (23%) and colon (18%). Most patients presented with symptoms such as abdominal pain, fever, and leukocytosis. Initial management involved percutaneous or surgical drainage, followed by appropriate antibiotic therapy. Patients had a mean hospital stay of 10 days and a favorable clinical outcome, with resolution of the abscess and symptom improvement. In conclusion, management of intra-abdominal abscesses in Crohn's disease requires a multidisciplinary approach focusing on drainage and appropriate antibiotic therapy.",1
"Systemic mast cell disease associated with primary mediastinal germ cell tumor. We report a rare case of systemic mast cell disease (SMCD) associated with a primary mediastinal germ cell tumor (PMGCT). A 32-year-old male presented with symptoms of dizziness, shortness of breath, and chest pain. Imaging revealed a large anterior mediastinal mass. Histopathological examination confirmed a pure seminoma and concomitant mast cell infiltrates. Further evaluation revealed elevated serum tryptase levels and increased mast cell counts in the bone marrow, consistent with SMCD. Treatment consisted of surgical resection of the PMGCT followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. The patient's symptoms improved significantly postoperatively, and serum tryptase levels normalized. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of SMCD associated with a PMGCT, suggesting a potential association between these two rare clinical entities. Clinicians should consider investigating for SMCD in patients with mediastinal tumors presenting with mast cell infiltrates.

"Variations on the temporoparietal fascial flap. The temporoparietal fascial flap is a commonly used technique for reconstructing defects in the head and neck region. However, variations in the anatomy and vascular supply of the flap can pose challenges during surgical planning and execution. In this retrospective study, the authors describe five variations of the temporoparietal fascial flap that were encountered in their clinical practice. These variations include differences in the course and caliber of the temporal artery and vein, variations in the size and shape of the fascial flap, and presence of aberrant vessels within the flap. The authors discuss the implications of these variations in flap design and vascular anastomosis, as well as the strategies employed to overcome these challenges. Understanding and recognizing these variations is crucial for successful reconstruction using the temporoparietal fascial flap and can help avoid potential complications during surgery.",1
"Features of ""near-death experience"" in relation to whether or not patients were near death The medical records of 58 patients, most of whom believed they were near death during an illness or after an injury and all of whom later remembered unusual experiences occurring at the time, were examined. This study aimed to investigate the features of near-death experiences (NDEs) in relation to whether or not patients were actually near death. Medical records of 58 patients who reported NDEs were analyzed. Results showed that 38 patients were near death at the time of NDEs, while 20 patients were not near death. Common features of NDEs, such as the sensation of leaving the body, feelings of peace and joy, encountering deceased loved ones, and moving through a tunnel, were reported by both groups. However, patients who were near death reported more intense and vivid experiences compared to those who were not near death. This suggests that the intensity of NDEs may be influenced by the proximity to death.",1

"Fetal alcohol syndrome in adolescents and adults.  Fetal alcohol syndrome is a specific recognizable pattern of malformation. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a well-documented condition characterized by a range of physical, developmental, and behavioral abnormalities resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure. While FAS is typically identified during childhood, it is now increasingly recognized that these individuals continue to face complex challenges into adolescence and adulthood. This abstract highlights the importance of understanding the presentation, diagnosis, and management of FAS in older age groups. The physical manifestations of FAS, such as growth deficiency, dysmorphic facial features, and organ dysfunction, may persist. Neurodevelopmental impairments, including cognitive deficits, learning disabilities, and behavioral problems, can also have a significant impact on academic and social functioning. As individuals with FAS transition into adulthood, they may experience difficulties with effective communication, social relationships, and independent living skills. This abstract emphasizes the need for comprehensive, interdisciplinary care adapted to the unique needs of adolescents and adults with FAS to optimize their functional outcomes and quality of life.",1
"Colorectal adenocarcinoma in patients less than 40 years of age.  From 1973 to 1985, 105 patients under 40 years of age were treated for colorectal adenocarcinoma at Roswell Park Cancer Institute. Colorectal adenocarcinoma is typically rare in patients under 40 years of age. This study aimed to analyze the clinical characteristics and outcomes of 105 young patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma treated at Roswell Park Cancer Institute from 1973 to 1985. The majority of patients presented with advanced stage disease, with 77% having lymph node involvement and 20% demonstrating distant metastases at the time of diagnosis. Younger patients were more likely to have a family history of colorectal cancer compared to older patients.

Further studies are needed to understand the underlying factors contributing to the development of colorectal adenocarcinoma in young patients and to identify optimal treatment strategies for this unique patient population.",1
"Specificity of affective and autonomic symptoms of depression in Parkinson's disease. Depression is a common comorbidity in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), but the specificity of affective and autonomic symptoms in this population remains unclear. This study aimed to assess the specificity of these symptoms in patients with PD by comparing them to patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) without PD. 

Thirty-six patients with PD and depression, 36 patients with MDD without PD, and 36 healthy controls were included. All participants completed self-report questionnaires measuring depressive symptoms and autonomic function. 

Results showed that patients with PD and depression exhibited significantly higher levels of somatic and autonomic symptoms compared to both patients with MDD without PD and healthy controls. Additionally, patients with PD and depression reported higher levels of motor symptoms compared to patients with MDD without PD. 

These findings suggest that the affective and autonomic symptoms of depression in PD may be more specific to the disease, potentially reflecting underlying neurobiological mechanisms related to dopaminergic dysfunction and autonomic dysregulation. Further research is needed to explore the implications of these findings for the diagnosis and management of depression in PD.",1
"Late recurrence of varus deformity after proximal tibial osteotomy.  One hundred thirteen knees with medial gonarthrosis in 95 patients were treated by valgus-producing proximal tibial osteotomy and followed clinically and roentgenographically for a minimum of five years (mean, 6. During the follow-up period, 9 knees (8%) developed a late recurrence of varus deformity after proximal tibial osteotomy. The mean time to recurrence was 42 months. These knees showed a gradual progression of varus alignment over time. The recurrence of varus deformity was more common in younger patients and those with a higher preoperative varus angle. However, there was no significant difference in the recurrence rate based on the type of osteotomy or the presence of preoperative joint space narrowing.

"Parathyroid hormone-like peptide in normal and neoplastic mesothelial cells. Parathyroid hormone-like peptide (PTHrP) is a crucial regulator of calcium metabolism and plays a role in various physiological and pathological processes. This study aimed to investigate the expression and function of PTHrP in normal and neoplastic mesothelial cells. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that PTHrP was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm of both normal and neoplastic mesothelial cells. Furthermore, PTHrP expression was significantly higher in neoplastic mesothelial cells compared to normal cells. Functionally, PTHrP overexpression in neoplastic mesothelial cells led to increased cell proliferation and migration. Additionally, PTHrP knockdown in normal mesothelial cells resulted in impaired cell proliferation and migration. These findings suggest that PTHrP may contribute to the development and progression of mesothelial cell neoplasms through its effects on cell proliferation and migration. Further investigation of PTHrP signaling pathways may provide insights into potential therapeutic targets for mesothelioma.",1

Computed tomographic (CT) guided drainage has emerged as a minimally invasive and effective technique for accessing these abscesses. This study aimed to provide an objective appraisal of the role of CT-guided drainage in the management of intra-abdominal abscesses.

A retrospective analysis was conducted on a cohort of patients who underwent CT-guided drainage for intra-abdominal abscesses. The efficacy of the procedure, in terms of abscess resolution, was assessed along with any complications or adverse events associated with the technique.

Preliminary findings suggest that CT-guided drainage is a safe and effective method for the management of intra-abdominal abscesses. The procedure demonstrated high success rates in abscess resolution, with minimal complications reported. Further investigations are warranted to validate these findings and explore potential refinements in the technique to optimize patient outcomes.",1
"Development of language in six hemispherectomized patients. Hemispherectomy, the surgical removal or disconnection of one cerebral hemisphere, is a treatment option for severe epilepsy or brain tumors. This study aimed to investigate the language development in six patients who underwent hemispherectomy. The patients' language abilities were assessed preoperatively and at various postoperative time points using standardized language tests. Results showed that all patients demonstrated some degree of language recovery after hemispherectomy, although the extent and rate of recovery varied among individuals. Both expressive and receptive language skills improved over time, with some patients achieving near-normal language abilities. Factors such as age at surgery, etiology of the underlying condition, and presence of preoperative language deficits influenced language outcomes. These findings highlight the plasticity of the brain and suggest that language recovery can occur even after extensive surgical resections.",1
"Veterans Administration Cooperative Study Group on Hypertensive Agents: effects of age on treatment results. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of age on treatment results in the context of hypertension using data from the Veterans Administration Cooperative Study Group on Hypertensive Agents. A total of 2,500 patients with hypertension were included in this analysis, with ages ranging from 40 to 80 years. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either active or placebo treatment. The primary outcomes assessed were changes in blood pressure levels and the occurrence of adverse events. Subgroup analysis was performed based on age categories (40-59 years, 60-69 years, and 70-80 years) to investigate potential differences in treatment response. The results showed that age did not significantly impact the effectiveness of hypertension treatment. Furthermore, there were no significant age-related differences in the occurrence of adverse events. These findings suggest that age should not be a major consideration when selecting treatment options for hypertensive patients.",1
"Lower extremity revascularization via the lateral plantar artery. Lower extremity revascularization is a common procedure in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) to restore blood flow and alleviate symptoms such as claudication and critical limb ischemia. The traditional approach involves using larger vessels, such as the femoral artery, for grafting or bypass procedures. However, in some cases, these vessels may not be suitable or accessible for revascularization. We present a case of successful lower extremity revascularization via the lateral plantar artery in a patient with severe PAD who had previously undergone multiple failed revascularization attempts. The procedure involved the use of a small diameter graft to connect the lateral plantar artery to the distal popliteal artery, allowing for reestablishment of blood flow to the affected limb. This case highlights the potential of the lateral plantar artery as an alternative option for lower extremity revascularization when traditional techniques are not feasible. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the long-term outcomes and effectiveness of this approach.",1
"The J-curve phenomenon and the treatment of hypertension. The J-curve phenomenon describes a U-shaped relationship between blood pressure and cardiovascular outcomes, showing that both low and high blood pressures are associated with increased risk. In this study, we investigated the impact of this phenomenon on the treatment of hypertension. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effects of blood pressure lowering therapy on cardiovascular outcomes in hypertensive patients.

Our analysis revealed that aggressive blood pressure lowering below a certain threshold was associated with increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events, particularly in patients with diabetes or pre-existing coronary artery disease. This suggests that overly aggressive treatment of hypertension may lead to harm, emphasizing the importance of individualized treatment goals and careful consideration of blood pressure targets in high-risk patients.

Furthermore, our findings highlight the need for further research to identify the optimal blood pressure range for different patient populations, as well as the development of personalized treatment strategies. In conclusion, a one-size-fits-all approach to hypertension management may not be appropriate, and treatment decisions should be guided by a balanced consideration of both the benefits and risks associated with blood pressure lowering therapy.",1
"Direct visualization of ruptured chordae tendineae by transesophageal two-dimensional echocardiography. Transesophageal two-dimensional echocardiography (TEE) is a valuable diagnostic tool for assessing valvular pathology, including ruptured chordae tendineae (RCT). This case study presents three cases of RCT that were visualized directly using TEE. In all cases, TEE provided excellent visualization of the mitral valve apparatus, allowing for identification and localization of the RCT. The images obtained clearly demonstrated the ruptured chordae tendineae as well as associated complications such as mitral regurgitation and flail leaflet. TEE also provided detailed information about the extent and severity of the valvular pathology, guiding subsequent surgical interventions. The use of TEE in these cases highlights its efficacy in diagnosing RCT and guiding management decisions. This case series emphasizes the importance of considering TEE as an early diagnostic modality when evaluating patients with suspected valvular pathology, particularly in cases where conventional transthoracic echocardiography may be limited or inconclusive. Further research is warranted to explore the role of TEE in the evaluation of valvular diseases and to assess its impact on patient outcomes.",1
"Evolution of the continuity equation in the Doppler echocardiographic assessment of the severity of valvular aortic stenosis. The evaluation and grading of valvular aortic stenosis severity is crucial for appropriate management and treatment decisions. This study aimed to investigate the evolution of the continuity equation in Doppler echocardiographic assessment of valvular aortic stenosis severity. A total of 97 patients with varying degrees of aortic stenosis were included in this retrospective study. Doppler echocardiographic data, including peak and mean transvalvular gradients and aortic valve area (AVA), were collected. The continuity equation was used to calculate AVA in each patient. The results showed that there was a significant correlation between AVA calculated using the continuity equation and AVA measured directly from surgical specimens (r=0.82, p<0.001). Additionally, there was good agreement between the two methods in categorizing the severity of aortic stenosis (kappa=0.77, p<0.001). However, the continuity equation tended to underestimate AVA in patients with severe aortic stenosis. In conclusion, the continuity equation is a reliable tool for assessing aortic valve area in patients with valvular aortic stenosis, but caution should be exercised when evaluating severe cases to avoid underestimation of severity.",1
"Calcium channel blockers versus angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors: renal effects. Calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) are commonly prescribed medications for the management of hypertension and several other cardiovascular conditions. While both classes of drugs are known to exert beneficial effects on blood pressure control and cardiovascular outcomes, their specific effects on renal function and structure have not been extensively compared. In this review, we aim to compare the renal effects of calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors.

Clinical studies have shown that ACE inhibitors can reduce proteinuria and slow the progression of chronic kidney disease, mainly through their ability to selectively inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. In contrast, calcium channel blockers have been associated with variable effects on proteinuria and renal outcomes. Some studies suggest a potential renoprotective effect, while others show a neutral or even detrimental effect on renal function.

Mechanistically, ACE inhibitors inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, thereby decreasing vasoconstriction and proteinuria. Calcium channel blockers, on the other hand, exert their effects by relaxing vascular smooth muscle and improving renal blood flow. However, the exact mechanisms underlying their renal effects remain largely unknown.

Further research is warranted to fully understand the differential renal effects of these two drug classes and to identify patient characteristics that may influence treatment response. This knowledge could help clinicians in making informed decisions regarding optimal antihypertensive therapy in patients with renal impairment.",1
"Intraoperative dexamethasone irrigation in lumbar microdiskectomy.  In 45 lumbar hemilaminectomy/microdiskectomy patients, a control group of 23 patients had the standard operative procedure. The other 22 patients received an intraoperative irrigation of dexamethasone solution into the surgical site. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of intraoperative dexamethasone irrigation on postoperative pain and functional outcomes in patients undergoing lumbar microdiskectomy. Pain scores, medication usage, and functional outcomes were assessed at postoperative days 1, 7, and 30. The group that received dexamethasone irrigation exhibited significantly lower pain scores at all time points compared to the control group. Additionally, they required less postoperative pain medication and demonstrated better functional outcomes. These findings suggest that intraoperative dexamethasone irrigation may be an effective adjunct in reducing postoperative pain and improving functional outcomes in patients undergoing lumbar microdiskectomy. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the long-term effects and potential side effects of this intervention.",1

"Surgery for sinusitis and aspirin triad.  An 11-year retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the surgical treatment of sinusitis in aspirin-triad patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of surgical treatment for sinusitis in patients with aspirin triad, which includes asthma, nasal polyposis, and sensitivity to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin. A total of 50 patients who underwent surgical intervention for chronic sinusitis between 2009 and 2020 were included in this retrospective study. The surgical procedures performed included functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) and polypectomy. The patients were assessed preoperatively and postoperatively for symptom relief, recurrence of sinusitis, and need for revision surgery. The results showed that surgical treatment led to significant improvement in symptoms and reduction in the frequency of sinusitis episodes. The recurrence rate of sinusitis was found to be low, and only a small proportion of patients required revision surgery. This study suggests that surgical intervention is an effective treatment option for sinusitis in patients with aspirin triad, providing long-term symptom relief and minimal recurrence.",1
"RAR-alpha gene rearrangements as a genetic marker for diagnosis and monitoring in acute promyelocytic leukemia. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a distinct subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) characterized by the presence of the t(15;17) translocation, resulting in the fusion of the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene on chromosome 15 with the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR-alpha) gene on chromosome 17. This leads to the formation of the PML-RAR-alpha fusion protein, which plays a crucial role in leukemogenesis. The detection of RAR-alpha gene rearrangements is essential for the diagnosis and monitoring of APL. In this review, we discuss the various laboratory techniques used for the detection of RAR-alpha gene rearrangements, including fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Additionally, we highlight the clinical significance of RAR-alpha gene rearrangements as a genetic marker for prognostication, minimal residual disease detection, and targeted therapy in APL. Overall, understanding the role of RAR-alpha gene rearrangements in APL is crucial for improved diagnosis, monitoring, and management of this distinct leukemia subtype.",1
"Relationship of laparoscopic findings to self-report of pelvic pain. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between laparoscopic findings and self-report of pelvic pain in women. A total of 120 women with chronic pelvic pain were included in the study. Laparoscopic examination was performed to identify any abnormal findings in the pelvis, such as adhesions, endometriosis, or ovarian cysts. Additionally, participants were asked to complete a questionnaire assessing the severity and frequency of their pelvic pain. 

The results showed that there was a significant association between laparoscopic findings and self-report of pelvic pain. Women with abnormal laparoscopic findings were more likely to report higher levels of pain intensity and frequency compared to those with normal laparoscopic findings. Specifically, the presence of endometriosis or adhesions was associated with a higher likelihood of reporting severe and frequent pelvic pain.

These findings suggest that laparoscopic examination is an important diagnostic tool for identifying the underlying causes of pelvic pain in women. It highlights the need for a comprehensive evaluation of pelvic pain, including both subjective self-report and objective laparoscopic findings, to guide appropriate management and treatment decisions.",1
"Synergistic effects of psyllium in the dietary treatment of hypercholesterolemia.  We investigated psyllium fiber supplementation as a means of enhancing the cholesterol-lowering effect of the phase I American Heart Association diet.  Fifty-nine subjects with total serum cholesterol (TC) levels ranging from 5. Psyllium fiber supplementation has been shown to have synergistic effects in the dietary treatment of hypercholesterolemia. A study was conducted on 59 subjects with varying levels of total serum cholesterol (TC) to investigate the efficacy of psyllium fiber in enhancing the cholesterol-lowering effect of the phase I American Heart Association diet. The subjects were divided into two groups, with one group receiving the diet alone and the other group receiving the diet supplemented with psyllium fiber. After the intervention period, it was observed that the group receiving psyllium fiber supplementation exhibited a significantly greater reduction in TC levels compared to the group receiving the diet alone. Furthermore, there was a significant decrease in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels in the psyllium fiber supplemented group. These findings suggest that psyllium fiber supplementation can provide an effective and complementary approach to the dietary treatment of hypercholesterolemia, leading to improved cholesterol management and cardiovascular health.",1
"Randomised single blind trial to compare the toxicity of subconjunctival gentamicin and cefuroxime in cataract surgery.  Comparatively little attention has been paid to the conjunctival toxicity of antibiotics administered at the time of cataract surgery. This randomized, single-blind trial aimed to compare the conjunctival toxicity of subconjunctival gentamicin and cefuroxime in patients undergoing cataract surgery. Previous studies have primarily focused on the efficacy of antibiotics, neglecting their potential adverse effects on the conjunctiva. A total of 100 patients were included and randomly assigned to receive either subconjunctival gentamicin or cefuroxime during surgery. Conjunctival toxicity was assessed postoperatively using a standardized grading system. The results showed that subconjunctival gentamicin had a significantly higher incidence of conjunctival toxicity compared to cefuroxime. These findings emphasize the importance of considering the potential side effects of antibiotics used in cataract surgery, and suggest that cefuroxime may be a safer alternative to gentamicin in terms of conjunctival toxicity. Further research is warranted to validate these results and evaluate the long-term effects of these antibiotics on ocular health.",1
"Extracapsular cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation after scleral buckling surgery.  We reviewed the records of 28 patients who had undergone successful scleral buckling surgery followed by extracapsular cataract extraction with implantation of an intraocular lens. We present a retrospective study of 28 patients who underwent extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation following successful scleral buckling surgery for retinal detachment. The mean age of the patients was 64 years, with a range of 52 to 76 years. The surgeries were performed between 2015 and 2018. Visual acuity outcomes and postoperative complications were analyzed. The mean preoperative visual acuity was 0.4 logMAR (Snellen equivalent of approximately 20/50), which significantly improved to 0.2 logMAR (Snellen equivalent of approximately 20/32) postoperatively. The most common complication was transient elevated intraocular pressure, occurring in 5 patients (17.9%). Overall, ECCE with IOL implantation proved to be a safe and effective procedure for restoring vision in patients who had previously undergone successful scleral buckling surgery.",1
"Effect of hydrocephalus on prostaglandins and thromboxane B2 in ventricular cerebrospinal fluid. The impact of hydrocephalus on prostaglandins and thromboxane B2 in ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was examined in a study involving 20 patients with hydrocephalus and 10 control subjects. CSF samples were collected from the lateral ventricles during ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery or lumbar puncture from the control group. Levels of prostaglandins E2, F2α, and thromboxane B2 were measured using enzyme immunoassays. 

Results revealed significantly higher levels of prostaglandin E2, F2α, and thromboxane B2 in the CSF of hydrocephalus patients compared to controls, indicating an increased inflammatory response and abnormal coagulation profile.

Furthermore, the severity of hydrocephalus, as assessed by ventricular size on MRI, correlated positively with the levels of prostaglandins and thromboxane B2. These findings suggest that hydrocephalus leads to a dysregulated inflammatory and coagulation response within the ventricular CSF, potentially contributing to the pathophysiology of this condition. Further studies are warranted to investigate the therapeutic implications of modulating prostaglandin and thromboxane levels in hydrocephalus management.",1
"Effect of prednisolone treatment in chronic silicosis. Silicosis is a chronic lung disease caused by inhalation of crystalline silica particles. Treatment options for this condition are limited, and there is still a need for effective therapies. In this study, the effect of prednisolone treatment in chronic silicosis was evaluated. Twenty-five patients with confirmed silicosis were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either prednisolone or placebo for a period of six months. Pulmonary function tests, radiographic assessments, and symptom scores were used to assess treatment outcomes. The results showed that patients treated with prednisolone had a significant improvement in pulmonary function, with increased forced expiratory volume and forced vital capacity compared to the placebo group. Radiographic assessments also showed a reduction in lung opacities in the prednisolone-treated group. Additionally, symptom scores for cough and dyspnea were significantly reduced in the prednisolone group compared to placebo. These findings suggest that prednisolone treatment may have a beneficial effect on pulmonary function and symptoms in patients with chronic silicosis. Further studies are needed to confirm these results and determine the optimal dosing regimen for prednisolone in silicosis treatment.",1
"Total knee arthroplasty in obese patients.  We examined 182 patients (257 knees) who had had a total knee arthroplasty two to five six years earlier. We conducted a retrospective study to evaluate the outcomes of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in obese patients. A total of 182 patients (257 knees) who had undergone TKA between two and five years ago were included in the analysis. The patients were categorized into three groups based on body mass index (BMI): non-obese, overweight, and obese. Surgical outcomes, including range of motion (ROM), pain scores, and functional scores, were assessed at the time of follow-up. 
We found that obese patients had significantly poorer outcomes compared to non-obese and overweight individuals. Obese patients had lower ROM, higher pain scores, and lower functional scores. Additionally, the incidence of complications such as infection and implant loosening was higher in obese patients. Our findings suggest that obesity negatively impacts the long-term outcomes of TKA and emphasize the importance of weight management in this patient population. Further studies are warranted to explore interventions aimed at improving outcomes in obese patients undergoing TKA.",1
"Intravenous administration of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor causes a cutaneous eruption The intravenous administration of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor to three patients with leukemia who were receiving marrow aplasia-inducing chemotherapy resulted in the development of wide-spread erythematous macules and papules. The cutaneous eruption consisted of erythematous macules and papules that appeared within one to two days after initiation of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor therapy. The eruption was diffuse and symmetrical and involved the trunk, extremities, and face. The lesions were not pruritic and resolved spontaneously within three to four days after discontinuation of the therapy. The eruption suggested an immune-mediated drug reaction rather than a direct effect of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor itself. This case report highlights the importance of recognizing the potential adverse effects of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor therapy and the need for close monitoring of patients receiving this treatment.",1
"Evaluation of argon laser surgery in children under 13 years of age. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of argon laser surgery in children under 13 years of age.

"Cholinergic deficiency and frontal dysfunction in Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor symptoms such as tremors, bradykinesia, and rigidity. However, non-motor symptoms, including cognitive and psychiatric manifestations, are also prevalent in PD. This study aimed to investigate the association between cholinergic deficiency and frontal dysfunction in PD patients. A total of 120 PD patients and 60 healthy controls were included in the study. Cognitive and psychiatric assessments were performed using standardized tests, and cholinergic functions were evaluated through acetylcholinesterase activity measurements. The results revealed significantly lower acetylcholinesterase activity in PD patients compared to controls (p < 0.001). Furthermore, PD patients exhibited poorer performance in cognitive tests assessing frontal executive functions (p < 0.05) and higher frequencies of psychiatric symptoms (p < 0.001) compared to controls. The severity of cholinergic deficiency was positively correlated with the severity of frontal dysfunction (r = 0.416, p < 0.001) and the presence of psychiatric symptoms (r = 0.296, p < 0.01). These findings suggest that cholinergic deficiency may contribute to frontal dysfunction and psychiatric symptoms in PD, highlighting the potential role of cholinergic therapies in managing non-motor symptoms of PD.",1

"Relevance of focal cerebral ischemia models. Focal cerebral ischemia models are widely used in preclinical research to study the pathophysiology of stroke and develop novel therapeutic interventions. These models involve the deliberate induction of ischemia in a specific region of the brain, mimicking the conditions seen in patients with stroke. Different techniques and models have been developed to produce focal cerebral ischemia, including middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), photothrombosis, and embolic models.

The relevance of these models lies in their ability to replicate key features of human stroke, such as focal brain injury, ischemic penumbra, and subsequent neuronal death. By studying the mechanisms underlying ischemia-induced neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and blood-brain barrier disruption, researchers can gain insights into the complex cascade of events occurring after stroke.

Furthermore, focal cerebral ischemia models allow for the evaluation of potential therapeutic strategies, including neuroprotective agents, stem cell therapies, and innovative approaches such as gene therapy and neurostimulation. The use of animal models also enables the investigation of the temporal dynamics of ischemic injury and the development of imaging modalities for early diagnosis and monitoring of stroke progression.

In conclusion, focal cerebral ischemia models provide valuable tools for understanding the pathophysiology of stroke and developing effective treatments.

"Cystocerebral syndrome.  Acute urinary retention presenting as confusion in elderly patients. Cystocerebral syndrome refers to the association between acute urinary retention and cognitive impairment in elderly patients. It is a frequently overlooked condition that can present as confusion in this population. We present two cases of elderly patients who presented with acute confusion and were found to have urinary retention. Both patients had no previous history of cognitive impairment and were found to have significant improvement in their mental status after catheterization and relief of urinary retention. Both patients were diagnosed with cystocerebral syndrome based on the resolution of confusion following bladder decompression. This syndrome is likely due to the effect of elevated intravesical pressure on the cerebral blood flow, resulting in cognitive impairment. Cystocerebral syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute confusion in elderly patients, particularly if there are associated urinary symptoms. Early recognition and management of this condition can lead to prompt resolution of symptoms and improved outcomes.",1
"Predictors of physician nonadherence to chemotherapy regimens.  Physician nonadherence to cancer treatment regimens may diminish treatment efficacy and compromise clinical research. Understanding the factors that contribute to physician nonadherence to chemotherapy regimens is crucial for improving patient outcomes and ensuring the success of clinical trials. In this study, we aimed to identify predictors of physician nonadherence to chemotherapy regimens in a population of cancer patients. 

Data from 150 patients undergoing chemotherapy were analyzed. Nonadherence was defined as any deviation from the prescribed treatment plan, including dose reductions, delays, or early discontinuation. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify potential predictors of nonadherence. 

Our results revealed that younger age, higher patient comorbidity burden, and the presence of treatment-related toxicities were significant predictors of physician nonadherence. Additionally, lack of clear communication and understanding between physician and patient regarding treatment goals and potential side effects were associated with increased nonadherence. 

These findings highlight the importance of patient education and physician-patient communication in promoting treatment adherence. Strategies such as comprehensive patient counseling, regular follow-up, and close monitoring of treatment-related toxicities may help improve adherence rates and ultimately enhance treatment outcomes in cancer patients.

"Vitamin E in gastric mucosal injury induced by ischemia-reperfusion. Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) of the gastric mucosa is a common complication in various clinical conditions such as gastric surgery or acute gastric bleeding. The authors aimed to investigate the protective effects of vitamin E on gastric mucosal injury induced by IRI. In an experimental study using rats, ischemia was induced by occluding the celiac artery for 30 minutes followed by reperfusion for 60 minutes. The animals were divided into three groups: control, IRI, and vitamin E-treated IRI. Upon analysis, the IRI group showed severe gastric mucosal injury characterized by mucosal edema, hemorrhage, and leukocyte infiltration. Remarkably, the vitamin E-treated IRI group displayed significantly attenuated mucosal injury, with reduced edema, hemorrhage, and leukocyte infiltration. Furthermore, vitamin E treatment resulted in lower levels of oxidative stress markers and increased antioxidant enzyme activities. These findings suggest that vitamin E administration can effectively protect against gastric mucosal injury induced by IRI, potentially through its antioxidant properties. The results highlight the potential therapeutic application of vitamin E in preventing ischemia-reperfusion-associated gastric complications.",1

"Treatment of ventricular tachycardia induced cardiogenic shock by percoronary chemical ablation.  Incessant ventricular arrhythmias pose an especially challenging therapeutic dilemma. In this study, we present a case of ventricular tachycardia-induced cardiogenic shock successfully treated with percoronary chemical ablation. A 54-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy presented with incessant ventricular arrhythmias leading to severe hemodynamic compromise. Despite multiple attempts at electrical cardioversion and pharmacological antiarrhythmic therapy, the patient's condition continued to deteriorate. Percoronary chemical ablation was chosen as a potential salvage therapy due to the patient's high risk for surgical intervention. Under fluoroscopic guidance, ethanol infusion was performed through a microcatheter into the culprit coronary artery supplying the arrhythmogenic substrate. Immediate termination of ventricular arrhythmias was achieved, with subsequent hemodynamic stabilization. Follow-up electrophysiological studies confirmed the absence of inducible ventricular arrhythmias. The patient's clinical course remained stable without recurrence of arrhythmias during the 12-month follow-up period. Percoronary chemical ablation may serve as a valuable therapeutic option in cases of incessant ventricular arrhythmias refractory to conventional treatments, especially in patients with significant comorbidities or high surgical risk. Further research is warranted to establish the safety and efficacy of this technique in a larger patient population.",1

"Intravascular ultrasound: a new potential modality for angioplasty guidance. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is an emerging technology that has shown promise as a potential modality for guiding angioplasty procedures. This abstract aims to discuss the benefits and limitations of using IVUS during angioplasty, based on current literature.

IVUS allows for real-time visualization of the arterial wall and lumen, providing detailed information about plaque morphology, vessel dimensions, and stenosis severity. This enables more accurate assessment of lesion characteristics and determination of optimal balloon size and deployment strategy. IVUS also helps evaluate the immediate procedural results by assessing stent apposition, expansion, and potential complications such as dissection or thrombus formation.

Furthermore, IVUS can guide decision-making in complex lesions, such as calcified or eccentric plaques, where angiography alone may be insufficient. It may also aid in the treatment of bifurcation lesions, by evaluating side branch compromise and optimizing stent placement.

However, there are some limitations to IVUS. It requires additional equipment and expertise, which may increase procedural time and cost. There is also a learning curve associated with interpreting IVUS images accurately. Additionally, IVUS is not readily available in all centers, limiting its widespread use.

In conclusion, IVUS has the potential to improve the outcomes of angioplasty procedures by providing detailed intravascular imaging. Its ability to assess lesion characteristics, guide stent selection, and evaluate post-procedural results make it a valuable tool in the field of interventional cardiology. However, further research and advancements are needed to overcome its limitations and determine its true impact on clinical outcomes.",1

Driving ability in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) may be compromised due to the altered motor and mental skills associated with the condition. This abstract aims to explore the impact of PD on driving performance. Studies have shown that individuals with PD have impaired motor coordination, reduced reaction times, and difficulties with attention and decision-making, all of which are critical skills required for safe driving. These deficits have been found to worsen as the disease progresses. Furthermore, individuals with PD are more prone to experiencing freezing of gait episodes, which can be especially hazardous while operating a vehicle. Assessing the driving abilities and providing guidance to individuals with PD on whether to continue or restrict their driving privileges is crucial to ensure the safety of both the patient and the general public.",1

"Comparative yield of Salmonella typhi from blood and bone marrow cultures in patients with fever of unknown origin. Salmonella typhi is the causative agent of typhoid fever, a systemic infection characterized by fever of unknown origin. The diagnosis of typhoid fever is traditionally confirmed by the isolation of S. typhi from blood cultures. However, recent studies have suggested that bone marrow cultures may have a higher yield in detecting S. typhi. In this retrospective study, we compared the yield of S. typhi from blood and bone marrow cultures in patients with fever of unknown origin. Our findings demonstrate that bone marrow cultures have a significantly higher yield in detecting S. typhi compared to blood cultures. Therefore, we recommend considering bone marrow cultures as a diagnostic tool in patients with fever of unknown origin suspected of having typhoid fever.",1
"Systemic hypertension in sleep apnea syndrome. Sleep apnea syndrome is a common sleep disorder characterized by intermittent cessation of airflow during sleep. It is associated with various comorbidities, including systemic hypertension. This case report presents a 45-year-old male with a history of snoring and daytime sleepiness who was diagnosed with moderate obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Despite treatment with continuous positive airway pressure therapy, the patient continued to experience high blood pressure. Further evaluation revealed secondary causes of hypertension were unlikely. Polysomnography confirmed persistent obstructive sleep apnea, indicating that untreated or inadequately treated sleep apnea may contribute to the development or worsening of systemic hypertension. Therefore, clinicians should consider sleep apnea as a potential underlying cause in patients with hypertension resistant to conventional therapy.",1
"Measurement of resistance versus flow in assessing efficiency of aortocoronary bypass grafts.  Measurement of flow in saphenous bypass grafts with an electromagnetic flowmeter is complicated and poorly reproducible. This study aimed to assess the efficiency of aortocoronary bypass grafts by measuring resistance versus flow. A total of 60 patients who underwent aortocoronary bypass surgery were included in the study. Flow measurements in saphenous bypass grafts were done using an electromagnetic flowmeter. The results showed that measuring flow in saphenous bypass grafts was complicated and poorly reproducible due to various technical factors. However, resistance measurements were found to be more reliable and consistent in assessing graft efficiency. The study also identified a significant correlation between resistance measurements and graft patency, with higher resistance values indicating lower graft flow and potential graft failure. This finding suggests that resistance measurement may be a valuable tool in evaluating the functionality of aortocoronary bypass grafts. Further research is needed to validate these findings and explore alternative methods for assessing graft efficiency.",1

"Survival rates from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: recommendations for uniform definitions and data to report. Survival rates from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) vary widely among different studies due to differences in definitions and reporting. This lack of standardization hinders accurate comparison and interpretation of data. To address this issue, a group of experts convened to develop recommendations for uniform definitions and data reporting for OHCA survival rates. The recommendations include standardized definitions for key terms such as return of spontaneous circulation, survival to hospital admission, and survival to hospital discharge. In addition, the experts propose a set of core data elements that should be collected in all studies, including information on patient demographics, cardiac arrest characteristics, prehospital care, and post-resuscitation care. These recommendations aim to improve the consistency and quality of data on OHCA survival rates, allowing for better comparison and interpretation, and ultimately facilitating the development of evidence-based strategies to improve outcomes in patients with OHCA.",1

"Late cholangitis after successful surgical repair of biliary atresia.  Bacterial cholangitis is a frequent complication of successful surgical repair of biliary atresia, occurring in 93% of patients before the age of 1 year, but thought to be rare after 2 years of age. We report two cases of late cholangitis occurring in patients who underwent successful surgical repair of biliary atresia. Both cases presented with recurrent episodes of fever and abdominal pain, and were found to have evidence of cholestasis and elevated liver enzymes. Biliary imaging revealed strictures and dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts, consistent with cholangitis. Microbiological cultures from bile samples grew Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, confirming the diagnosis. Both patients were treated with parenteral antibiotics and underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with sphincterotomy and biliary stenting. Follow-up showed resolution of symptoms and improvement in liver function tests. These cases highlight the importance of considering late cholangitis as a potential complication in patients who have undergone surgical repair of biliary atresia, even beyond the age of 2 years. Furthermore, prompt recognition and appropriate management are crucial for preventing long-term complications and preserving liver function.",1
"Hyperplastic polyps seen at sigmoidoscopy are markers for additional adenomas seen at colonoscopy.  Asymptomatic individuals undergoing screening flexible sigmoidoscopy were prospectively studied. To determine the predictive value of hyperplastic polyps visualized during sigmoidoscopy in detecting additional adenomas, a prospective study was conducted in asymptomatic individuals undergoing screening flexible sigmoidoscopy. A total of 250 participants were included, and all hyperplastic polyps observed during sigmoidoscopy were confirmed histologically. Subsequently, these individuals underwent colonoscopy to assess the presence of additional adenomas. The findings revealed that 62 participants had at least one hyperplastic polyp, and among them, 73% were found to have additional adenomas during colonoscopy. In contrast, only 29% of individuals without hyperplastic polyps on sigmoidoscopy had additional adenomas on colonoscopy. This result suggests that the presence of hyperplastic polyps during sigmoidoscopy serves as a predictive marker for the likelihood of detecting additional adenomas during colonoscopy. Therefore, close surveillance and thorough evaluation are necessary for individuals with hyperplastic polyps to accurately detect and manage potential colorectal adenomas.",1

This abstract emphasizes the importance of interventional radiology in the comprehensive management of biliary tract disorders.",1
"Does age affect outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation? We examined the relation between age and outcomes in patients treated for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Seattle, Wash. A total of 458 patients who received out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) were included in this study. The patients were divided into three age groups: younger than 60, 60-79, and 80 years or older. The primary outcome measure was survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes measures included return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), 24-hour survival, and neurologic outcomes at discharge.

The results showed that older age was associated with lower rates of survival to hospital discharge (p < 0.001). Specifically, patients aged 60-79 years had a lower rate of survival compared to those younger than 60 years (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.41-0.97, p = 0.035), while patients aged 80 years or older had the lowest rate of survival (adjusted OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.12-0.38, p < 0.001).

Furthermore, older age was also associated with lower rates of ROSC (p < 0.001) and 24-hour survival (p < 0.001). Among survivors, older age was associated with poorer neurologic outcomes at discharge (p = 0.023).

In conclusion, older age is a significant factor influencing outcomes of out-of-hospital CPR. As age increases, the chances of survival to hospital discharge, ROSC, and 24-hour survival decrease, while the likelihood of poor neurologic outcomes at discharge increases. These findings highlight the importance of considering age as a prognostic factor in the management of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients.",1
"Increased microvascular permeability in vivo in response to intradermal injection of neutrophil-activating protein (NAP-2) in rabbit skin. We investigated the in vivo effects of neutrophil-activating protein (NAP-2) on microvascular permeability in rabbit skin. Intradermal injection of NAP-2 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in microvascular permeability, as demonstrated by extravasation of Evans blue dye. The increase in microvascular permeability was observed within 30 minutes of NAP-2 injection and reached maximum levels at 60 minutes. Pretreatment with indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, significantly attenuated the NAP-2-induced increase in microvascular permeability, suggesting an involvement of prostaglandins in this response. In addition, pretreatment with a rabbit anti-NAP-2 antibody was also able to attenuate the NAP-2-induced increase in microvascular permeability, confirming the specificity of the NAP-2 effect. These findings demonstrate that NAP-2 can induce an increase in microvascular permeability in rabbit skin, likely through the release of prostaglandins, and suggest a potential role for NAP-2 in the regulation of inflammation and tissue injury.",1
"Beta-carotene's effects on serum lipoproteins and immunologic indices in humans. Several studies have investigated the effects of beta-carotene supplementation on serum lipoproteins and immunologic indices in humans. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 50 healthy male volunteers received either 50 mg of beta-carotene or placebo daily for 12 weeks. Serum lipoproteins, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, were measured before and after supplementation. Immunologic indices, such as lymphocyte subset counts and cytokine levels, were also assessed. 

The results showed that beta-carotene supplementation did not significantly affect total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, or HDL cholesterol levels compared to the placebo group. However, a significant increase in serum beta-carotene levels was observed in the supplementation group. 

In terms of immunologic indices, no significant differences were found between the beta-carotene and placebo groups in terms of lymphocyte subset counts or cytokine levels. 

Overall, these findings suggest that beta-carotene supplementation does not have substantial effects on serum lipoproteins or immunologic indices in healthy individuals. Further research is needed to determine whether beta-carotene may have different effects in specific populations or disease states.",1

"Rigid spine syndrome with respiratory failure. Rigid spine syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle stiffness and contractures, predominantly affecting the axial muscles and respiratory system. We present a case of a 46-year-old male who presented with respiratory failure and was subsequently diagnosed with rigid spine syndrome. Respiratory muscle weakness was the main contributor to his respiratory compromise, requiring mechanical ventilation support. Upon further evaluation, the patient exhibited classic clinical features such as rigidity and limited range of motion in the spine, as well as joint contractures and scoliosis. Genetic testing confirmed a mutation in the SEPN1 gene, consistent with rigid spine syndrome. Treatment involved a multidisciplinary approach, including respiratory support, physical therapy, and management of associated complications. Clinicians should consider rigid spine syndrome in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with respiratory failure and an underlying neuromuscular condition. Early recognition and treatment initiation can significantly improve patient outcomes.",1

"Microspectrophotometric DNA analysis in ulcerative colitis with special reference to its application in diagnosis of carcinoma and dysplasia.  The deoxyribonucleic (DNA) content was measured by microspectrophotometry in 100 specimens from 60 patients with ulcerative colitis, including six patients in whom the colitis was associated with carcinoma. Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that carries an increased risk of developing colorectal carcinoma and dysplasia. Accurate diagnosis and surveillance for these complications are essential for proper management and patient outcomes. In this study, microspectrophotometric DNA analysis was performed on 100 specimens from 60 patients with UC, including six patients with associated carcinoma. 

The objective was to evaluate the potential application of microspectrophotometric DNA analysis in the diagnosis of carcinoma and dysplasia in UC patients. The DNA content was measured, and statistical analysis was conducted to determine any significant differences in DNA content between different diagnostic groups.

The findings of this study demonstrated that microspectrophotometric DNA analysis can effectively differentiate between normal colonic mucosa, dysplasia, and carcinoma in UC patients. The DNA content was significantly higher in dysplastic and carcinoma specimens compared to normal mucosa, providing a potential biomarker for the identification of high-risk lesions. 

The application of microspectrophotometric DNA analysis in the surveillance and diagnosis of carcinoma and dysplasia in UC patients holds promise for improving early detection and guiding appropriate management strategies.

"Limitation of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization using iodized oil for small hepatocellular carcinoma. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) using iodized oil is a commonly used treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, its efficacy in treating small HCCs remains controversial. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of TACE with iodized oil in 50 patients with small HCCs (≤3 cm in diameter). The overall objective response rate was 72%, with a complete response rate of 20%. However, the local tumor progression rate was high at 40%. We also observed that the presence of satellite nodules and a high percentage of tumor necrosis were independent risk factors for local tumor progression. These findings suggest that TACE with iodized oil may have limited efficacy in treating small HCCs, especially when satellite nodules are present. Further studies are needed to optimize treatment strategies for these patients.",1

"Elevated serum tumor markers in patients with testicular cancer after induction chemotherapy due to a reservoir of markers in cystic differentiated mature teratoma. Testicular cancer is a relatively common malignancy affecting young males. Treatment typically involves a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Serum tumor markers, such as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), are important in the diagnosis and surveillance of testicular cancer.

We report two cases of elevated post-chemotherapy serum tumor markers in patients with testicular cancer. Both patients had undergone induction chemotherapy following orchidectomy. Subsequent histopathological examination revealed the presence of cystic differentiated mature teratomas in both cases.

Cystic differentiated mature teratomas contain various components, including yolk sac elements and syncytiotrophoblasts, which can produce tumor markers. A reservoir of these markers in the teratoma may lead to persistent elevation of serum tumor markers even after successful chemotherapy.

These cases highlight the importance of considering the presence of residual teratoma in patients with elevated serum tumor markers after chemotherapy for testicular cancer. Further studies are warranted to better understand the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon and guide clinical management.",1

"Selenium in forage crops and cancer mortality in U. S. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between selenium levels in forage crops and cancer mortality rates in the United States. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program were analyzed. The selenium concentration in forage crops from different regions of the U.S. was determined using atomic absorption spectrometry. Cancer mortality rates were obtained from the SEER database.

The results revealed a significant inverse correlation between selenium levels in forage crops and cancer mortality rates. Regions with higher selenium concentrations in forage crops had lower cancer mortality rates, while regions with lower selenium concentrations had higher cancer mortality rates. This inverse correlation remained significant even after adjusting for various confounding factors such as age, sex, smoking status, and socioeconomic status.

These findings suggest that selenium levels in forage crops may play a role in reducing cancer mortality rates. Further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms and explore potential strategies to optimize selenium intake for cancer prevention.",1

"Rectal mucosal dysplasia in Crohn's disease.  Serial sections of 812 rectal biopsy specimens from 356 Crohn's disease patients were analysed for mucosal epithelial dysplasia. Rectal mucosal dysplasia is a common complication in patients with Crohn's disease. In this study, serial sections of 812 rectal biopsy specimens from 356 Crohn's disease patients were analyzed to investigate the prevalence and characteristics of mucosal epithelial dysplasia. The results revealed that a significant proportion of patients (42.7%) exhibited various degrees of dysplasia, including low-grade and high-grade dysplasia. The presence of dysplasia was associated with longer disease duration and increased severity of inflammation. Histological features such as cellular atypia, loss of architectural polarity, and increased mitotic activity were observed in dysplastic lesions. Molecular analysis further revealed the presence of genetic alterations, including mutations in tumor suppressor genes and chromosomal abnormalities. These findings underline the importance of routine surveillance and early detection of rectal mucosal dysplasia in Crohn's disease patients for timely intervention and prevention of malignancy.",1
"Synergism of herpes simplex virus and tobacco-specific N'-nitrosamines in cell transformation. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and tobacco-specific N'-nitrosamines (TSNAs) have been independently implicated in the development of various cancers. This study investigates the potential synergistic effect of HSV and TSNAs on cell transformation. Human embryonic lung fibroblast cells were infected with different strains of HSV and exposed to TSNAs. Cell viability, morphology, anchorage-independent growth, and gene expression were analyzed. Results showed that HSV infection alone induced morphological changes and increased cell proliferation, while TSNAs alone promoted anchorage-independent growth and altered gene expression. Interestingly, the combination of HSV infection and TSNAs exposure resulted in a more pronounced cell transformation phenotype, including increased cell proliferation, enhanced anchorage-independent growth, and altered gene expression patterns. These findings suggest a synergistic effect between HSV and TSNAs in promoting cell transformation, supporting the potential role of viral infection and tobacco carcinogens in the development of cancer. Further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and clinical implications.",1

"Low incidence of asymptomatic brain metastases in patients with renal cell carcinoma.  Brain metastases from renal cell carcinoma are uncommon. This study aimed to determine the incidence of asymptomatic brain metastases in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). A retrospective analysis of 320 patients diagnosed with RCC between 2005 and 2015 was conducted. Brain imaging studies, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans, were performed in all patients. Patient characteristics, tumor characteristics, treatment modalities, and the presence of brain metastases were reviewed. 

Of the 320 patients, only 17 (5.3%) were found to have brain metastases. Among these, 13 patients (76.5%) were symptomatic, presenting with neurological signs and symptoms. However, remarkably, only 4 patients (23.5%) exhibited asymptomatic brain metastases on routine imaging. The majority of patients with brain metastases had advanced RCC with a high Fuhrman grade and metastases in other organs.

In conclusion, this study demonstrates a low incidence of asymptomatic brain metastases in patients with RCC. Routine brain imaging may not be necessary in all patients with RCC, particularly in the absence of neurological symptoms. Further research is needed to identify risk factors and develop guidelines for the routine screening of brain metastases in patients with RCC.",1

"Expandable biliary metal stents for malignancies: endoscopic insertion and diathermic cleaning for tumor ingrowth. The use of expandable biliary metal stents has emerged as an effective palliative treatment option for patients with malignant biliary obstruction. However, one of the challenges associated with these stents is the occurrence of tumor ingrowth, which can lead to stent occlusion and subsequent biliary obstruction. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of endoscopic insertion of expandable biliary metal stents as well as the use of diathermic cleaning for tumor ingrowth.

A total of 75 patients with malignant biliary obstruction were included in the study. Expandable metal stents were successfully inserted in all patients, with immediate relief of biliary obstruction. However, tumor ingrowth was detected in 28 patients (37.3%) during the follow-up period. Diathermic cleaning was performed in these patients, resulting in successful removal of tumor ingrowth and restoration of stent patency in all cases.

No major complications were observed during the entire procedure. The mean stent patency duration was 6.2 months for patients with tumor ingrowth, which was comparable to those without tumor ingrowth.

In conclusion, the endoscopic insertion of expandable biliary metal stents is a safe and effective approach for managing malignant biliary obstruction. The use of diathermic cleaning for tumor ingrowth is a valuable technique for maintaining stent patency and reducing the need for repeat interventions. Further studies are needed to evaluate long-term outcomes and compare this technique with other palliative treatment options.",1

"In vitro and in vivo consequences of VLA-2 expression on rhabdomyosarcoma cells. The integrin VLA-2 is known to play a critical role in the attachment of cells to the extracellular matrix. In this study, we investigated the consequences of VLA-2 expression on the behavior of rhabdomyosarcoma cells both in vitro and in vivo. We found that overexpression of VLA-2 resulted in increased cell adhesion and spreading on collagen substrates in vitro. Additionally, in vivo experiments revealed that increased VLA-2 expression enhanced tumor formation and invasiveness in a xenograft mouse model. Furthermore, knockdown of VLA-2 expression in rhabdomyosarcoma cells led to reduced cell migration and invasion. These findings highlight the significance of VLA-2 in the tumorigenesis and metastasis of rhabdomyosarcoma. Further exploration of the underlying mechanisms may provide new therapeutic targets for this aggressive pediatric malignancy.",1
"Plasma epinephrine levels in resuscitation with cardiopulmonary bypass.  Since the highest plasma epinephrine levels have been recorded during resuscitation, we evaluated the isolated effect of cardiac arrest upon adrenomedullary secretion. In this study, we aimed to investigate the plasma epinephrine levels during resuscitation with cardiopulmonary bypass and the isolated effect of cardiac arrest on adrenomedullary secretion. A total of 32 patients undergoing elective cardiopulmonary bypass were included in the study. Blood samples were collected at multiple time points including pre-bypass, during bypass, during cardiac arrest, and post-bypass. Plasma epinephrine levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Our results showed that the highest levels of plasma epinephrine were indeed recorded during resuscitation, specifically during cardiac arrest. These levels were significantly higher compared to the pre-bypass levels (p<0.001). Moreover, a positive correlation was found between the duration of cardiac arrest and the peak plasma epinephrine levels (r=0.723, p<0.001). These findings suggest that the cessation of circulation during cardiac arrest triggers a significant release of epinephrine from the adrenomedullary cells. Further studies are needed to explore the underlying mechanisms and potential implications of these elevated epinephrine levels during resuscitation with cardiopulmonary bypass.",1

However, several cases have been reported in recent years, challenging this perception. This retrospective study aimed to examine the clinical features and outcomes of adults diagnosed with unilateral hydrocephalus. A total of 25 patients were included in the analysis. The most common presenting symptoms were headache (64%), gait disturbances (52%), and cognitive impairments (40%). Neuroimaging revealed ventricular enlargement on the affected side in all cases. Surgical intervention in the form of ventriculoperitoneal shunting was the primary treatment modality, resulting in significant improvement in symptoms and overall patient outcomes. Further research is warranted to better understand the etiology and optimal management strategies for this unique subgroup of hydrocephalus patients.",1
"Bleeding ectatic vascular lesion involving the sigmoid colon, endoscopically indistinguishable from angiodysplasia, in an 8-yr-old boy. An 8-year-old boy presented with recurrent episodes of painless rectal bleeding. Colonoscopy revealed a bleeding ectatic vascular lesion involving the sigmoid colon, which appeared similar to angiodysplasia. The lesion was not visible on previous upper endoscopy or capsule endoscopy. Histopathological examination of biopsy samples showed dilated and tortuous blood vessels with thin walls, consistent with angiodysplasia. Further investigations, including laboratory tests and imaging studies, revealed no systemic abnormalities or predisposing factors for angiodysplasia. The patient was treated conservatively with iron supplementation and regular follow-up. Angiodysplasia is a well-known cause of gastrointestinal bleeding in adults, but it is rare in children, especially in the sigmoid colon. This case highlights the importance of considering angiodysplasia as a potential cause of recurrent rectal bleeding in pediatric patients, even in unusual locations.",1
"Pulmonary vascular steal in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.  After pulmonary thromboendarterectomy, performed for relief of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, perfusion lung scans have frequently disclosed new perfusion defects in segments served by undissected pulmonary arteries. This phenomenon, known as pulmonary vascular steal, is believed to result from the redistribution of blood flow to the dissected areas after the surgery. However, the clinical significance of pulmonary vascular steal in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the incidence and characteristics of pulmonary vascular steal in patients undergoing pulmonary thromboendarterectomy. We reviewed the medical records of 50 patients who underwent the surgery and analyzed their preoperative and postoperative perfusion lung scans. Pulmonary vascular steal was found in 19 (38%) patients, with new perfusion defects observed in segments supplied by undissected pulmonary arteries. The occurrence of pulmonary vascular steal was not associated with the severity of preoperative pulmonary hypertension. Further research is needed to determine the impact of pulmonary vascular steal on patient outcomes and to develop strategies for its prevention and management.",1
"Controlled trial of antimycobacterial therapy in Crohn's disease.  Clofazimine versus placebo. Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease with unclear etiology. Recent evidence suggests that Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) may play a role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. This controlled trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy of antimycobacterial therapy in the treatment of Crohn's disease. 

Forty patients with active Crohn's disease were randomly assigned to receive either clofazimine, a known antimycobacterial agent, or placebo for 24 weeks. Clinical response and remission were assessed based on the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) scores. Endoscopic and histologic evaluations were also performed at baseline and at the end of the trial.

The results showed a statistically significant improvement in the clofazimine group compared to placebo in terms of clinical response (p = 0.02) and remission (p = 0.04). Endoscopic and histologic evaluations also demonstrated a greater reduction in inflammation in the clofazimine group.

These findings suggest that antimycobacterial therapy with clofazimine may be beneficial in the management of Crohn's disease. Further research is warranted to elucidate the mechanisms and long-term effects of this therapy.",1
"Recurrent herpetic keratitis: failure to detect herpes simplex virus infection using the Syva MicroTrak HSV1/HSV2 direct specimen identification/typing test. Recurrent herpetic keratitis is a common ocular condition characterized by the reactivation of the herpes simplex virus (HSV) in the cornea. Diagnosis of HSV infection in the cornea is crucial for appropriate management, as antiviral therapy can help prevent or reduce recurrent episodes. The Syva MicroTrak HSV1/HSV2 direct specimen identification/typing test is commonly used for the detection and typing of HSV in clinical specimens. However, this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of this test in detecting HSV infection in patients with recurrent herpetic keratitis. It was found that the Syva MicroTrak assay had a low sensitivity and failed to detect HSV infection in the majority of patients. Therefore, alternative diagnostic methods should be considered for accurate detection and typing of HSV in patients with recurrent herpetic keratitis.",1
"Obstructive sleep apnea presenting with nocturnal angina, heart failure, and near-miss sudden death. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder characterized by repetitive episodes of partial or complete upper airway obstruction during sleep. We report a case of OSA presenting with atypical symptoms including nocturnal angina, heart failure, and near-miss sudden death. A 58-year-old male presented with recurrent episodes of chest pain and dyspnea during sleep, accompanied by pulmonary congestion and significant desaturation on pulse oximetry. Polysomnography showed severe OSA with an apnea-hypopnea index of 78 events per hour. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy was initiated, resulting in resolution of the patient's symptoms and improvement in cardiac function. This case highlights the importance of considering OSA as a potential etiology in patients presenting with nocturnal angina and heart failure, as prompt diagnosis and treatment with CPAP can improve symptoms and prevent cardiovascular complications. Healthcare providers should maintain a high index of suspicion for OSA in patients with atypical symptoms related to sleep and initiate appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.",1
"Late metastases of cutaneous melanoma: case report and literature review.  The development of delayed metastases, although rare, is well documented in patients with invasive cutaneous melanoma. We present a case of late metastases of cutaneous melanoma and provide a review of the literature on this topic. The patient, a 54-year-old male, initially presented with a localized tumor on his back, which was successfully excised. However, 16 years later, he developed metastases to the lung and liver. Despite aggressive treatment including surgery and systemic therapy, the patient's condition deteriorated, and he eventually succumbed to the disease. Literature review identified several cases of late metastases in cutaneous melanoma, with a median time to metastasis of 11 years. This highlights the importance of long-term follow-up and surveillance for patients with a history of cutaneous melanoma, even after successful primary tumor removal.",1

This case emphasizes the importance of considering sepsis as a potential complication of intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin treatment and highlights the need for prompt recognition and aggressive management in these cases. Further research is needed to better understand the risk factors and develop strategies to prevent this potentially life-threatening complication.",1
"Intravesical condyloma acuminatum with progression to verrucous carcinoma. We present a rare case of intravesical condyloma acuminatum that progressed to verrucous carcinoma in a 56-year-old male. The patient initially presented with lower urinary tract symptoms and hematuria. Cystoscopy revealed multiple papillary lesions in the bladder, which were biopsied and diagnosed as condyloma acuminatum. Over the next few years, despite multiple treatment modalities including transurethral resection, laser ablation, and intravesical immunotherapy, the lesions gradually transformed into verrucous carcinoma. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis. Verrucous carcinoma is a distinct variant of squamous cell carcinoma, characterized by slow growth, absence of metastasis, and limited potential for invasion. Treatment options for verrucous carcinoma of the bladder are limited and primarily include surgery. Regular surveillance is crucial given the potential for malignant transformation. Further understanding of the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying this progression is warranted.",1

"A prospective randomized evaluation of chronic peritoneal catheters.  Insertion site and intraperitoneal segment. Chronic peritoneal catheters are commonly used in patients requiring long-term peritoneal dialysis. However, the optimal insertion site and intraperitoneal segment of these catheters remain unclear. In this study, we conducted a prospective randomized evaluation to compare the outcomes of chronic peritoneal catheters inserted either through the periumbilical or the lateral abdominal wall, and positioned in the pelvic or subdiaphragmatic region.

A total of 150 patients undergoing chronic peritoneal dialysis were randomly assigned to one of four groups: periumbilical pelvic (PP), periumbilical subdiaphragmatic (PS), lateral pelvic (LP), or lateral subdiaphragmatic (LS). The primary outcomes included catheter-related complications, such as infection, leakage, and obstruction, as well as overall catheter survival. Secondary outcomes included dialysis adequacy, hospitalization rates, and patient discomfort.

Preliminary results suggest that the periumbilical insertion site was associated with a lower incidence of catheter-related complications compared to the lateral abdominal wall (p<0.001). There was no significant difference in catheter survival or dialysis adequacy between the two insertion sites. However, patients in the periumbilical groups reported less postoperative pain and discomfort compared to those in the lateral abdominal wall groups (p=0.002).

Further analysis is ongoing to determine the optimal intraperitoneal segment for chronic peritoneal catheter placement. This study provides valuable insights into improving the outcomes and patient experience in peritoneal dialysis.",1

"Ki-67 immunostaining in uveal melanoma.  The effect of pre-enucleation radiotherapy. Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults. Pre-enucleation radiotherapy has been used as an adjuvant treatment for uveal melanoma to reduce the risk of tumor seeding during enucleation. This study aimed to investigate the effect of pre-enucleation radiotherapy on Ki-67 immunostaining in uveal melanoma. The study included 24 patients who underwent enucleation for uveal melanoma, with 12 patients receiving pre-enucleation radiotherapy and 12 patients not receiving any adjuvant treatment. Ki-67 immunostaining was performed on the tumor sections, and the proliferative index was determined. The results showed that the mean Ki-67 proliferative index was significantly lower in the pre-enucleation radiotherapy group compared to the control group (p<0.05). This suggests that pre-enucleation radiotherapy may have a suppressive effect on tumor cell proliferation in uveal melanoma. Further studies are needed to explore the potential role of Ki-67 immunostaining as a prognostic marker in uveal melanoma and the impact of pre-enucleation radiotherapy on long-term outcomes.",1
"Sympathomimetics for acute severe asthma: should only beta 2-selective agonists be used? Sympathomimetics have become a mainstay of the treatment of acute asthma. Sympathomimetics, specifically beta 2-selective agonists, have been widely used as the primary treatment option for acute severe asthma. However, the question remains as to whether only beta 2-selective agonists should be utilized or if other sympathomimetics could provide additional benefits. This review aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of various sympathomimetics in the management of acute severe asthma. Several studies comparing beta 2-selective agonists with non-selective sympathomimetics such as epinephrine and isoproterenol have shown comparable outcomes in terms of bronchodilation and symptom relief. Furthermore, non-selective sympathomimetics may offer advantages such as increased bronchodilation and systemic effects, which could be beneficial in severe cases. However, caution should be exercised due to the potential for cardiovascular side effects. Further research is needed to establish clear guidelines regarding the use of non-selective sympathomimetics in the treatment of acute severe asthma.",1
"Practice effects on the preprogramming of discrete movements in Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is characterized by motor symptoms such as bradykinesia and rigidity, which can severely affect the ability to perform voluntary movements. The present study aimed to investigate the practice effects on the preprogramming of discrete movements in individuals with Parkinson's disease. A total of 30 patients with Parkinson's disease and 30 age-matched healthy controls participated in the study. Participants performed a finger tapping task, and the movement times and error rates were recorded. The results showed that patients with Parkinson's disease exhibited longer movement times and higher error rates compared to healthy controls. Additionally, the practice effects were found to be significantly reduced in the patient group. This suggests that Parkinson's disease affects the preprogramming of discrete movements, leading to impaired motor performance and limited practice-related improvements. Further research is needed to develop effective interventions to enhance movement preprogramming in individuals with Parkinson's disease.",1

"Cerebrospinal fluid neopterin in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neopterin has been proposed as a marker of immune activation in various central nervous system (CNS) diseases. We investigated the levels of CSF neopterin in patients with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and its correlation with CNS involvement. CSF neopterin levels were significantly higher in HIV-1-infected patients with CNS involvement compared to those without CNS involvement (p<0.001). Furthermore, CSF neopterin levels were positively correlated with CSF HIV-1 RNA levels (p=0.002) and negatively correlated with CD4+ T-cell counts (p=0.006). These findings suggest that CSF neopterin may serve as a useful biomarker for monitoring immune activation and CNS involvement in HIV-1-infected patients. Future studies are needed to determine the potential role of CSF neopterin in predicting disease progression and guiding therapeutic interventions in this population.",1

"Reduction of mortality, sudden death and non-fatal reinfarction with beta-adrenergic blockers in survivors of acute myocardial infarction: a new hypothesis regarding the cardioprotective action of beta-adrenergic blockade. The use of beta-adrenergic blockers in survivors of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has been shown to reduce mortality, sudden death, and non-fatal reinfarction. The traditional hypothesis for the cardioprotective action of beta-adrenergic blockade suggests that it acts by reducing myocardial oxygen demand and improving myocardial perfusion. However, recent evidence suggests that the beneficial effects of beta-blockers may be due to their anti-inflammatory and anti-arrhythmic properties.

This study aimed to propose a new hypothesis regarding the cardioprotective action of beta-adrenergic blockade in survivors of AMI. The hypothesis suggests that beta-blockers exert their beneficial effects by modulating the immune response and reducing inflammation, resulting in a decrease in myocardial injury and remodeling. Additionally, beta-blockers may stabilize cardiac membranes and reduce arrhythmogenesis, further contributing to their cardioprotective effects.

Further research is needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms and to determine the optimal use of beta-blockers in the management of AMI. However, this new hypothesis provides a novel perspective on the potential benefits of beta-adrenergic blockade in this patient population.",1
"Diclofenac-associated hepatotoxicity Diclofenac sodium, a phenylacetic acid-derived nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) recently released in the United States, was associated with the development of significant hepatitis in seven patients, with one associated death. Diclofenac sodium, a widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), has been associated with hepatotoxicity. This study reports on seven patients who developed significant hepatitis following diclofenac sodium use, with one resultant death. The patients presented with symptoms such as jaundice, liver enzyme elevation, and hepatomegaly. Liver biopsies showed evidence of severe necrosis and inflammatory infiltrate. Upon discontinuation of diclofenac sodium, liver enzymes returned to normal levels and patients experienced clinical improvement. The exact mechanism of diclofenac-associated hepatotoxicity remains unclear, but it is believed to involve the formation of reactive metabolites and subsequent immune-mediated injury. Healthcare professionals should be aware of this potential adverse effect and consider alternative treatment options in patients with underlying liver disease.",1

"Etiologic importance of the intimal flap of the external carotid artery in the development of postcarotid endarterectomy stroke. Ischemic stroke is a known complication following carotid endarterectomy (CEA), and the etiology is often attributed to embolic events from plaque disruption. However, recent studies have suggested that the presence of an intimal flap in the external carotid artery (ECA) may play a significant role in the development of post-CEA stroke. This abstract aims to evaluate the etiologic importance of the intimal flap in the occurrence of post-CEA stroke.

The intimal flap is believed to occur due to shearing forces during CEA, leading to dissection and subsequent flap formation. This flap has the potential to act as a nidus for thrombus formation and embolization, thereby contributing to post-CEA stroke. The authors review the existing literature on the prevalence, characteristics, and clinical implications of the intimal flap in relation to stroke occurrence. Additionally, they discuss possible prevention and management strategies for reducing the risk of post-CEA stroke associated with the intimal flap. Further research is needed to fully understand the pathophysiological mechanisms and determine optimal strategies for prevention and treatment.",1
"Total bladder replacement using detubularized sigmoid colon: technique and results.  We performed total bladder replacement with a detubularized segment of sigmoid colon in patients after cystoprostatectomy. Total bladder replacement using detubularized sigmoid colon is a surgical technique used in patients who have undergone cystoprostatectomy. The procedure involves utilizing a section of the sigmoid colon and creating a neobladder to replace the excised bladder. This abstract presents the technique and results of total bladder replacement using detubularized sigmoid colon.

The procedure was performed on a cohort of patients who had undergone cystoprostatectomy due to bladder cancer. A segment of the sigmoid colon was isolated and detubularized to create a new bladder. The new bladder was then anastomosed to the urethra to restore urinary function. Post-operative follow-up was conducted to assess the outcomes and complications associated with the procedure.

Preliminary results indicate that total bladder replacement using detubularized sigmoid colon is a viable option for patients after cystoprostatectomy. Patients reported improved urinary function and quality of life post-surgery. Complications such as urinary leakage and urinary tract infections were observed in a small percentage of cases.

"Current concepts of cholesterol transport and crystal formation in human bile.  The presence of vesicles in human bile probably accounts almost entirely for the frequently observed, but hitherto unexplained, phenomenon of metastable cholesterol supersaturation. Cholesterol transport and crystal formation in human bile have been subjects of extensive research due to their contribution to the development of gallstones. This study aimed to explore the current concepts regarding these processes. It was found that the presence of vesicles in human bile is the main factor responsible for the commonly observed metastable cholesterol supersaturation, which had previously lacked an explanation. These vesicles serve as platforms for cholesterol nucleation and crystal growth. Furthermore, it was discovered that the vesicles originate from the liver and are then modified in the gallbladder. The importance of biliary glycoproteins and phospholipids in regulating cholesterol solubility was also highlighted. Understanding the mechanisms behind cholesterol transport and crystal formation in human bile provides valuable insights into the pathogenesis of gallstones and may pave the way for future preventative and therapeutic strategies.",1

Further studies are needed to explore the optimal management strategies for pregnant women with craniopharyngiomas and associated DI.",1
"Femoral arteriovenous fistula as a complication of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.  A report of five cases. We present a case series of five patients who developed femoral arteriovenous fistula as a complication of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). These patients underwent PTCA for various indications, including unstable angina and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. The femoral arteriovenous fistulas were identified during routine post-procedural angiography and confirmed by Doppler ultrasound. All patients were managed conservatively, with close monitoring for signs of hemodynamic instability or worsening symptoms. Follow-up imaging demonstrated healing of the fistulas in four patients within three months, while one patient required surgical intervention due to persistent symptoms. Our case series highlights the importance of recognizing this rare complication of PTCA, as prompt diagnosis and management can lead to favorable outcomes. Furthermore, it emphasizes the need for careful assessment and surveillance during and after PTCA procedures to identify potential vascular complications and ensure appropriate management.",1

Monitoring spinal cord function is crucial to detect early signs of ischemia and prevent permanent neurological deficits. This study aimed to evaluate the use of spinal cord stimulation evoked potentials (SCEPs) in monitoring spinal cord function during thoracoabdominal aneurysm surgery. Ten patients undergoing thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair were included in the study. SCEPs were recorded before, during, and after surgery. Changes in SCEP waveforms and amplitudes were correlated with intraoperative events and postoperative neurological outcomes. Our results showed that monitoring SCEPs provided real-time information on spinal cord function and helped identify potential ischemic events. Further studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to validate the efficacy of SCEPs in preventing spinal cord injury during thoracoabdominal aneurysm surgery.",1
"Comparison of pulse oximeters: accuracy at low arterial pressure in volunteers. The accuracy of pulse oximeters in measuring arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) at low arterial pressures was evaluated in a group of volunteers. Participants were subjected to intentional hypotension induced by controlled drug infusion. Measurements were taken using two different pulse oximeters simultaneously, along with invasive arterial blood gas analysis as the reference standard. The mean arterial pressure during the study was 62 mmHg. Results showed that both pulse oximeters underestimated SpO2 compared to the reference standard, with a greater deviation at lower arterial pressures. The accuracy of the pulse oximeters worsened as the arterial pressure decreased, with one device showing a larger discrepancy than the other. This study highlights the limitations of pulse oximeters in accurately measuring SpO2 during hypotensive states and emphasizes the need for caution when interpreting oxygen saturation readings in such scenarios.",1

"Dexamethasone increases plasma levels of albendazole. Albendazole, a broad-spectrum anthelmintic drug, is commonly used for the treatment of parasite infections. However, its low oral bioavailability limits its efficacy. This study investigated the effect of dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid, on the plasma levels of albendazole in healthy volunteers. The participants were divided into two groups: one group received albendazole alone, while the other group received albendazole in combination with dexamethasone. Plasma levels of albendazole were measured at different time points after administration. The results showed that the co-administration of dexamethasone significantly increased the plasma concentrations of albendazole compared to the albendazole alone group. This finding suggests that dexamethasone may enhance the bioavailability of albendazole and could potentially improve its therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of parasite infections. Further research is needed to investigate the mechanism behind this interaction and evaluate its clinical implications.",1

These results highlight the potential harmful effects of copper, mercury, and tin salts on the oral mucosa and suggest the need for further investigation into their safety profiles.",1
"A frameshift mutation leading to type 1 antithrombin deficiency and thrombosis. Type 1 antithrombin deficiency is a hereditary thrombophilia caused by mutations in the SERPINC1 gene, leading to decreased levels of functional antithrombin protein. However, frameshift mutations leading to type 1 antithrombin deficiency are less commonly reported. We present a case of a 35-year-old female with recurrent venous thromboembolism and a strong family history of thrombosis. Genetic analysis revealed a frameshift mutation in the SERPINC1 gene resulting in a premature stop codon and a truncated non-functional protein. Thrombophilia evaluation showed significantly reduced antithrombin activity and antigen levels. The patient was started on lifelong anticoagulation therapy and genetic counseling was offered to her family members. Frameshift mutations leading to type 1 antithrombin deficiency are rare but should be considered in patients presenting with recurrent thrombosis and a family history of hypercoagulability. Genetic testing is crucial for diagnosis and appropriate management of these cases.",1
"Factors related to treatment resistance in hypertension. Hypertension is a common and chronic medical condition that affects millions of individuals worldwide. Despite the availability of numerous antihypertensive medications, some patients fail to achieve adequate blood pressure control, resulting in treatment resistance. This study aimed to identify factors associated with treatment resistance in hypertension. A total of 328 patients with diagnosed hypertension were included in the analysis. Data on patient demographics, lifestyle factors, coexisting medical conditions, and medication adherence were collected. Treatment resistance was defined as persistent elevation of blood pressure despite treatment with three or more antihypertensive medications. The results showed that older age, obesity, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and non-adherence to medication were significantly associated with treatment resistance (p<0.05). These findings highlight the importance of addressing modifiable risk factors and improving medication adherence to optimize blood pressure control in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension. Further studies are warranted to explore additional factors and interventions that may improve treatment outcomes in this population.",1
"Intraoperative protection of cranial nerves and perforating arteries by silicone rubber sheets. A case report. During certain surgical procedures, protection of cranial nerves and perforating arteries is of utmost importance to prevent potential complications. Current techniques for intraoperative protection include the use of cottonoids or biological glues, but these methods may not provide adequate protection or may have limitations. Silicone rubber sheets have been proposed as an alternative for superior protection due to their flexibility and ability to conform to the surrounding anatomy.

These techniques demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of silicone rubber sheets in providing optimal protection, thereby minimizing the risk of nerve injury or vascular complications.",1
"Tumor factors predicting for prognosis in metastatic breast cancer.  The presence of P24 predicts for response to treatment and duration of survival. The aim of this study was to identify tumor factors that can predict prognosis in patients with metastatic breast cancer. We analyzed data from 76 patients who were diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer and underwent treatment. Tumor samples were collected and analyzed for various biomarkers, including P24. Patients were followed up for a median duration of 24 months to assess treatment response and survival outcomes.

Our findings revealed that the presence of P24 in tumor samples was significantly associated with a higher response to treatment. Patients with P24-positive tumors had a higher rate of complete or partial response to therapy compared to those with P24-negative tumors. Furthermore, the presence of P24 was also found to be a predictor of longer overall survival. Patients with P24-positive tumors had a significantly longer median survival compared to those with P24-negative tumors.

These results suggest that P24 can serve as a promising prognostic biomarker in metastatic breast cancer. Further studies are warranted to validate these findings and to understand the underlying mechanisms by which P24 influences treatment response and survival outcomes.",1
"Immunohistochemical interpretation of early epithelial disorders of pyriform sinus. Early epithelial disorders of the pyriform sinus are often challenging to diagnose due to their subtle clinical presentation. In this study, we aimed to investigate the immunohistochemical characteristics of these disorders to improve diagnostic accuracy. Seventy-five patients presenting with early epithelial changes in the pyriform sinus were included in this retrospective analysis. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using a panel of markers including cytokeratin 7, p63, Ki-67, and CD44. Results showed that cytokeratin 7 expression was decreased in patients with dysplasia compared to those with normal epithelium, indicating its potential as a diagnostic marker. Additionally, p63 expression was found to be significantly increased in patients with dysplasia, suggesting its utility in distinguishing between dysplastic and non-dysplastic lesions. Ki-67 and CD44 expression were also altered in dysplastic lesions, further supporting their role in the early detection and characterization of epithelial disorders in the pyriform sinus. These findings provide valuable insights into the immunohistochemical features of early stage pyriform sinus disorders and may aid in improving diagnostic strategies for these challenging conditions.",1
"T cell receptor peptide therapy triggers autoregulation of experimental encephalomyelitis. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a widely used animal model for studying multiple sclerosis. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of T cell receptor (TCR) peptide therapy in EAE. Mice with established EAE were treated with a peptide derived from the TCR sequence specific to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). We found that TCR peptide therapy ameliorated the clinical symptoms of EAE and reduced the central nervous system inflammation seen in untreated mice. Interestingly, this therapeutic effect was associated with the induction of a regulatory T cell (Treg) response. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that TCR peptide treatment led to the expansion of MOG-specific Tregs with suppressive activity. Moreover, TCR peptide therapy induced upregulation of the transcription factor Foxp3, a key marker of Tregs. These findings suggest that TCR peptide therapy triggers autoregulation of EAE by promoting the expansion and activation of antigen-specific Tregs. This study highlights the potential of TCR peptide therapy as a novel approach for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis.",1

"Premature menopause because of an inherited deletion in the long arm of the X-chromosome.  A family is described in which both a mother and an infertile daughter had premature menopause at the ages of 31 and 28 years, respectively. Premature menopause, also known as premature ovarian failure, is a condition characterized by the loss of ovarian function before the age of 40. In this study, we report a family in which both the mother and daughter experienced premature menopause at relatively young ages. Further investigation revealed an inherited deletion in the long arm of the X-chromosome in both affected individuals. This genetic abnormality may disrupt the normal functioning of ovarian cells, leading to the early onset of menopause. Understanding the underlying genetic mechanisms contributing to premature menopause is crucial for early detection and management of this condition. Identification of such genetic markers may facilitate personalized approaches for the prevention and treatment of infertility and associated complications in affected individuals.",1
"The effects of rate, sequencing, and memory on auditory processing in the elderly. This study aimed to investigate the effects of rate, sequencing, and memory on auditory processing in the elderly population. Participants were recruited from senior community centers and were categorized into two groups based on their cognitive abilities. Auditory processing tasks were administered, including rate perception, sequencing discrimination, and memory recall. Results showed that the elderly participants performed significantly lower than the younger participants in all three tasks. Within the elderly group, those with higher cognitive abilities performed better than those with lower cognitive abilities. Moreover, a strong correlation was found between sequencing discrimination and memory recall, suggesting that the ability to accurately perceive and remember sequences of auditory stimuli is closely linked in the elderly. These findings highlight the importance of considering rate, sequencing, and memory abilities when assessing auditory processing in older adults, and may have implications for the development of targeted interventions to improve auditory function in this population.",1
"A possible role for antiphospholipid antibodies in acquired cardiac valve deformity. Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) have been associated with various clinical manifestations, including thrombosis and pregnancy complications, in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Recently, there has been growing evidence suggesting a potential role of aPL in acquired cardiac valve deformity. This abstract aims to review the current literature and summarize the findings regarding the relationship between aPL and acquired cardiac valve deformity.

Several case reports and small observational studies have reported a higher prevalence of aPL in patients with acquired cardiac valve deformity, particularly mitral valve stenosis and regurgitation. These findings suggest that aPL may contribute to the pathogenesis of valve damage, possibly through thrombotic events, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction.

Further studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this association and to determine the clinical implications. If confirmed, the presence of aPL in patients with acquired cardiac valve deformity may have important diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications, including the consideration of anticoagulation therapy and the monitoring of valve function in patients with APS.",1

"Open reduction and fixation of proximal humeral fractures and fracture-dislocations. Proximal humeral fractures and fracture-dislocations are common injuries that often result from high-energy trauma. The optimal management of these fractures remains controversial. Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) has emerged as a popular surgical strategy. However, the outcomes of ORIF for these complex fractures are still debated. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and radiographic outcomes of ORIF in patients with proximal humeral fractures and fracture-dislocations. A retrospective analysis was conducted on a cohort of patients who underwent ORIF between [time period]. Patients were assessed for functional outcomes, complications, and radiographic union. The results showed that ORIF provided satisfactory functional outcomes and high rates of union in patients with proximal humeral fractures and fracture-dislocations. However, a subset of patients experienced complications, such as malunion, avascular necrosis, and hardware-related problems. Further studies are needed to identify the factors that contribute to these complications and to determine the optimal surgical approach for these complex fractures.",1
"Local failure and related complications after definitive treatment of carcinoma of the prostate by irradiation or surgery. Local failure and related complications following definitive treatment of prostate carcinoma, whether by radiation or surgery, remain significant challenges in the management of this disease. In this study, we aimed to identify the frequency and nature of local failure and associated complications in patients undergoing either irradiation or surgical intervention. We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with prostate carcinoma treated at our institution over a five-year period. Our findings demonstrate that local failure, defined as the presence of tumor recurrence within the prostate or surrounding tissues, occurred in a substantial proportion of patients following both radiation and surgery. Moreover, these local failures were frequently associated with complications such as urinary incontinence, urethral strictures, and rectal injury. These results underscore the need for improved local control strategies and vigilant post-treatment surveillance to minimize the impact of these complications and optimize patient outcomes.",1
"In vivo rheologic effects of lipid apheresis techniques: comparison of dextran sulfate LDL adsorption and heparin induced LDL precipitation. The aim of this study was to compare the in vivo rheologic effects of two lipid apheresis techniques: dextran sulfate LDL adsorption (DS-LDL) and heparin-induced LDL precipitation (HIP). Fourteen patients with severe hypercholesterolemia underwent 6 weeks of DS-LDL and 6 weeks of HIP treatments in a crossover design. Blood samples were collected before and after each treatment to measure plasma viscosity, erythrocyte aggregation, and fibrinogen levels. Results showed that both DS-LDL and HIP significantly reduced plasma viscosity and erythrocyte aggregation compared to baseline levels (p < 0.05). However, there were no significant differences between the two techniques in terms of their effects on these rheologic parameters. Fibrinogen levels were not significantly changed by either treatment. These findings indicate that both DS-LDL and HIP are effective in improving blood rheology in patients with severe hypercholesterolemia, suggesting their potential use in the management of cardiovascular disease.",1
"Magnetic resonance imaging in motor neuron disease. Motor neuron disease (MND) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of upper and lower motor neurons. The diagnosis and monitoring of MND are challenging, and thus there is a need for reliable and non-invasive imaging techniques.

"Echocardiographic diagnosis of a ruptured aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva: operation without catheterisation in seven patients. Ruptured aneurysms of the sinus of Valsalva are rare but potentially life-threatening cardiac conditions that often require surgical intervention. Traditionally, the diagnosis involves cardiac catheterisation for accurate assessment and planning of surgical repair. However, we present a case series of seven patients in whom the diagnosis was made using echocardiography alone, eliminating the need for invasive catheterisation. The patients presented with symptoms such as chest pain, dyspnea, and palpitations, and were found to have aortic regurgitation and an abnormal mass in the left or right ventricular outflow tract on echocardiography. Transesophageal echocardiography was particularly valuable in visualising the ruptured aneurysm and assessing its location and size, allowing for precise surgical planning. All seven patients underwent successful surgical repair without any complications, demonstrating that echocardiography alone can be a reliable and non-invasive method for diagnosing and guiding the management of ruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysms.",1

A total of 30 children diagnosed with spastic diplegia CP were included in the study. Gross motor function was assessed using the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) and the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) was used to evaluate spasticity. The results revealed that children with spastic diplegia exhibited significant impairments in gross motor function, particularly in the areas of walking, running, and jumping. Additionally, a positive correlation was found between spasticity levels and gross motor impairment. These findings highlight the need for early intervention and targeted rehabilitation programs to improve gross motor function and manage spasticity in children with spastic diplegia CP.",1
"Detection of hepatitis B virus DNA by polymerase chain reaction in plasma of volunteer blood donors negative for hepatitis B surface antigen. To evaluate the presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA in volunteer blood donors who tested negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), a total of 256 blood samples were collected and screened using both serological and molecular methods. All donors tested negative for HBsAg using enzyme immunoassay. However, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis was performed to detect the presence of HBV DNA in plasma samples. PCR detected HBV DNA in 4 out of 256 samples (1.6%). Further analysis revealed that these individuals had low viral loads, ranging from 32 to 98 IU/mL. No significant differences in demographic characteristics were observed between HBV DNA-positive and HBV DNA-negative donors. These findings suggest that a small proportion of volunteer blood donors who are HBsAg-negative may still harbor HBV DNA in their plasma. Therefore, screening for HBV DNA using PCR may be necessary to identify potential HBV carriers and prevent transmission of the virus through blood transfusion.",1

"A placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, two-center, pilot trial of Cop 1 in chronic progressive multiple sclerosis.  We found Cop 1 to be effective and relatively safe in a previous (exacerbating-remitting) clinical trial.  This current trial involves 106 chronic-progressive patients. We conducted a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, two-center pilot trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cop 1 in patients with chronic progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). Cop 1, which has shown efficacy in a previous exacerbating-remitting clinical trial, was administered to 106 chronic-progressive MS patients. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either Cop 1 or placebo for a 2-year treatment period.

Our findings indicate that Cop 1 was effective in reducing disease progression and improving clinical outcomes in chronic progressive MS patients. Compared to the placebo group, the Cop 1 group exhibited a significant decrease in disability progression as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Additionally, Cop 1 treatment resulted in a reduction in the number of relapses and the severity of relapses.

Overall, Cop 1 demonstrated a favorable safety profile with minimal adverse effects reported. These preliminary results suggest that Cop 1 may be a promising therapeutic option for patients with chronic progressive MS. Further larger-scale studies are warranted to confirm these findings.",1
"Pharmacokinetics of paracetamol after cardiac surgery. Paracetamol is a commonly used analgesic after cardiac surgery. However, little is known about its pharmacokinetics in this specific patient population. This study aimed to investigate the pharmacokinetics of paracetamol in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and its correlation with clinical outcomes. A total of 50 patients were included in the study and received intravenous paracetamol postoperatively. Blood samples were collected at different time intervals to measure paracetamol concentrations. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using non-compartmental analysis. The results showed that the mean maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC) of paracetamol were significantly higher in cardiac surgery patients compared to healthy individuals. Additionally, there was a positive correlation between the AUC and duration of mechanical ventilation, indicating that paracetamol clearance might be impaired in these patients. This study highlights the need for further research to optimize dosing and administration of paracetamol in cardiac surgery patients to ensure adequate pain relief and minimize adverse effects.",1

"Fucosylated oligosaccharides of human milk protect suckling mice from heat-stabile enterotoxin of Escherichia coli.  Human milk protects suckling mice from the diarrheagenic effects of heat-stabile enterotoxin of Escherichia coli (ST). Fucosylated oligosaccharides (FOS) present in human milk have been shown to provide protection against heat-stabile enterotoxin of Escherichia coli (ST) in suckling mice. This study aimed to investigate the specific mechanism by which FOS exert their protective effects. Suckling mice were orally administered FOS, followed by intragastric administration of ST. Results demonstrated that FOS significantly reduced the incidence and severity of ST-induced diarrhea in the mice. Additionally, FOS treatment inhibited ST-induced fluid accumulation and intestinal secretion in the small intestine. Further analysis revealed that FOS directly bound to ST and prevented its interaction with the intestinal epithelium, thereby inhibiting ST-induced activation of adenylate cyclase and subsequent upregulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. These findings highlight the importance of FOS in providing protection against ST-induced diarrhea in suckling mice and suggest their potential as a therapeutic strategy for preventing enterotoxigenic E. coli infections in infants. Further research is warranted to explore the clinical application of FOS in preventing diarrheal diseases in infants.",1

Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) is a common method of pain management after surgery, allowing patients to self-administer analgesic medication through a programmable pump. However, little is known about patients' expectations surrounding PCA and its impact on their overall satisfaction and pain management experience. This study aimed to evaluate patients' expectations of PCA and assess how well these expectations align with their actual experience. A survey was conducted among postoperative patients who had received PCA. Results showed that patients generally had high expectations of PCA, primarily focusing on pain relief and medication availability. However, there were discrepancies between these expectations and their actual experiences, particularly in terms of pain relief effectiveness and side effects. Better communication between healthcare professionals and patients regarding realistic expectations of PCA may help enhance patient satisfaction and optimize pain management strategies.",1
"Laser angioplasty: results of a prospective, multicenter study at 3-year follow-up.  A prospective multicenter trial was initiated to evaluate the efficacy and safety of laser angioplasty. The study aimed to evaluate the long-term outcomes of laser angioplasty in patients with obstructive coronary artery disease. A total of 300 patients from multiple centers were enrolled in the study and followed up for a period of 3 years. The primary endpoint of the study was the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), including death, myocardial infarction, and target vessel revascularization.

The results of the study demonstrated favorable outcomes in terms of both efficacy and safety. The overall success rate of laser angioplasty was 85%, with a significant improvement in coronary artery stenosis. The incidence of MACE was relatively low, with only 10% of patients experiencing such events during the follow-up period. Importantly, there were no cases of laser-related complications or adverse events.

In conclusion, laser angioplasty appears to be an effective and safe treatment option for patients with obstructive coronary artery disease. The favorable long-term outcomes suggest its potential as an alternative or adjunctive therapy to conventional balloon angioplasty or stenting. Further studies are warranted to validate these findings and assess the optimal indications for laser angioplasty in the management of coronary artery disease.",1
"Optimum results of the surgical treatment of carotid territory ischemia. Carotid territory ischemia, often caused by carotid artery stenosis, is a leading cause of transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) and strokes. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of surgical treatment in achieving optimum results for patients with carotid territory ischemia. A retrospective analysis of 100 patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA) was conducted. Preoperative evaluation included clinical assessment, carotid angiography, and neuroimaging. Postoperative follow-up assessments were conducted at regular intervals to evaluate neurological outcomes and the occurrence of recurrent ischemic events. The results demonstrated a significant improvement in carotid territory ischemia symptoms, including a reduction in TIAs and strokes, following CEA. Furthermore, there were no major perioperative complications observed. The findings support the use of surgical treatment, specifically CEA, as an effective approach for managing carotid territory ischemia and reducing the risk of recurrent ischemic events.",1
"Mechanical measures in the prophylaxis of postoperative thromboembolism in total knee arthroplasty. Postoperative thromboembolism is a significant concern in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of mechanical measures in preventing postoperative thromboembolism in TKA. A total of 200 patients undergoing TKA were included in the study. Half of the patients received mechanical measures such as intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) and compression stockings, while the other half did not receive any mechanical prophylaxis. The incidence of postoperative thromboembolism was significantly lower in the group receiving mechanical measures compared to the control group (7% vs. 19%, p<0.05). Furthermore, the use of mechanical measures was associated with a lower rate of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (3% vs. 10%, p<0.05) and pulmonary embolism (PE) (4% vs. 9%, p<0.05). These findings suggest that implementing mechanical prophylaxis measures such as IPC and compression stockings can effectively reduce the risk of postoperative thromboembolism in TKA patients.",1
"Standards for analysis of ventricular late potentials using high-resolution or signal-averaged electrocardiography. High-resolution or signal-averaged electrocardiography (SAECG) is a method used for the analysis of ventricular late potentials (VLP), which are low-amplitude electrical signals associated with an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. However, there is a lack of universally accepted standards for the analysis of VLP using these techniques. In this study, we aimed to establish standardized protocols for the analysis of VLP using high-resolution and SAECG. We conducted a systematic review of literature and gathered consensus from a panel of experts in the field. Our findings indicate that standardized protocols should include criteria for electrode placement, recording and filtering parameters, criteria for noise exclusion, and specific parameters for the identification of VLP. Implementation of these standardized protocols will enhance the accuracy and reproducibility of VLP analysis, leading to improved risk stratification and management of patients at risk for ventricular arrhythmias.",1
"Application of INSTAT hemostat in the control of gingival hemorrhage in the patient with thrombocytopenia. Gingival hemorrhage is a common complication in patients with thrombocytopenia, and effective management is crucial to prevent excessive bleeding. This case report discusses the successful use of the INSTAT hemostat in controlling gingival hemorrhage in a patient with thrombocytopenia. The INSTAT hemostat is a topical hemostatic agent that promotes rapid clotting by enhancing platelet aggregation and activating the clotting cascade. In this case, the patient presented with severe gingival bleeding due to low platelet counts. The INSTAT hemostat was applied directly to the bleeding site, resulting in immediate cessation of bleeding and providing a temporary protective barrier. This case highlights the potential utility of the INSTAT hemostat in managing gingival hemorrhage in patients with thrombocytopenia, offering an effective and safe alternative to traditional methods of hemostasis.",1
"Nonoperative management of bile duct stones.  The treatment of choice for most retained bile duct stones is by nonoperative means. Nonoperative management of bile duct stones remains the treatment of choice for most patients. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with sphincterotomy and stone extraction is the standard technique utilized. However, this procedure is associated with a significant risk of complications. Various nonoperative modalities have been introduced as alternative treatment options, including extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), oral dissolution therapy, and endoscopic papillary balloon dilation (EPBD). These nonoperative approaches have shown promising results in terms of stone clearance rates and safety profiles. Patient selection plays a crucial role in determining the optimal nonoperative management strategy, with consideration of stone size, location, number, and patient factors. A tailored approach is necessary for optimal outcomes and patient satisfaction.",1
"Simultaneous hepatoblastoma in identical male twins. Hepatoblastoma is a rare type of liver cancer that primarily affects children. This case report presents the occurrence of simultaneous hepatoblastoma in identical male twins. Both twins, aged 3 years, presented with abdominal distension and hepatomegaly. Radiological imaging revealed large hepatic masses in both cases, along with metastases to the lungs. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of hepatoblastoma in both twins, characterized by the presence of embryonic and fetal epithelial components.

Despite this aggressive treatment approach, one twin succumbed to disease progression after three cycles of chemotherapy, while the other twin achieved partial response after six cycles. This case highlights the unusual occurrence of simultaneous hepatoblastoma in identical twins and underscores the need for prompt diagnosis, comprehensive staging, and tailored treatment strategies in such cases. Further research is warranted to explore the underlying genetic and environmental factors that may contribute to the development of hepatoblastoma in twins.",1
"Transcranial Doppler in acute hemispheric brain infarction. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) has emerged as a non-invasive tool for monitoring cerebral hemodynamics in acute stroke. This study aimed to evaluate the utility of TCD in predicting the clinical outcome in patients with acute hemispheric brain infarction (AHBI). A total of 78 patients with AHBI were enrolled and underwent TCD examination within 24 hours after symptom onset. The TCD parameters including mean flow velocity (MFV), pulsatility index (PI), and resistance index (RI) were measured and compared with the clinical outcome assessed using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 3 months. The results showed that patients with poor clinical outcome (mRS > 2) had significantly higher MFV, PI, and RI compared to those with good clinical outcome (mRS ≤ 2). Multivariate analysis revealed that higher MFV and PI were independent predictors of poor clinical outcome. TCD can be a valuable tool for early risk stratification and outcome prediction in patients with AHBI. Further studies are warranted to establish the optimal TCD parameters and threshold values for predicting prognosis in this population.",1
"Esophageal motility, heartburn, and gastroesophageal reflux: variations in clinical presentation of esophageal dysphagia.

"11 beta-hydroxyandrostenedione: a marker of adrenal function in hirsutism. Hirsutism is a common disorder characterized by excessive hair growth in women. The underlying pathology involves increased androgen production, often originating from the adrenal glands. Various markers of adrenal function have been studied in hirsutism, including serum levels of 11 beta-hydroxyandrostenedione (11-OHA), a adrenal androgen precursor. This study aimed to investigate the potential clinical utility of 11-OHA as a marker of adrenal function in hirsutism. 

A systematic literature review was conducted to evaluate the available evidence regarding the association between 11-OHA levels and adrenal function in hirsutism. Several studies consistently demonstrated elevated serum levels of 11-OHA in hirsute patients compared to controls, indicating increased adrenal androgen production. Furthermore, 11-OHA levels correlated positively with other markers of adrenal androgen excess, such as dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and androstenedione. 

These findings suggest that 11-OHA can serve as a reliable marker of adrenal function in hirsutism. Its measurement may provide valuable information for the diagnosis and management of this disorder. However, further research is needed to establish optimal cut-off values and determine its clinical significance in guiding therapeutic interventions.",1
"Thalidomide: treatment of severe recurrent aphthous stomatitis in patients with AIDS. Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is a common oral mucosal disorder characterized by painful mouth ulcers. It frequently occurs in patients with AIDS, significantly impacting their quality of life. Thalidomide, a sedative-hypnotic agent, has emerged as a potential therapeutic option for severe RAS in AIDS patients. This abstract reviews the clinical efficacy and safety of thalidomide in treating severe recurrent aphthous stomatitis in patients with AIDS. Multiple studies have reported a significant reduction in ulcer duration, pain intensity, and ulcer recurrence rates with thalidomide therapy. However, caution should be exercised due to the potential teratogenicity and neuropathy associated with thalidomide. Further research is needed to optimize thalidomide dosing and duration of treatment in this patient population.",1
"Double-blind comparison of doxazosin and enalapril in patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension.  The antihypertensive efficacy and safety of doxazosin and enalapril were compared in the general practice setting (n = 54). Patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension were randomly assigned to receive either doxazosin or enalapril for a period of 12 weeks. Blood pressure measurements were taken at baseline and at the end of the study period. Both medications were found to significantly reduce blood pressure from baseline levels. Although there was no significant difference in the reduction of systolic blood pressure between the two groups, doxazosin was shown to be significantly more effective than enalapril in lowering diastolic blood pressure. Adverse events were minimal and similar between the two groups. These findings suggest that both doxazosin and enalapril are effective and well-tolerated treatments for mild to moderate essential hypertension, with doxazosin potentially offering a greater reduction in diastolic blood pressure. Further studies are needed to validate these results.",1
"Acute naming deficits following dominant temporal lobectomy: prediction by age at 1st risk for seizures. Dominant temporal lobectomy is a surgical procedure that is commonly used to treat drug-resistant epilepsy. However, there have been cases in which patients experience acute naming deficits following the surgery. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether the age at first risk for seizures could predict the occurrence of naming deficits after dominant temporal lobectomy. We analyzed data from a cohort of patients who underwent the surgery and found that younger age at first risk for seizures was a significant predictor of acute naming deficits. These findings suggest that early onset of epilepsy may result in a higher risk of postoperative language impairments, specifically in the domain of naming abilities. This information can help clinicians better assess and inform patients about potential language outcomes following dominant temporal lobectomy.",1
"Maintenance and relapse after weight loss in women: behavioral aspects. Weight loss interventions often lead to initial success, but maintenance of weight loss remains a challenge for many individuals, particularly women. The aim of this study was to explore the behavioral aspects related to maintenance and relapse after weight loss in women. A total of 100 women who had successfully achieved a clinically significant weight loss of at least 5% were followed up for 12 months. Self-reported measures of dietary habits, physical activity, and psychological factors were assessed at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. The results revealed that adherence to healthy eating behaviors and regular physical activity were significantly associated with weight maintenance. Additionally, psychological factors such as self-efficacy, stress, and emotional eating were found to play a role in weight regain. The findings highlight the importance of addressing behavioral factors in weight loss interventions for women, with a focus on promoting sustainable lifestyle changes and addressing emotional eating patterns.

The expression of HLA-DR and secretory component (SC) antigens and the presence of lymphocyte infiltration were evaluated in human gastric nonmalignant and malignant tissues using immunohistochemical techniques. A total of 70 gastric tissue samples, including 30 nonmalignant and 40 malignant samples, were examined. The expression of HLA-DR and SC antigens was significantly higher in the malignant tissues compared to the nonmalignant tissues (p<0.05). Lymphocyte infiltration was also significantly increased in the malignant tissues (p<0.001). Furthermore, a positive correlation was observed between the expression of HLA-DR and SC antigens and the level of lymphocyte infiltration in both nonmalignant and malignant tissues. These findings suggest that the upregulation of HLA-DR and SC antigens, along with increased lymphocyte infiltration, may play a role in the pathogenesis of gastric malignancies. Further studies are needed to elucidate the specific mechanisms underlying these observations and their potential clinical significance.",1
"Polypoid melanoma: a virulent variant of nodular melanoma. Polypoid melanoma is a rare and aggressive variant of nodular melanoma. It presents as a raised or dome-shaped lesion, often arising from a pre-existing pigmented mole. This study aimed to characterize the clinical and histopathological features of polypoid melanoma and compare them to nodular melanoma. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 50 cases of polypoid melanoma and 50 cases of nodular melanoma. Results showed that polypoid melanoma had a higher frequency of ulceration, mitotic rate, and tumor thickness compared to nodular melanoma. Additionally, polypoid melanoma exhibited a higher rate of lymph node metastasis and worse overall survival compared to nodular melanoma.

"A comparison of parallel versus perpendicular placement of retention sutures in abdominal wound closure.  A new technique for placement of retention sutures is described. Retention sutures are commonly used in abdominal wound closure to provide additional support and prevent wound dehiscence. Traditionally, these sutures are placed in a parallel fashion along the wound edges. However, it has been suggested that a perpendicular placement may offer better wound approximation and improved outcomes. This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of parallel versus perpendicular placement of retention sutures in abdominal wound closure. The study included a total of 100 patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery. The patients were randomly assigned to either the parallel or perpendicular group. Outcome measures included wound dehiscence rates, wound complications, and patient satisfaction. Preliminary results showed that the perpendicular group had significantly lower rates of wound dehiscence and complications compared to the parallel group. Additionally, patients in the perpendicular group reported higher satisfaction scores.

Further research is needed to confirm these results and explore the underlying mechanisms.",1
"Fibrillation potential amplitude and muscle atrophy following peripheral nerve injury. Peripheral nerve injury can lead to various complications, including muscle atrophy and alterations in muscle fiber properties. Fibrillation potential amplitude (FPA) has been proposed as a marker of muscle denervation and can provide valuable information about the extent of nerve injury. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between FPA and muscle atrophy following peripheral nerve injury. Twelve healthy male rats were randomly assigned to two groups: a control group and an experimental group subjected to sciatic nerve crush injury. Muscle biopsy samples were taken at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after injury, and FPA, muscle weight, and muscle fiber cross-sectional area were measured. The results showed a significant decrease in FPA and muscle weight in the experimental group compared to the control group at all time points. Muscle fiber cross-sectional area was also significantly reduced in the experimental group. These findings suggest that FPA can serve as a useful marker for assessing the extent of muscle denervation and subsequent muscle atrophy following peripheral nerve injury. Further research is needed to explore potential interventions to prevent or attenuate muscle atrophy in this context.",1
"Prevention of hypotension following spinal anaesthesia for elective caesarean section by wrapping of the legs.  Twenty-four parturients undergoing elective Caesarean section were allocated randomly to have the legs wrapped with elasticated Esmarch bandages immediately following spinal anaesthesia or to serve as controls. Hypotension is a common complication following spinal anesthesia for elective caesarean section. In this randomized controlled trial, we investigated whether wrapping the legs with elasticated Esmarch bandages could prevent hypotension in parturients undergoing elective caesarean section. Twenty-four parturients were included in the study, with half of them allocated to the intervention group and the other half serving as controls. The incidence of hypotension was significantly lower in the intervention group compared to the control group (25% vs. 83.3%). Furthermore, the mean decrease in systolic blood pressure was significantly less in the intervention group. These findings suggest that wrapping the legs with elasticated Esmarch bandages can effectively prevent hypotension following spinal anesthesia in elective caesarean section.",1
"The natural history of non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy.  Seventy one patients with non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy were studied retrospectively. The natural history of non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (NAION) is not well understood. In this retrospective study, we investigated the clinical course and visual outcomes of 71 patients diagnosed with NAION. The average follow-up period was 2.5 years.

Our findings revealed that over half of the patients experienced an initial improvement in visual acuity within the first month, followed by a gradual decline over time. At the final follow-up, only 30% of patients showed any improvement in visual acuity compared to their initial presentation.

We also observed that 36% of patients developed optic disc pallor during the follow-up period. This was associated with a worse prognosis for visual recovery. Additionally, 14% of patients developed NAION in the fellow eye during the study period, highlighting the potential risk of bilateral involvement.

Overall, our study provides valuable insights into the natural history of NAION and highlights the need for careful monitoring and management of patients with this condition. Further research is warranted to explore potential interventions that may improve visual outcomes in NAION.",1

In this study, we conducted an immunofluorescence examination of brain tissue from patients who died from cerebral malaria.

Using fluorescently labeled antibodies, we targeted specific cytokines and cell markers implicated in the inflammatory response and cellular damage associated with cerebral malaria. We observed pronounced staining for pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1β, in the endothelial cells of brain capillaries. Additionally, we identified infiltration of monocytes and macrophages in the brain parenchyma, along with evidence of apoptosis in neurons.

These findings provide valuable insights into the immunopathological mechanisms underlying cerebral malaria. Further exploration of these pathways may lead to the development of novel therapeutic interventions for this life-threatening condition.",1
"Diagnostic significance of carcinoembryonic antigen in the differential diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic significance of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels in the differential diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma. Serum samples from 60 patients with confirmed malignant mesothelioma, 30 patients with non-malignant asbestos-related diseases, and 30 healthy controls were analyzed for CEA levels. The mean CEA level in the malignant mesothelioma group was significantly higher compared to both the non-malignant asbestos-related disease group and the healthy control group (p<0.05). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that CEA had good diagnostic accuracy, with an area under the curve of 0.86 (p<0.001). Using a cutoff value of 5 ng/mL, CEA had a sensitivity of 78.3% and a specificity of 83.3% for the diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma. Our results suggest that CEA may serve as a valuable biomarker in the differential diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma, aiding in distinguishing it from non-malignant asbestos-related diseases. Further validation studies are warranted to confirm these findings.",1
"Epidermoid cyst (monodermal teratoma) of the testis. Epidermoid cysts, also known as monodermal teratomas, are rare benign tumors that can occur in various locations throughout the body, including the testis. We report a case of a 45-year-old male who presented with a painless, palpable mass in the right testis. Ultrasound imaging revealed a well-defined, hypoechoic lesion within the testis. Histopathological examination of the excised mass confirmed the diagnosis of an epidermoid cyst, showing a cystic structure lined by stratified squamous epithelium with keratin-filled cystic spaces. Immunohistochemical staining for germ cell markers was negative, ruling out the possibility of a teratoma. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course, and no evidence of recurrence was observed during the one-year follow-up period. This case highlights the importance of considering epidermoid cysts in the differential diagnosis of testicular masses, especially in older patients.",1
"Differentiation in embryonal neuroepithelial tumors of the central nervous system. Embryonal neuroepithelial tumors (ENTs) of the central nervous system (CNS) comprise a heterogeneous group of aggressive neoplasms that primarily affect children and young adults. This study aimed to investigate the differentiation patterns of ENTs in order to gain a better understanding of their pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets. Histopathological analysis of 62 ENT samples revealed distinct differentiation patterns, including neuroblastoma-like, medulloblastoma-like, and primitive neuroectodermal tumor-like features. Immunohistochemical staining further demonstrated the expression of various neural lineage markers, such as neurofilament protein, synaptophysin, and GFAP, indicating the multi-lineage differentiation potential of ENTs. Moreover, molecular profiling using next-generation sequencing identified recurrent genetic alterations in key genes, including PTEN, TP53, and MYC, suggesting their involvement in ENT tumorigenesis. These findings provide valuable insights into the differentiation heterogeneity of ENTs and highlight the potential for targeted therapies based on specific molecular alterations. Further studies are needed to validate these findings and develop tailored treatment strategies for patients with ENTs.",1
"Immunohistochemical demonstration of the placental form of glutathione S-transferase, a detoxifying enzyme in human gliomas. This study aimed to investigate the presence and localization of the placental form of glutathione S-transferase (GSTP), an important detoxifying enzyme, in human gliomas. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on tissue sections from glioma patients using specific antibodies against GSTP. The results revealed that GSTP was expressed in glioma cells in a heterogeneous manner, with strong immunoreactivity observed in some tumor areas and little to no expression in others. Importantly, GSTP was predominantly located in the cytoplasm of glioma cells. The expression levels of GSTP were found to be significantly higher in high-grade gliomas compared to low-grade gliomas. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between GSTP expression and tumor proliferative activity, as indicated by Ki-67 staining. These findings suggest that GSTP may play a role in the detoxification process within gliomas and that its expression levels could potentially serve as a prognostic marker for glioma malignancy. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the exact mechanisms by which GSTP contributes to glioma biology and its potential as a therapeutic target.",1

"Homeobox gene expression plus autocrine growth factor production elicits myeloid leukemia.  In the murine myelomonocytic leukemia WEHI-3B, proviral insertions have induced expression of the Hox-2. To investigate the role of homeobox gene expression and autocrine growth factor production in myeloid leukemia, we studied the murine myelomonocytic leukemia WEHI-3B model. We found that proviral insertions in this model led to the activation and overexpression of the homeobox gene Hox-2. This overexpression prompted the production of autocrine growth factors, which further enhanced leukemic cell proliferation and survival. Inhibition of the Hox-2 gene expression resulted in decreased autocrine growth factor production and reduced leukemia cell growth and survival. These findings suggest that the induction of homeobox gene expression and subsequent autocrine growth factor production play a critical role in the development and progression of myeloid leukemia. Targeting these pathways may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of this malignancy. Further studies are warranted to explore the translational potential of these findings.",1
"Alteration of platelet serotonin in patients with chronic tension-type headache during cold pressor test.

"Misdiagnosis of the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome due to hyperlipidemia. We report a case of misdiagnosis of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) due to hyperlipidemia. A 42-year-old male presented with recurrent abdominal pain, weight loss, and diarrhea. Initial clinical evaluation suggested ZES, and fasting serum gastrin levels were significantly elevated. However, further investigations revealed coexisting hyperlipidemia, which can interfere with serum gastrin assays and mimic the elevated levels seen in ZES. Lipid-lowering therapy was initiated, and follow-up gastrin levels returned to normal. This case highlights the importance of considering hyperlipidemia as a potential confounder in the diagnosis of ZES and the need for careful interpretation of gastrin levels in patients with coexisting metabolic abnormalities. Clinicians should be cautious in attributing symptoms solely to ZES based on elevated gastrin levels and should consider comprehensive evaluation to avoid misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment.",1
"Heart transplantation in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension and increased pulmonary vascular resistance.  Irreversibly increased pulmonary vascular resistance is a contraindication for cardiac transplantation. Patients with severe pulmonary hypertension and increased pulmonary vascular resistance often face limited treatment options, as cardiac transplantation is contraindicated in these cases. We present a case series of three patients with severe pulmonary hypertension who underwent successful heart transplantation despite the presence of irreversibly increased pulmonary vascular resistance. Preoperative evaluation using invasive hemodynamic monitoring and lung perfusion scans revealed severe pulmonary vascular disease in all patients. However, aggressive medical management including the use of prostacyclin analogs and endothelin receptor antagonists was initiated to optimize hemodynamics and reduce right ventricular strain. Following extensive multidisciplinary discussion and careful patient selection, the patients underwent heart transplantation with meticulous intraoperative management to minimize pulmonary vascular injury. Postoperative outcomes were favorable, with no evidence of right heart failure or acute rejection. Our experience suggests that selected patients with severe pulmonary hypertension and increased pulmonary vascular resistance may be suitable for heart transplantation with careful preoperative evaluation and optimization of medical management.",1
"Epidemiology of acute respiratory tract infections among Guatemalan ambulatory preschool children.  Acute respiratory tract infections (ARI) were studied during a 2-year period in 521 preschool children living in a marginal area of Guatemala City. The aim of this study was to determine the epidemiology of acute respiratory tract infections (ARI) among ambulatory preschool children in Guatemala. A total of 521 children living in a marginal area of Guatemala City were included in the study over a 2-year period. ARI episodes were identified based on clinical symptoms and confirmed by laboratory testing for respiratory pathogens. The overall incidence rate of ARI was found to be 3.6 episodes per child-year, with peaks occurring during the rainy season. The most common pathogens identified were respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Risk factors for ARI included younger age, lower socioeconomic status, and exposure to tobacco smoke. The study also found a high prevalence of malnutrition among the children, which was associated with an increased risk of ARI. These findings highlight the significant burden of ARI among Guatemalan preschool children and emphasize the need for targeted interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with ARI in this population.",1
"Dacron fabric-enveloped hydroxyapatite prosthesis for sternal tumor defect: an autopsy report. This autopsy report presents a case of a 58-year-old male who underwent resection of a sternal tumor using a Dacron fabric-enveloped hydroxyapatite prosthesis. The patient had a history of local recurrence of a primary sternal chondrosarcoma, which necessitated a wide resection of the sternum. The defect was then reconstructed using the Dacron fabric-enveloped hydroxyapatite prosthesis.

At autopsy, the prosthesis was found to be well-integrated within the surrounding tissues without evidence of infection or displacement. Microscopic examination revealed a fibrous capsule surrounding the prosthesis with evidence of foreign body giant cell reaction. Formation of woven bone and remodeling of the hydroxyapatite granules were observed within the prosthesis. These findings indicate successful incorporation and biocompatibility of the prosthesis.

Overall, this case demonstrates the utility and effectiveness of the Dacron fabric-enveloped hydroxyapatite prosthesis for reconstruction of sternal defects. Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term outcomes and complications associated with this surgical technique.",1
"Recovery of CD3+ and CD5- lymphocyte subpopulation after autologous bone marrow transplantation and chemotherapy. The recovery of CD3+ and CD5- lymphocyte subpopulation after autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and chemotherapy was investigated in 30 patients with hematologic malignancies. Flow cytometry analysis was used to assess the levels of CD3+ and CD5- lymphocytes at various time points after BMT and chemotherapy. 

The results showed that the levels of CD3+ lymphocytes gradually increased over time, with a median time of 30 days for recovery to normal levels. In contrast, the recovery of CD5- lymphocytes was delayed, with a median time of 60 days for recovery to normal levels. Additionally, the recovery of CD3+ lymphocytes was significantly faster than the recovery of CD5- lymphocytes (p<0.05).

These findings suggest that the recovery of CD3+ and CD5- lymphocyte subpopulations occurs at different rates after autologous BMT and chemotherapy. Monitoring the levels of these lymphocyte subsets may provide important information about immune reconstitution and prognosis in patients undergoing these treatments. Further studies are warranted to explore the clinical implications of these findings.",1
"MRI findings in neuro-Behcet's disease. Neuro-Behcet's disease (NBD) is a rare inflammatory disorder affecting the central nervous system. However, little is known about the specific MRI findings in this condition. This retrospective study aimed to describe the characteristic MRI features of NBD. A total of 25 NBD patients were included, and MRI scans were analyzed by two experienced neuroradiologists. The most common finding was multifocal white matter lesions (92%), followed by brainstem involvement (56%) and cranial nerve enhancement (52%). These findings suggest that NBD primarily affects the white matter and can involve the brainstem and cranial nerves. Understanding the MRI patterns in NBD can aid in its early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, leading to improved patient outcomes. Further prospective studies are needed to validate these findings.",1
"Dysgeusia, gustatory sweating, and crocodile tears syndrome induced by a cerebellopontine angle meningioma. We present a case of a 52-year-old female who developed dysgeusia, gustatory sweating, and crocodile tears syndrome (CTS) as a result of a cerebellopontine angle meningioma. The patient initially presented with altered taste sensation, primarily experiencing a metallic taste in her mouth. She also noticed sweating on the affected side of her face during meals. A diagnosis of dysgeusia and gustatory sweating was made, and further investigation revealed a tumor in the cerebellopontine angle. Surgical resection of the meningioma was performed, and postoperative recovery was uneventful. Subsequently, the patient developed CTS, experiencing lacrimation during meals. CTS was managed through conservative measures, including the use of anticholinergic eye drops and counseling regarding mealtime strategies. This case highlights the rare association between a cerebellopontine angle meningioma and the development of dysgeusia, gustatory sweating, and CTS. Awareness of these symptoms can aid in the early detection and management of underlying pathology.",1
"Islet cell carcinoma of the pancreas presenting as bleeding from isolated gastric varices.  Report of a case and review of the literature. Islet cell carcinoma of the pancreas is a rare neuroendocrine tumor that can present with various symptoms. We report a case of a 55-year-old male who presented with sudden onset of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Endoscopic examination revealed isolated gastric varices, which were successfully treated with endoscopic variceal band ligation. Further investigations, including computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, identified a mass in the pancreas consistent with islet cell carcinoma. The patient underwent surgical resection of the tumor with subsequent adjuvant chemotherapy. Islet cell carcinoma causing bleeding from isolated gastric varices is an extremely rare presentation, with only a few cases reported in the literature. Clinicians should consider this diagnosis in patients presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding and investigate further for underlying pancreatic pathology.",1

"Evidence of heterogeneous mechanisms in lipoprotein lipid alterations in hyperandrogenic women. Women with hyperandrogenism often exhibit lipid abnormalities, including dyslipidemia and high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). However, the mechanisms underlying these lipid alterations remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the presence of heterogeneous mechanisms contributing to lipoprotein lipid abnormalities in hyperandrogenic women. A total of 82 hyperandrogenic women, diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or non-classical adrenal hyperplasia (NCAH), were recruited. Lipid profiles were assessed, including total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), LDL-C, and apolipoprotein B (apoB) levels. Furthermore, genetic mutations in relevant lipoprotein metabolism genes were analyzed. Our results revealed distinct patterns of lipid abnormalities in hyperandrogenic women, suggesting heterogeneous mechanisms. While some individuals exhibited elevated LDL-C levels, others had elevated triglycerides or low HDL-C levels. Genetic mutations in lipoprotein metabolism genes were observed in a subset of patients, further supporting the idea of varying etiologies for lipid abnormalities in hyperandrogenic women. These findings provide valuable insights into the complexity of lipid alterations in this population and emphasize the importance of individualized approaches to diagnosis and treatment.",1
"Brain abscess associated with congenital pulmonary arteriovenous fistula. Brain abscess is a serious condition that can result in significant morbidity and mortality if not promptly diagnosed and treated. We report a case of a brain abscess in a patient with a previously undiagnosed congenital pulmonary arteriovenous fistula (PAVF). PAVF is a rare vascular anomaly that causes an abnormal direct communication between pulmonary arteries and veins. This case highlights the importance of considering PAVF as a potential underlying cause of brain abscess, especially in patients without any identifiable risk factors. Prompt diagnosis and management of PAVF, including embolization of the abnormal vessel, can prevent further complications such as recurrent abscess formation. Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for PAVF in patients presenting with brain abscess, particularly in the absence of other predisposing factors.",1
"Impaired awareness of behavioral limitations after traumatic brain injury.  Sixty-four traumatically brain injured patients were divided into three groups. The aim of this study was to investigate the impaired awareness of behavioral limitations in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Sixty-four TBI patients were categorized into three groups based on their level of awareness: intact awareness (Group A, n=22), partial awareness (Group B, n=24), and impaired awareness (Group C, n=18). Cognitive and behavioral assessments were performed using standardized neuropsychological tests and rating scales. The results revealed that patients in Group C had significantly lower cognitive function and displayed more severe behavioral limitations compared to the other two groups. Furthermore, impaired awareness was associated with poorer functional outcomes and increased caregiver burden. These findings emphasize the importance of assessing awareness levels in TBI patients and developing interventions to improve insight into behavioral limitations, which could potentially enhance treatment outcomes and promote independence in daily functioning.",1
"Beneficial effects of colestipol-niacin on coronary atherosclerosis.  A 4-year follow-up. This study aimed to investigate the long-term effects of colestipol-niacin treatment on coronary atherosclerosis. The study included 120 patients with established coronary artery disease who were randomly assigned to receive either colestipol-niacin treatment or placebo. Coronary angiography was performed at baseline and after 4 years to assess the progression of atherosclerosis. The primary endpoint was the change in the percent diameter stenosis (%DS) of the coronary arteries. Secondary endpoints included changes in minimal luminal diameter (MLD) and the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE). 

After 4 years, the colestipol-niacin group showed a significant reduction in %DS compared to the placebo group (p<0.001). The MLD was also significantly increased in the colestipol-niacin group (p=0.002). Furthermore, the incidence of MACE was lower in the colestipol-niacin group, although this difference did not reach statistical significance (p=0.076). 

In conclusion, colestipol-niacin treatment was associated with a favorable effect on coronary atherosclerosis, as evidenced by a reduction in %DS and an increase in MLD. These findings support the use of colestipol-niacin in the management of coronary artery disease. Further studies are warranted to assess its long-term efficacy and safety.",1
"Mechanism of intermittent preexcitation in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. The Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is characterized by the presence of an aberrant electrical pathway between the atria and ventricles, known as an accessory pathway. This pathway bypasses the normal conduction system, resulting in rapid conduction of impulses from the atria to the ventricles, causing preexcitation. However, the mechanism of intermittent preexcitation in WPW syndrome remains unclear. In this study, we sought to investigate the mechanism of intermittent preexcitation by analyzing electrocardiograms (ECGs) of patients with WPW syndrome. We found that intermittent preexcitation was primarily caused by changes in the refractory period of the accessory pathway. During periods of preexcitation, the refractory period of the accessory pathway was significantly shorter, allowing for rapid conduction. Conversely, during periods of normal conduction, the refractory period was longer, preventing conduction through the accessory pathway. Our findings suggest that the mechanism of intermittent preexcitation in WPW syndrome is primarily related to alterations in the refractory period of the accessory pathway. Further studies are warranted to explore potential therapeutic strategies targeting this mechanism.",1
"The reproducibility of intravascular ultrasound imaging in vitro. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging has become an essential tool in assessing and guiding interventions for coronary artery disease. However, the reproducibility of IVUS measurements is crucial for accurate interpretation of data and clinical decision making. This study aimed to evaluate the reproducibility of IVUS imaging in vitro. We performed multiple IVUS scans on 10 randomly selected human cadaveric coronary arteries using a commercially available IVUS system. Several measurements, including lumen diameter, plaque burden, and minimal lumen area, were obtained from each scan. Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the agreement between repeated measurements. The results demonstrated excellent reproducibility for all IVUS measurements, with intraclass correlation coefficients ranging from 0.87 to 0.98. These findings support the reliability of IVUS imaging in providing consistent and accurate measurements, further enhancing its utility in clinical practice.",1
"Window operation: an alternative treatment method for Bartholin gland cysts and abscesses Recently, we developed the ""window operation"" as a more effective way to treat Bartholin gland cysts and abscesses. Bartholin gland cysts and abscesses are common benign gynecologic conditions that can cause significant discomfort and morbidity in women. The current treatment options, such as incision and drainage or marsupialization, have limitations in terms of recurrence rates and patient satisfaction. In this study, we propose the ""window operation"" as a novel and more effective treatment method for Bartholin gland cysts and abscesses. The procedure involves creating a small window in the cyst wall to allow continuous drainage and prevent reaccumulation of fluid. We present a series of cases in which the window operation was successfully performed, leading to improved symptom relief and reduced recurrence rates compared to traditional treatment methods. This innovative approach shows promise in addressing the unmet needs of women suffering from Bartholin gland cysts and abscesses.",1
"Hepatitis B virus nucleocapsid/pre-S2 fusion proteins expressed in attenuated Salmonella for oral vaccination.  Hybrid HBV nucleocapsid-pre-S(2) fusion proteins were stably expressed in several aromatic-dependent attenuated Salmonella typhimurium and Salmonella dublin strains. The development of an effective oral vaccine against Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is necessary for widespread immunization. In this study, we engineered attenuated strains of Salmonella typhimurium and Salmonella dublin to express hybrid HBV nucleocapsid-pre-S2 fusion proteins. These fusion proteins were stable and successfully expressed in the attenuated Salmonella strains. The expression of the nucleocapsid-pre-S2 fusion proteins was confirmed through Western blot analysis. Furthermore, oral vaccination of mice with these engineered Salmonella strains resulted in the induction of specific immune responses against HBV. These findings suggest that the use of attenuated Salmonella strains as delivery vehicles for HBV fusion proteins may be a promising strategy for the development of an effective oral vaccine against HBV infection.",1
"Lateral medullary infarction: prognosis in an unselected series.  We describe the acute and long-term prognosis in 43 patients with lateral medullary infarction (LMI) collected from a population-based stroke registry from 1982 to July 1988. Lateral medullary infarction (LMI), also known as Wallenberg syndrome, is a rare but significant cause of stroke. In this study, we aim to determine the acute and long-term prognosis of LMI in an unselected series of 43 patients. Data was collected from a population-based stroke registry from 1982 to July 1988. Our findings indicate that patients with LMI have a varied prognosis, with some experiencing significant recovery while others facing persistent disabilities. Factors such as age, extent of infarction, and the presence of comorbidities were found to be associated with prognosis. These findings contribute to the understanding of LMI and can aid clinicians in prognosticating and managing patients with this condition.",1
"Why are autism and the fragile-X syndrome associated? Conceptual and methodological issues. The association between autism and Fragile-X syndrome has been well established; however, the underlying reasons for this correlation remain unclear. This paper explores both conceptual and methodological issues regarding this association. Conceptually, researchers have speculated that common genetic and neurobiological factors contribute to the development of both disorders. Methodologically, challenges arise in accurately diagnosing autism in individuals with Fragile-X syndrome, as the cognitive and behavioral symptoms of Fragile-X can mask or mimic those of autism. Furthermore, studying this association requires large sample sizes and appropriate control groups. Despite these challenges, understanding the relationship between autism and Fragile-X syndrome is crucial for improving diagnosis and treatment strategies for individuals with either condition. Further research should focus on elucidating the shared mechanisms underlying these disorders.",1
"The modified superior based pharyngeal flap. The modified superior based pharyngeal flap is a surgical technique used in the treatment of velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) and related speech disorders. VPI is a condition characterized by the incomplete closure of the velopharyngeal port during speech production, leading to nasal air escape and abnormal speech resonance. The traditional superior pharyngeal flap has been the gold standard for the surgical management of VPI, but it is associated with complications such as obstructive sleep apnea and hypernasal speech. The modified superior based pharyngeal flap is a modification of the traditional technique that aims to reduce these complications. This abstract reviews the surgical technique, indications, outcomes, and complications associated with the modified superior based pharyngeal flap in the treatment of VPI. Further research is needed to evaluate the long-term outcomes and compare this technique with other surgical approaches for VPI management.",1
"Upper gastrointestinal pathology in familial adenomatous polyposis: results from a prospective study of 102 patients.  Multiple gastric and duodenal biopsy specimens from 102 asymptomatic patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, taken during a prospective endoscopic screening programme were examined. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by the development of numerous adenomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract. While colorectal cancer is the most common malignancy associated with FAP, upper gastrointestinal (GI) pathology has also been reported. In this prospective study, we examined multiple gastric and duodenal biopsy specimens from 102 asymptomatic FAP patients as part of an endoscopic screening program. Histopathological analysis revealed varying degrees of gastric and duodenal inflammation, ranging from mild to severe. Gastric adenomas and duodenal adenomas were identified in 14% and 10% of patients, respectively. Additionally, gastric hyperplastic polyps were found in 23% of patients. Our findings suggest that upper GI pathology is common in FAP patients, emphasizing the importance of regular endoscopic screening in these individuals to detect and manage potential neoplastic changes. Further studies are warranted to determine the optimal management and surveillance strategies for upper GI pathology in FAP.",1
"Influence of otitis media on the correlation between rectal and auditory canal temperatures.  In a noninterventional, controlled, single-blinded trial, 251 children were examined in a university hospital emergency department setting to study the influence of acute otitis media on the relationship between rectal and auditory canal temperatures. The accuracy of measuring body temperature is crucial in diagnosing and managing various medical conditions. In this study, we aimed to investigate the influence of acute otitis media, a common childhood infection, on the correlation between rectal and auditory canal temperatures. A total of 251 children were enrolled in a noninterventional, controlled, single-blinded trial conducted in a university hospital emergency department. The results show a significant difference in temperatures between children with and without acute otitis media. Specifically, the correlation between rectal and auditory canal temperatures was significantly lower in children with acute otitis media compared to those without. These findings suggest that the presence of acute otitis media may distort the accuracy of temperature measurements, highlighting the importance of considering this factor when assessing patients with suspected infection or inflammation.",1

"Recurrence rate after discontinuation of long-term mebendazole therapy in alveolar echinococcosis (preliminary results).  The recurrence rate was investigated in 19 patients with non-resectable alveolar echinococcosis after discontinuation of a long-term therapy with mebendazole (average treatment 4. 7 years). Patients were followed up for a mean duration of 2.3 years after stopping mebendazole treatment. Recurrence of alveolar echinococcosis was assessed using radiological and serological parameters. Out of the 19 patients, 6 (31.6%) experienced recurrence of the disease. The median time to recurrence was 1.8 years. Recurrence was observed in both patients who received adjuvant treatment after discontinuation of mebendazole and those who did not. There was no significant difference in the recurrence rate between patients who received a longer duration of mebendazole therapy (≥5 years) and those who received a shorter duration (<5 years). These preliminary results suggest that there is a considerable risk of recurrence after discontinuation of long-term mebendazole therapy in patients with non-resectable alveolar echinococcosis.",1

"Increase in native valve endocarditis caused by coagulase negative staphylococci: an Anglo-French clinical and microbiological study. Native valve endocarditis (NVE) caused by coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS) has been increasing in frequency, posing a challenge in diagnosis and management. This study aims to evaluate the clinical and microbiological characteristics of NVE caused by CoNS in Anglo-French patients. 

A multicenter retrospective analysis was performed on patients diagnosed with NVE caused by CoNS between 2010 and 2020. Clinical data, echocardiographic findings, and microbiological profiles were collected and analyzed. 

A total of 105 cases were included, with a significant increase observed over the study period. CoNS was the leading cause of NVE in 28% of cases, surpassing other pathogens. Patients with CoNS-related NVE were more likely to have previous cardiac device implantation and healthcare-associated infections. 

Microbiological analysis revealed a high proportion of methicillin resistance among CoNS isolates, emphasizing the importance of antibiotic susceptibility testing. Additionally, the presence of multiple CoNS species in a single patient was observed in a substantial number of cases, suggesting potential polymicrobial infections. 

In conclusion, NVE caused by CoNS is on the rise, particularly in patients with cardiac device implantation. A comprehensive understanding of the clinical and microbiological characteristics of CoNS-related NVE is crucial for appropriate management and antimicrobial stewardship.",1
"Endoscopic laser surgery.  A single-center comprehensive experience. Endoscopic laser surgery is a commonly performed procedure for various medical conditions. In this retrospective study, we aimed to assess the outcomes and complications associated with endoscopic laser surgery in a single-center setting. A total of 256 patients who underwent endoscopic laser surgery between 2010 and 2018 were included in the analysis. The majority of patients (68.8%) had benign conditions, while the remaining had malignant or premalignant lesions. The overall success rate of endoscopic laser surgery was 89.8%, with a low complication rate of 6.3%. Notably, patients with malignant lesions had a higher complication rate compared to those with benign conditions (9.7% vs 5.1%).

Further research is needed to validate these findings in larger cohorts.",1
"T cell subsets (Tc, Th, Ts, Tsi) and IL2 receptor-bearing cells in peripheral blood of patients in the acute phase of alcoholic hepatitis. Alcoholic hepatitis is a severe and potentially life-threatening condition associated with chronic alcohol abuse. Immune dysfunction plays a key role in the pathogenesis of this disease, but the specific alterations in T cell subsets and IL2 receptor-bearing cells in these patients remain poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the peripheral blood levels of T cell subsets (Tc, Th, Ts, Tsi) and IL2 receptor-bearing cells in patients with acute alcoholic hepatitis. Peripheral blood samples were collected from 78 patients with acute alcoholic hepatitis and 40 healthy controls. Flow cytometry analysis showed that patients with alcoholic hepatitis had significantly lower levels of Tc cells, Th cells, and Tsi cells compared to healthy controls. In contrast, the levels of Ts cells were significantly increased in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. Furthermore, IL2 receptor-bearing cells were significantly decreased in patients with alcoholic hepatitis compared to healthy controls. These findings suggest that alterations in T cell subsets and IL2 receptor-bearing cells may contribute to the immune dysfunction observed in patients with alcoholic hepatitis, providing potential targets for future therapeutic interventions.",1
"Internuclear ophthalmoplegia in the Chiari type II malformation. Chiari type II malformation is a congenital condition characterized by herniation of the cerebellar vermis and brainstem through the foramen magnum. While the majority of patients with Chiari type II malformation present with neurological symptoms such as hydrocephalus and spasticity, less common manifestations have also been reported. We describe the case of a 15-year-old female with Chiari type II malformation who presented with acute onset internuclear ophthalmoplegia. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated tonsillar herniation and brainstem compression, confirming the diagnosis. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of internuclear ophthalmoplegia as the initial manifestation of Chiari type II malformation. This case highlights the importance of considering Chiari malformation in the differential diagnosis of internuclear ophthalmoplegia, especially in pediatric patients.

"Radiation therapy for intraductal carcinoma.  Is it an equal alternative? Of 213 consecutive patients with intraductal carcinoma, 109 were selectively treated with mastectomy and 104 with radiation therapy. This retrospective study aimed to compare the effectiveness of mastectomy versus radiation therapy as treatment options for intraductal carcinoma. A total of 213 patients diagnosed with intraductal carcinoma were included in the study, with 109 patients undergoing mastectomy and 104 patients receiving radiation therapy.

Overall, both treatment modalities were found to be effective in the management of intraductal carcinoma. The mastectomy group had a significantly lower recurrence rate compared to the radiation therapy group (p<0.05). However, the radiation therapy group had a higher rate of breast preservation, with a substantial proportion of patients achieving excellent cosmetic outcomes.

Further analysis revealed that patients with larger tumor sizes and higher nuclear grades had better outcomes with mastectomy, while those with smaller tumor sizes and lower nuclear grades had comparable outcomes with radiation therapy.

In conclusion, while mastectomy appears to provide a lower risk of recurrence in patients with intraductal carcinoma, radiation therapy can be considered as an equivalent alternative, especially for patients with smaller tumor sizes and lower nuclear grades, allowing for breast preservation and favorable cosmetic outcomes.",1

"The use of molecular probes to distinguish new primary tumors from recurrent tumors in gynecologic malignancies. In gynecologic malignancies, distinguishing new primary tumors from recurrent tumors can be challenging. We aimed to evaluate the use of molecular probes in this context. We conducted a retrospective study including patients with gynecologic malignancies who underwent surgical resection of their tumors and subsequent molecular analysis. Molecular probes targeting specific genetic alterations were used to detect tumor-specific mutations. Our results showed that molecular probes were able to accurately differentiate between new primary tumors and recurrent tumors in the majority of cases. This approach demonstrated a high sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing between these two entities, which can guide treatment decisions and improve patient outcomes. Therefore, molecular probes represent a valuable tool in the management of gynecologic malignancies.",1
"Reinforcement of incontinent stools in the treatment of encopresis. Encopresis, the involuntary passage of feces in inappropriate places, is a common problem in children. We investigated the efficacy of reinforcing incontinent stools in the treatment of encopresis. Twenty-five children diagnosed with encopresis were randomly assigned to either the intervention group or the control group. The intervention group received reinforcement of incontinent stools through a reward system, while the control group received standard care. After six weeks of treatment, the intervention group showed a significant decrease in the frequency of incontinent stools compared to the control group. These findings suggest that reinforcing incontinent stools may be an effective strategy in the treatment of encopresis. Further studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to validate these results.",1

Pulse oximeters are widely used in medical practice for non-invasive measurement of oxygen saturation in arterial blood. However, their accuracy can be compromised under certain circumstances, such as low arterial pressure. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the accuracy of different pulse oximeters at low arterial pressure in healthy volunteers. A total of 50 participants were recruited and subjected to stepwise reduction of arterial pressure using a blood pressure cuff. Oxygen saturation measurements were simultaneously obtained from four pulse oximeters, and compared to invasive arterial blood gas analysis. The results showed significant differences in accuracy among the tested pulse oximeters, with some devices displaying greater deviations at low arterial pressure. These findings highlight the importance of considering the specific limitations of pulse oximeters in clinical practice, particularly in patients with low blood pressure.",1
"Ovarian granulosa-stromal cell tumors are characterized by trisomy 12. Ovarian granulosa-stromal cell tumors (OGSCTs) are rare neoplasms that arise from the sex cord-stromal cells of the ovary. They are known to exhibit a spectrum of histological features and clinical behavior. In recent years, genetic studies have shed light on the molecular alterations involved in the pathogenesis of these tumors. One recurrent finding is the presence of trisomy 12 in a subset of OGSCTs. Trisomy 12 refers to the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 12 in the tumor cells. This chromosomal abnormality has been implicated in the overexpression of specific genes and dysregulation of signaling pathways, which may contribute to the development and progression of OGSCTs. Further research is warranted to investigate the clinical significance of trisomy 12 and its potential as a diagnostic or prognostic marker in OGSCTs.",1
"Pharmacodynamics in cancer therapy. Pharmacodynamics, the study of the effects of drugs on the body, plays a crucial role in cancer therapy. This abstract aims to provide an overview of the pharmacodynamic principles and strategies used in cancer treatment. 

Cancer is a complex and heterogeneous disease characterized by uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation. Pharmacodynamic interventions in cancer therapy target various pathways involved in cell signaling, DNA replication, and cell cycle progression. These interventions aim to induce cell death, inhibit tumor growth, and prevent metastasis. 

Different classes of drugs, such as cytotoxic agents, hormonal therapies, immunotherapies, and targeted therapies, have been developed to selectively target cancer cells or disrupt their microenvironment. Pharmacodynamic studies in cancer therapy evaluate drug efficacy, mechanisms of action, dose-response relationships, and drug interactions. 

Understanding the pharmacodynamics of anticancer drugs is crucial for optimizing treatment regimens, minimizing toxicity, and improving patient outcomes. By tailoring treatment strategies based on individual patient characteristics, pharmacodynamics plays a vital role in personalized cancer therapy.",1
"Delayed presentation of intrapericardial diaphragmatic hernia, an unusual cause of colon obstruction. Intrapericardial diaphragmatic hernia (IDH) is a rare form of diaphragmatic hernia, characterized by the herniation of abdominal organs into the pericardial sac. Here, we report a case of delayed presentation of IDH causing colon obstruction in a 62-year-old male patient.

Shwachman syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, skeletal abnormalities, and bone marrow dysfunction. This study aimed to investigate the psychological characteristics of children with Shwachman syndrome. Twenty children (aged 6-16 years) diagnosed with Shwachman syndrome were included in the study. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition (WISC-IV) was used to assess their cognitive abilities, and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) was used to evaluate their behavioral and emotional problems. Results showed that children with Shwachman syndrome had significantly lower mean scores on all WISC-IV indexes compared to the general population. Moreover, they exhibited a higher prevalence of externalizing and internalizing problems as assessed by the CBCL. Specifically, attention problems, aggressive behavior, and social problems were the most commonly reported behavioral difficulties. These findings highlight the need for comprehensive psychological assessment and support for children with Shwachman syndrome to optimize their overall well-being and quality of life.",1
"Murine erythroleukemia cell line GM979 contains factors that can activate silent chromosomal human gamma-globin genes. Murine erythroleukemia cell line GM979 has been shown to contain factors that possess the ability to activate silent chromosomal human gamma-globin genes. In order to evaluate the potential therapeutic application of these factors in patients with beta-thalassemia or sickle cell disease, further investigation is necessary. The aim of this study was to determine the specific factors within GM979 cells that are responsible for the activation of gamma-globin genes and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved. Through a series of experiments, we identified a soluble factor secreted by GM979 cells that can induce upregulation of gamma-globin gene expression in both erythroid and non-erythroid cells. Furthermore, we found that this factor acts through the binding of specific transcription factors to the gamma-globin gene promoter region, leading to its activation. These findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying gamma-globin gene regulation and offer potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of beta-hemoglobinopathies.",1
"Access to cancer prevention, detection, and treatment. Cancer continues to be a major global health concern, with millions of individuals being diagnosed with this disease each year. Access to cancer prevention, detection, and treatment plays a crucial role in reducing cancer-related morbidity and mortality. This abstract aims to highlight the importance of ensuring equitable access to cancer services.

Limited access to cancer prevention strategies, such as vaccinations against human papillomavirus (HPV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV), can contribute to higher cancer incidence rates. Additionally, barriers to cancer screening, including lack of awareness, financial constraints, and inadequate healthcare infrastructure, hinder early detection and timely interventions. Furthermore, disparities in access to high-quality cancer treatment options, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, often disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, leading to poorer outcomes.

Efforts to address these disparities must prioritize a multi-faceted approach. This includes increasing public awareness about cancer and its risk factors, implementing comprehensive screening programs, strengthening healthcare infrastructure to provide timely and accessible diagnostic and treatment services, and advocating for policy changes that promote equitable access to cancer care. These interventions can significantly contribute to reducing the burden of cancer worldwide.",1
"Point mutation in the exoplasmic domain of the erythropoietin receptor resulting in hormone-independent activation and tumorigenicity. This study reports a point mutation in the exoplasmic domain of the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) that leads to hormone-independent activation and tumorigenicity. The mutation was identified in a patient with polycythemia vera, a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by excessive production of red blood cells. Molecular analysis revealed a missense mutation, resulting in the substitution of a proline residue with a histidine residue at position 225 of the EPOR protein. Functional assays demonstrated that the mutant EPOR exhibited constitutive activation and promoted cell proliferation even in the absence of erythropoietin stimulation. Moreover, in vivo studies using a mouse xenograft model showed that expression of the mutant EPOR in hematopoietic stem cells resulted in the formation of erythroid tumors. These findings provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of polycythemia vera and suggest potential therapeutic targets for this disease. Further research is warranted to explore the clinical implications and therapeutic possibilities of targeting this mutant EPOR in the treatment of polycythemia vera.",1
"How selective is selective posterior rhizotomy? Although selective posterior rhizotomy has become an increasingly utilized surgical treatment for spasticity, the procedure is unstandardized and is performed differently at various medical centers. Selective posterior rhizotomy (SPR) is a surgical procedure commonly used for the management of spasticity in patients with cerebral palsy. Although its popularity has grown, there remains a lack of standardization in the technique across different medical centers. This study aimed to evaluate the selectivity of SPR and determine the factors influencing its selectivity.

A retrospective analysis was conducted on a cohort of patients who underwent SPR for spasticity management. The degree of selectivity achieved by each surgeon was assessed by measuring the postoperative reduction in electromyographic activity of target muscles. Additionally, factors such as patient age, spasticity severity, and surgeon experience were analyzed to identify potential predictors of selectivity.

The results demonstrated significant variability in selectivity among surgeons, with a wide range of electromyographic reductions observed. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that surgeon experience and spasticity severity were the most influential factors affecting selectivity. Patient age did not significantly impact the degree of selectivity achieved.

In conclusion, while SPR is an effective treatment modality for spasticity, the level of selectivity can vary widely among surgeons. Standardization of the technique and further research into refining the surgical approach are necessary to improve patient outcomes and ensure consistent results across medical centers.",1
"An objective score to predict upper tract deterioration in myelodysplasia.  Bladder dysfunction in myelodysplasia may present a significant hazard to the upper tract and a threat to kidney function. This study aimed to develop an objective scoring system to predict upper tract deterioration in patients with myelodysplasia. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 102 patients with myelodysplasia who underwent urodynamic testing and renal function assessment. Multiple variables including age, gender, bladder capacity, maximum detrusor pressure, and presence of detrusor sphincter dyssynergia were analyzed to identify factors associated with upper tract deterioration. Using logistic regression analysis, a scoring system was developed. The scoring system demonstrated good discrimination and calibration, with an area under the curve of 0.87. Patients with a higher score were found to have a significantly increased risk of upper tract deterioration. This objective scoring system may aid in identifying individuals at higher risk of upper tract deterioration and guide appropriate management strategies to preserve kidney function in myelodysplasia.",1
"Cerebrospinal fluid eicosanoid levels: endogenous PGD2 and LTC4 synthesis by antigen-presenting cells that migrate to the central nervous system. This study aimed to investigate the synthesis of endogenous prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) and leukotriene C4 (LTC4) by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that migrate to the central nervous system (CNS), using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) eicosanoid levels as an indicator. CSF samples were collected from patients with CNS inflammation, and the presence of PGD2 and LTC4 was assessed using enzyme immunoassay. The results showed significantly elevated levels of both PGD2 and LTC4 in CSF samples. Further analysis revealed that APCs present in CSF were responsible for the production of these eicosanoids. This suggests that APCs in the CNS play a role in the local synthesis of PGD2 and LTC4, potentially contributing to the inflammation and immune response in the central nervous system.",1

The study demonstrates that meropenem has good penetration into inflammatory exudates, suggesting its potential efficacy in treating infections associated with such exudates.",1
"Granulomatous prostatitis and poorly differentiated prostate carcinoma. Granulomatous prostatitis (GP) and poorly differentiated prostate carcinoma (PDPC) are two distinct conditions that can present with similar clinical and pathological features, making accurate diagnosis challenging. This study aims to better understand the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients diagnosed with GP and PDPC.

A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients diagnosed with GP (n=30) and PDPC (n=25) between 2010 and 2020. Clinical and pathological data were collected and analyzed. Patients with GP had a median age of 63 years, while those with PDPC had a median age of 68 years. Both groups presented with lower urinary tract symptoms, including dysuria and urinary frequency. However, patients with PDPC were more likely to have elevated prostate-specific antigen levels and a higher Gleason score on biopsy.

Treatment outcomes varied between the two groups. Patients with GP typically responded well to medical therapy, including antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In contrast, patients with PDPC often required more aggressive management, such as surgery, radiation therapy, or androgen deprivation therapy.

In conclusion, accurate diagnosis and differentiation of GP and PDPC are crucial for appropriate management and treatment selection. This study highlights the importance of considering clinical and pathological factors when evaluating patients with prostatic lesions.",1

"Expression of P-glycoprotein in adult T-cell leukemia cells. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a membrane protein that plays a crucial role in multidrug resistance (MDR) in various cancers. In this study, we aimed to investigate the expression of P-gp in adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cells. 

Using flow cytometry, we analyzed peripheral blood samples from 20 ATL patients and 10 healthy controls. Our results revealed significantly higher expression of P-gp in ATL cells compared to control samples (p<0.001). Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis of bone marrow biopsies from ATL patients confirmed the overexpression of P-gp in leukemic cells. 

Next, we examined the correlation between P-gp expression and clinical characteristics of ATL patients. Interestingly, a positive correlation was observed between P-gp expression and advanced disease stage (p=0.002). Additionally, patients with higher P-gp expression exhibited poorer response to chemotherapy (p=0.018). 

In conclusion, our findings demonstrate the upregulation of P-gp in ATL cells, suggesting its potential role in conferring MDR and contributing to disease progression. Targeting P-gp may therefore be a promising strategy to overcome treatment resistance and improve outcomes in ATL patients.

"Effect of indomethacin on the pathophysiology of experimental meningitis in rabbits. In this study, we investigate the effect of indomethacin on the pathophysiology of experimental meningitis in rabbits. Meningitis was induced in the animals by intracisternal injection of Streptococcus pneumoniae. The rabbits were then divided into two groups: one group received indomethacin treatment and the other group served as a control. We found that indomethacin significantly reduced the inflammatory response in the meninges, as seen by decreased cerebrospinal fluid levels of inflammatory markers such as interleukin-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Additionally, indomethacin treatment attenuated the blood-brain barrier damage and reduced the number of bacteria in the cerebrospinal fluid. These findings suggest that indomethacin may have potential therapeutic benefits in the management of bacterial meningitis.",1
"Anti-Kveim monoclonal antibody.  New monoclonal antibody reacting to epithelioid cells in sarcoid granulomas. The study aimed to identify risk factors for the transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) among Gambian children aged 6 months to 5 years. Out of the 973 children examined, 33% were found to have evidence of HBV infection, with a third of these children being carriers. The study found a significant association between HBV infection and the presence of tropical ulcer scars, as well as between the presence of e antigenaemia (indicative of active viral replication) and the presence of bedbugs in the child's bed. However, no association was found between HBV infection and traditional scarring, circumcision, or injections. These findings suggest that skin disease and arthropods, specifically bedbugs, may play a crucial role in the transmission of HBV among children in West Africa. Further research on the modes of transmission and preventive measures targeting these risk factors is warranted. In addition, a new monoclonal antibody, specifically targeting epithelioid cells in sarcoid granulomas, has been developed, suggesting potential advancements in the diagnosis and treatment of sarcoidosis.",1

"A blood-liquid interface for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation with excellent antithrombogenicity. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a life-saving technique for patients with severe respiratory or cardiac failure. However, its efficacy is limited by the formation of blood clots within the ECMO circuit. In this study, we developed a novel blood-liquid interface for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation with excellent antithrombogenicity. The interface consisted of a two-layered system, with the upper layer being a plasma-like solution and the lower layer being a silicone oil mixture. We evaluated the antithrombogenicity of this interface using in vitro tests and found a significantly reduced platelet adhesion and activation compared to conventional ECMO circuits. Moreover, the interface maintained a stable oxygen transfer efficiency over a prolonged period. These findings suggest that the blood-liquid interface has the potential to improve the safety and efficacy of ECMO therapy by minimizing thrombotic complications. Further studies are needed to assess its clinical feasibility.",1

"Argon green (514 nm) versus krypton red (647 nm) modified grid laser photocoagulation for diffuse diabetic macular edema. Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a leading cause of vision loss in patients with diabetes. Laser photocoagulation has been widely used as a treatment option for DME, with modified grid laser photocoagulation being one of the recommended techniques. However, the optimal wavelength for this procedure is still debated. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of argon green (514 nm) and krypton red (647 nm) modified grid laser photocoagulation in the treatment of diffuse DME.

A total of 80 eyes from 40 patients with diffuse DME were randomly assigned to receive either argon green or krypton red laser photocoagulation. Visual acuity, central macular thickness, and the presence of macular edema were evaluated at baseline and at regular follow-up visits. The results showed that both laser wavelengths led to a significant improvement in visual acuity and reduction in central macular thickness. However, the argon green laser demonstrated a higher rate of complete resolution of macular edema compared to the krypton red laser.

In conclusion, both argon green and krypton red modified grid laser photocoagulation are effective in improving visual outcomes and reducing macular thickness in patients with diffuse DME. However, the argon green laser appears to have a higher success rate in achieving complete resolution of macular edema. Further studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to confirm these findings and establish the optimal laser wavelength for the treatment of DME.",1

"Effect of felbamate on plasma levels of carbamazepine and its metabolites.  Felbamate (FBM) is a novel antiepileptic drug (AED) currently undergoing clinical evaluation in the United States. This study aimed to investigate the effect of felbamate (FBM) on plasma levels of carbamazepine (CBZ) and its metabolites. A total of 32 patients with epilepsy who were stabilized on CBZ monotherapy were enrolled in this study. The patients were divided into two groups, with Group A receiving FBM in addition to CBZ and Group B continuing on CBZ monotherapy. Plasma levels of CBZ and its active metabolite, carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (CBZ-E), were measured before and after the addition of FBM in Group A and at the same time intervals in Group B. The results showed a significant increase in plasma levels of CBZ and CBZ-E in Group A after the addition of FBM. The increase in CBZ levels was attributed to the inhibitory effect of FBM on the metabolism of CBZ by hepatic enzymes. These findings suggest the need for close monitoring of CBZ levels when FBM is co-administered to ensure optimal therapeutic efficacy and avoid potential drug interactions.",1

"Resting metabolic rate and energy balance in amenorrheic and eumenorrheic runners. Amenorrhea, the absence of menstrual periods, is a common condition among female athletes, particularly in runners. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between resting metabolic rate (RMR) and energy balance in amenorrheic and eumenorrheic runners. RMR was measured using indirect calorimetry in 20 amenorrheic and 20 eumenorrheic runners. Energy balance was assessed by determining energy intake and expenditure through food records and activity diaries. The results showed that amenorrheic runners had significantly lower RMR compared to eumenorrheic runners, even when adjusted for fat-free mass. Additionally, energy intake was significantly lower in amenorrheic runners, while energy expenditure through exercise was similar between the two groups. Consequently, amenorrheic runners had a significantly more negative energy balance compared to their eumenorrheic counterparts. These findings suggest that the lower RMR and reduced energy intake in amenorrheic runners may contribute to the development and maintenance of their menstrual dysfunction. Further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms and develop appropriate interventions to support the metabolic health of amenorrheic athletes.",1
"Periurethral colonic-type polyp simulating urethral caruncle. A 56 year old female presented with recurrent episodes of urinary retention and dysuria. On examination, a fleshy, polypoid mass was observed protruding from the urethral orifice. Initial clinical impression of a urethral caruncle was made. However, histopathological examination revealed a periurethral colonic-type polyp with intestinal metaplasia. This is an extremely rare occurrence, with only a few similar cases reported in the literature. The patient underwent surgical excision of the polyp and subsequent cystoscopy confirmed its complete removal. The differential diagnosis between urethral caruncle and colonic-type polyp can be challenging, highlighting the importance of histopathological confirmation for appropriate management and prevention of recurrence.

"The anatomy and physiology of nerve injury. Nerve injury is a commonly encountered clinical problem with significant implications for patient morbidity and quality of life. Understanding the anatomy and physiology of nerve injury is crucial for accurate diagnosis and effective management. This review aims to provide an overview of the important aspects of nerve anatomy and physiology in relation to injury.

The anatomical structure of a nerve includes the axon, myelin sheath, and connective tissue layers. Nerves can be classified as peripheral or central, based on their location in the body. Peripheral nerves consist of motor, sensory, and autonomic fibers, while central nerves are predominantly composed of myelinated axons. 

Injury to a nerve can occur due to various causes, including trauma, compression, infection, or autoimmune disorders. The extent and severity of nerve injury can vary and may result in functional deficits ranging from mild sensory disturbances to complete loss of motor function. The process of nerve regeneration involves a complex interplay of cellular and molecular events, including Wallerian degeneration, axonal sprouting, and reinnervation.

Understanding the anatomy and physiology of nerve injury is essential for accurate diagnosis, effective management, and implementation of appropriate rehabilitation strategies. Further research is necessary to elucidate the mechanisms underlying nerve regeneration and develop novel therapeutic interventions for patients with nerve injuries.",1

"Cloggology revisited: endoscopic or surgical decompression of malignant biliary obstruction. Malignant biliary obstruction is a common clinical problem that requires interventions like endoscopic or surgical decompression. However, the optimal management strategy remains controversial. This study aimed to compare the outcomes of endoscopic and surgical decompression in patients with malignant biliary obstruction.

A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted, including studies published up to December 2021. The primary outcome measures were technical success, clinical success, complications, and overall survival. Subgroup analyses were performed based on the type of intervention and location of obstruction.

A total of 15 studies involving 1,500 patients were included in the analysis. The pooled results showed similar technical success rates between endoscopic and surgical decompression (90% vs. 87%, respectively). However, endoscopic decompression demonstrated higher clinical success rates compared to surgical decompression (86% vs. 81%). Complication rates were comparable between the two groups. Overall survival did not significantly differ between endoscopic and surgical approaches.

This study investigated the occurrence of milk protein enteropathy following acute infectious gastroenteritis. Experimental trials were conducted on 24 piglets, where 12 were challenged with rotavirus, and 12 served as controls. The rotavirus-infected piglets exhibited a significantly higher incidence of milk protein enteropathy compared to the controls (P less than 0.05). Additionally, clinical observations were conducted on 36 infants with acute gastroenteritis. Of these, 14 infants were found to have milk protein enteropathy. Histological analysis revealed enterocyte damage and lymphocyte infiltration in the small intestines of the affected infants. These findings suggest a potential link between acute infectious gastroenteritis and the development of milk protein enteropathy in infants.",1
"Severe cerebral and systemic necrotizing vasculitis developing during pregnancy in a case of systemic lupus erythematosus. A 32-year-old pregnant woman with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) presented with severe cerebral and systemic necrotizing vasculitis. She had a history of SLE with lupus nephritis and was on immunosuppressive therapy with prednisone and cyclophosphamide. The patient developed progressive neurological symptoms including severe headaches, focal deficits, and seizures. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple infarctions in the cerebral hemispheres and brainstem. A brain biopsy confirmed the presence of necrotizing vasculitis. The patient was also found to have necrotizing vasculitis in other organs, including the heart, lungs, and kidneys. Despite aggressive treatment with high-dose corticosteroids and immunomodulatory agents, the patient's condition continued to deteriorate and she eventually succumbed to multiorgan failure. This case highlights the rare but life-threatening complications of SLE during pregnancy, emphasizing the importance of close monitoring and early intervention in pregnant patients with autoimmune diseases.",1
"Platelet norepinephrine and epinephrine concentration in patients with pheochromocytoma.  Platelet and plasma catecholamine concentrations were determined in 17 patients with surgically proven pheochromocytoma (mean age 42. Platelet norepinephrine and epinephrine concentration were measured in 17 patients diagnosed with pheochromocytoma, a rare adrenal tumor that produces excessive catecholamines. The average age of the patients was 42 years. Blood samples were collected before surgical removal of the tumor. Platelet and plasma catecholamine levels were quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography. Results showed significantly elevated platelet norepinephrine and epinephrine concentrations in all patients compared to normal individuals. This suggests that platelets may serve as a reservoir for catecholamines released by pheochromocytomas. The findings further support the potential use of platelet catecholamine levels as a diagnostic marker for pheochromocytoma, aiding in its early detection and management.",1
"Rigid spine syndrome with respiratory failure. Rigid spine syndrome (RSS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive rigidity and contractures of the spine and limbs, leading to severe disability. We report a case of a 32-year-old patient with RSS who presented with respiratory failure. The patient had a history of gradually worsening muscle stiffness and restricted mobility for the past 10 years. Upon admission, the patient exhibited severe respiratory distress with reduced lung volumes and impaired gas exchange. Pulmonary function tests confirmed restrictive lung disease. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation was initiated, resulting in improvement of respiratory symptoms and gas exchange. However, despite optimal respiratory support, the patient's condition deteriorated rapidly, and invasive mechanical ventilation became necessary. The patient ultimately succumbed to respiratory failure. This case highlights the potential for respiratory complications in patients with RSS and emphasizes the importance of early recognition and appropriate management to optimize outcomes in this challenging population.",1
"Moustache appearance in craniopharyngiomas: unique magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomographic findings of perifocal edema. Craniopharyngiomas are rare benign tumors that originate from remnants of Rathke's pouch and commonly occur in the sellar and suprasellar regions. One distinct and often overlooked characteristic of these tumors is the development of a moustache appearance on imaging studies. This unique radiological finding is characterized by the presence of perifocal edema surrounding the tumor, resembling the shape of a moustache. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) are crucial in diagnosing and characterizing craniopharyngiomas, and they typically reveal a well-defined, cystic-solid mass with calcifications. However, the identification of the moustache appearance on MRI or CT can aid in the accurate diagnosis of craniopharyngiomas and differentiate them from other sellar or suprasellar lesions. Furthermore, the presence of perifocal edema may have implications for the surgical planning and postoperative management of these tumors. This article discusses the distinct MRI and CT findings of perifocal edema in craniopharyngiomas and highlights the importance of recognizing this radiological sign in the diagnosis and management of these rare tumors.",1
"The relationship between hypochondriasis and medical illness.  Forty-one Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III-Revised hypochondriacs were accrued from a primary care practice. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between hypochondriasis and medical illness in a sample of 41 individuals diagnosed with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III-Revised hypochondriasis. Participants were recruited from a primary care practice and underwent thorough medical evaluations to identify any underlying medical conditions. The results showed that the majority of hypochondriacs had no significant medical illness, with only a small subset presenting with minor, non-life-threatening conditions. Interestingly, the severity of hypochondriasis symptoms was not related to the presence or absence of medical illness. Additionally, the study found that hypochondriacs exhibited higher levels of anxiety and depression compared to individuals without hypochondriasis. These findings suggest that hypochondriasis may be a distinct psychological disorder characterized by excessive health-related anxiety and not necessarily driven by the presence of actual medical illness. Further research is needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms and to develop effective interventions for individuals with hypochondriasis.",1
"Cell cycling in bladder carcinoma determined by monoclonal antibody Ki67.  Current methods of predicting prognosis in transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder fail to provide consistently reliable information about future tumour behaviour. The use of monoclonal antibody Ki67 as a marker for cell cycling in bladder carcinoma has shown promise in predicting prognosis. In a study of 100 patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, the expression of Ki67 was assessed using immunohistochemistry. The percentage of Ki67-positive cells was found to be significantly higher in patients with high-grade tumours compared to low-grade tumours. Additionally, a higher Ki67 index was associated with worse overall survival and disease-free survival. Notably, the Ki67 index was found to be a more reliable predictor of prognosis than traditional histopathological features such as tumour stage and grade. These findings suggest that the assessment of Ki67 expression could be a valuable tool in determining the future behaviour of bladder carcinomas and may aid in guiding treatment decisions for patients with this disease.",1
"Anti-Kell in pregnancy.  A review of data on haemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) collected in Newcastle upon Tyne over 25 years revealed 194 pregnancies in which anti-Kell was the only antibody detected. The incidence of anti-Kell in pregnancy was found to be 1 in 184. Of the 194 pregnancies, 17 (8.8%) resulted in the development of HDN, with 13 cases being symptomatic. In these symptomatic cases, the severity ranged from mild to severe, with one case resulting in intrauterine death. The remaining 4 cases of HDN were asymptomatic. The median anti-Kell titer in the symptomatic group was significantly higher than in the asymptomatic group (p < 0.001). In terms of management, all pregnant women with anti-Kell received antenatal prophylaxis with anti-D immunoglobulin, and 11 of the newborns required phototherapy. No cases required exchange transfusion. This study highlights the importance of monitoring anti-Kell levels in pregnant women and provides valuable information for the management of HDN associated with anti-Kell.",1
"Rupture of coronary vasa vasorum as a trigger of acute myocardial infarction. The rupture of coronary vasa vasorum, small blood vessels that supply the walls of larger coronary vessels, has been proposed as a potential trigger for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). This hypothesis was evaluated in a study of 60 patients with AMI. Histopathological analysis of coronary artery specimens revealed that 30 patients (50%) had evidence of vasa vasorum rupture near the site of plaque rupture, while the remaining 30 patients had intact vasa vasorum. Patients with vasa vasorum rupture had a significantly higher prevalence of high-risk plaque features, such as thin-cap fibroatheroma and intraplaque hemorrhage. Furthermore, these patients had a larger infarct size and higher troponin levels compared to those without vasa vasorum rupture. These findings suggest that vasa vasorum rupture may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of AMI. Targeting the vasa vasorum and preventing its rupture could potentially lead to novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment and prevention of AMI.",1
"Hepatic arterial embolization in cases of extensive celiac arterial stenosis. Hepatic arterial embolization is a therapeutic procedure used to treat liver tumors by interrupting the blood supply to the tumor. However, in cases of extensive celiac arterial stenosis, the procedure can be challenging due to limited access to the hepatic artery. We present a case of a 64-year-old male with hepatocellular carcinoma and extensive celiac arterial stenosis. The patient underwent hepatic arterial embolization using a transradial approach, which allowed for successful embolization of the tumor. The transradial approach offered better access to the hepatic artery compared to the traditional transfemoral approach, leading to a safe and effective treatment outcome. This case highlights the importance of considering alternative access routes in cases of extensive celiac arterial stenosis to ensure the successful implementation of hepatic arterial embolization.",1
"Hematoporphyrin photodynamic therapy: is there truly a future in head and neck oncology? Reflections on a 5-year experience. Hematoporphyrin photodynamic therapy (HP-PDT) has been explored as a potential treatment modality for head and neck oncology. This study reflects on a 5-year experience with HP-PDT in this patient population. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 50 patients who underwent HP-PDT for head and neck tumors. The overall response rate was found to be 62%, with a complete response rate of 26%. The majority of patients experienced minimal side effects, with the most common being transient photosensitivity. The long-term outcomes varied, with some patients experiencing recurrence while others remained disease-free. Factors associated with a favorable response to HP-PDT included smaller tumor size, superficial tumor location, and absence of lymph node involvement. Despite some promising results, the future of HP-PDT in head and neck oncology remains uncertain and further research is needed to determine its efficacy and potential role in combination therapy approaches.",1
"Renal abscess in children.  Three cases of renal abscesses in children are described to illustrate the variable presenting features. Renal abscess is a rare but serious condition in children, and its presentation can vary significantly. In this study, we present three cases of renal abscesses in children to highlight the diverse clinical features that can be observed. Each case had distinct presenting symptoms and laboratory findings, making the diagnosis challenging.

The first case involved a 5-year-old male with fever and abdominal pain, while the second case involved a 3-year-old female with dysuria and hematuria. The third case involved a 9-year-old male with flank pain and pyuria. All three cases underwent imaging studies, including ultrasound and computed tomography, which confirmed the presence of renal abscesses.

Prompt diagnosis and treatment initiation are crucial in managing renal abscess in children. Our findings emphasize the importance of considering renal abscess in the differential diagnosis of children presenting with non-specific symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain, dysuria, and hematuria. Awareness of the variable clinical presentation can aid in early detection and appropriate management of renal abscess in the pediatric population.",1
"Esophageal involvement in pemphigus vulgaris: a clinical, histologic, and immunopathologic study. Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is an autoimmune blistering disorder characterized by the presence of intraepithelial blistering and autoantibodies against desmoglein 3 (Dsg3) and desmoglein 1 (Dsg1). Esophageal involvement in PV is relatively common but its clinical, histologic, and immunopathologic characteristics have not been extensively studied. In this study, we analyzed the clinical features, histologic findings, and immunopathologic patterns of 32 patients with esophageal involvement in PV. We found that esophageal involvement in PV is associated with a younger age of onset, higher prevalence of oral involvement, and higher serum anti-Dsg3 antibody levels. Histologically, acantholysis and infiltration of inflammatory cells were observed in the esophageal mucosa. Immunopathologically, direct immunofluorescence revealed IgG and C3 deposition along the intercellular spaces of the esophageal epithelium. These findings provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of esophageal involvement in PV and may contribute to the development of targeted therapies for this condition.",1
"Autoradiographic evaluation of monoclonal antibodies' access to melanoma-associated antigens in melanoma xenografts.  Autoradiography of nude mice bearing human malignant melanoma xenografts was performed to characterize the distribution pattern of radioiodinated anti-melanoma monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) and fragments in macroscopic tumor nodules. Autoradiographic evaluation was conducted to assess the access of monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) to melanoma-associated antigens in melanoma xenografts. Nude mice harboring human malignant melanoma xenografts were utilized for this study. The objective was to determine the distribution pattern of radioiodinated anti-melanoma MoAb and fragments within macroscopic tumor nodules. The results revealed heterogeneous binding of the MoAb and fragments, with variations observed both between and within individual tumor nodules. Some nodules exhibited high uptake, while others displayed limited access. These findings suggest a non-uniform distribution of melanoma-associated antigens within tumor nodules, affecting the accessibility of anti-melanoma MoAb and fragments. Further investigation is warranted to understand the underlying factors contributing to this variability, which could have implications for the effectiveness of targeted therapies in melanoma treatment.",1

The prevalence of AN in this region was found to be 14.6 per 100,000 individuals, with a higher incidence observed in females. The mean age at diagnosis was 17.8 years. The study also revealed a shift towards an older age of onset in recent years. Furthermore, a significant increase in hospital admissions for AN was observed during the study period, indicating a rise in the severity of the illness. These findings highlight the ongoing public health concern associated with AN and emphasize the need for improved prevention and management strategies in this region.",1
"MRI, CT, SPECT, PET: their use in diagnosing dementia. As dementia becomes an increasing global health concern, there is a growing need for accurate and timely diagnostic techniques. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and positron emission tomography (PET) have emerged as valuable imaging modalities in the diagnosis of dementia. This review aims to examine the role of these imaging techniques in differentiating between types of dementia, monitoring disease progression, and evaluating treatment responses. MRI provides detailed structural information of the brain, aiding in the identification of atrophy patterns and vascular abnormalities. CT is useful in ruling out other conditions mimicking dementia and assessing the presence of cerebrovascular disease. SPECT and PET enable the assessment of regional cerebral blood flow, glucose metabolism, and the binding of specific radiotracers, aiding in the differentiation between Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Therefore, combining these imaging techniques with clinical assessment provides a comprehensive approach to diagnosing and managing dementia.",1
"Fetal platelet counts in thrombocytopenic pregnancy Fetal platelet counts were assessed by percutaneous umbilical blood sampling in 64 pregnancies (62 women) with maternal thrombocytopenia. The objective of this study was to evaluate fetal platelet counts in pregnancies complicated by maternal thrombocytopenia. A total of 64 pregnancies from 62 women were included in the analysis. Fetal platelet counts were measured using percutaneous umbilical blood sampling. Maternal thrombocytopenia was associated with a significantly lower mean fetal platelet count compared to pregnancies without maternal thrombocytopenia (p<0.001). The majority of fetuses (81.3%) had platelet counts within the normal range, while 18.7% had decreased platelet counts. Among the cases with decreased platelet counts, the severity of maternal thrombocytopenia was positively correlated with fetal platelet count (p<0.05). Our findings suggest that maternal thrombocytopenia may have an impact on fetal platelet counts, potentially affecting fetal hemostasis. Further studies are warranted to assess the clinical implications of these findings and determine appropriate management strategies for pregnancies complicated by maternal thrombocytopenia.",1
"Lymphomatoid granulomatosis presenting as ulcerodestructive gastrointestinal tract lesions in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection. Lymphomatoid granulomatosis (LG) is an uncommon Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-related lymphoproliferative disorder that predominantly affects the lungs but can also involve other extrapulmonary sites. We report two cases of LG presenting as ulcerodestructive gastrointestinal (GI) tract lesions in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Both patients presented with abdominal pain, weight loss, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Endoscopic examination revealed multiple ulcerated lesions within the stomach and small intestine. Histopathological analysis demonstrated an angiocentric and angiodestructive infiltrate consistent with LG. EBV-encoded RNA in situ hybridization confirmed the presence of EBV in the lesions. Despite counseling regarding chemotherapy, both patients declined further treatment and opted for palliative care. LG should be considered in the differential diagnosis of ulcerodestructive GI lesions in HIV-infected individuals. Early recognition is crucial to guide appropriate management and improve patient outcomes.",1
"The combined use of apraclonidine and pilocarpine during laser iridotomy in a Hispanic population. Primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) is a common cause of vision loss worldwide, especially in certain ethnic populations such as Hispanics. Laser iridotomy is an effective treatment for PACG, but it can be associated with intraoperative complications such as pupillary block and transient postoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) spikes. The use of topical apraclonidine and pilocarpine has been shown to reduce these complications in previous studies. However, there is limited data on the combined use of apraclonidine and pilocarpine specifically in Hispanic populations. In this study, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of combining apraclonidine and pilocarpine during laser iridotomy in a cohort of Hispanic patients with PACG. Our results demonstrate that the combined use of apraclonidine and pilocarpine is well-tolerated and significantly reduces the occurrence of pupillary block and postoperative IOP spikes in this population. Further studies are warranted to validate these findings in larger sample sizes and other ethnic populations.",1
"The acute and insidious onset of pulmonary metastatic transitional cell carcinoma. Pulmonary metastatic transitional cell carcinoma, traditionally thought to have an insidious clinical course, can, on rare occasions, present with an acute onset of symptoms. We present two cases of pulmonary metastatic transitional cell carcinoma, one with an acute presentation and the other with an insidious presentation. The acute presentation was characterized by sudden onset dyspnea, hemoptysis, and chest pain, while the insidious presentation manifested with gradually worsening dyspnea and cough. Both cases were diagnosed with imaging studies and confirmed histologically. Treatment options, including chemotherapy and targeted therapy, were discussed, and both patients showed a partial response to treatment. These cases emphasize the importance of considering pulmonary metastatic transitional cell carcinoma in the differential diagnosis of acute and insidious respiratory symptoms.",1
"A retrospective study of spontaneous remission and long-term outcome in patients with infantile spasms. This retrospective study aimed to investigate the occurrence of spontaneous remission and the long-term outcome in patients with infantile spasms. A total of 85 patients diagnosed with infantile spasms were included in the study, with a median age at onset of 6.5 months. The majority of patients (n=64, 75.3%) received treatment with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) or vigabatrin.

Results showed that spontaneous remission occurred in 28 patients (32.9%) during the initial treatment period, with a median time to remission of 2 months. Among the patients who experienced spontaneous remission, 53.6% remained seizure-free during the follow-up period, while 46.4% experienced recurrence of seizures.

Long-term outcome analysis revealed that 52 patients (61.2%) had a good outcome, defined as seizure freedom and normal development, while 33 patients (38.8%) had a poor outcome, characterized by continued seizure activity and/or developmental delay.

In conclusion, this study highlights the occurrence of spontaneous remission in a significant proportion of patients with infantile spasms. The long-term outcome varied, with approximately two-thirds of patients achieving a good outcome. Further research is needed to identify predictors of spontaneous remission and factors influencing long-term outcome in this population.",1

"Neutrophil dysfunction in glycogen storage disease Ib: association with Crohn's-like colitis. Glycogen storage disease Ib (GSD Ib) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by impaired glucose-6-phosphate translocase activity, leading to defects in neutrophil function. Neutrophil dysfunction in GSD Ib has been associated with an increased risk of developing Crohn's-like colitis, an inflammatory bowel disease. However, the underlying mechanisms linking neutrophil dysfunction and colitis in GSD Ib remain unclear.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of neutrophil dysfunction in the pathogenesis of Crohn's-like colitis in GSD Ib. Neutrophils from GSD Ib patients and healthy controls were evaluated for various functions, including chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Additionally, colonic tissue samples from GSD Ib patients with colitis were examined for inflammatory markers and neutrophil infiltration.

Our results showed that neutrophils from GSD Ib patients exhibited impaired chemotaxis, reduced phagocytic activity, and decreased ROS production compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, colonic tissue specimens from GSD Ib patients with colitis exhibited increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and enhanced neutrophil infiltration. These findings indicate a link between neutrophil dysfunction and the development of Crohn's-like colitis in GSD Ib.

In conclusion, our study suggests that neutrophil dysfunction is associated with the pathogenesis of Crohn's-like colitis in GSD Ib. Further investigation is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and explore potential therapeutic interventions to mitigate colitis development in GSD Ib patients.",1

"Neuroophthalmologic effects of intravenous magnesium sulfate.  To test the hypothesis that visual disturbances are more common during intravenous magnesium sulfate administration than at 1 to 4 days after discontinuation of the drug, 13 women underwent bedside neuroophthalmologic examinations during intravenous magnesium sulfate tocolysis at 2. The aim of this study was to investigate the neuroophthalmologic effects of intravenous magnesium sulfate in 13 women undergoing tocolysis. The hypothesis that visual disturbances would be more prevalent during the administration of magnesium sulfate compared to the period after discontinuation of the drug was tested. Bedside neuroophthalmologic examinations were conducted at 2 time points: during intravenous magnesium sulfate administration and 1 to 4 days after discontinuation. The results showed that visual disturbances were indeed more common during the administration of magnesium sulfate. This suggests that there may be a direct effect of intravenous magnesium sulfate on visual function. Further research is warranted to explore the mechanisms underlying these neuroophthalmologic effects.",1
"Genetic diagnosis of Lynch syndrome II in an extended colorectal cancer-prone family. Lynch syndrome, also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by an increased risk of colorectal and other cancers. Lynch syndrome II is a subtype of Lynch syndrome that is associated with a higher risk of extracolonic cancers. In this study, we present the genetic diagnosis of Lynch syndrome II in an extended colorectal cancer-prone family.

The family consisted of 55 members spanning four generations, with a total of 12 individuals affected by colorectal cancer. Genetic testing was performed using next-generation sequencing to analyze a panel of genes associated with Lynch syndrome. A pathogenic variant in the MLH1 gene was identified in 15 individuals, confirming the diagnosis of Lynch syndrome II in the family.

This study highlights the importance of genetic testing in identifying individuals at risk for Lynch syndrome. Early identification of individuals with pathogenic variants allows for appropriate cancer surveillance and management strategies to be implemented, ultimately reducing morbidity and mortality in affected individuals. Additionally, genetic testing can provide crucial information for family members regarding their own cancer risk and enable them to make informed decisions about genetic counseling and preventative measures.",1
"Anatomic correlations of the long-axis views in biplane transesophageal echocardiography. Biplane transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a valuable tool for cardiac imaging, providing detailed views of the heart from different angles. However, accurate interpretation of TEE requires knowledge of the anatomical correlations of the long-axis views. This study aimed to establish these correlations through a retrospective analysis of TEE images from 50 patients with normal cardiac anatomy. Two-dimensional imaging was used to identify the four long-axis views (vertical, horizontal, apical 4-chamber, and apical 2-chamber) in each patient. The anatomical structures visible in each view were identified and compared with corresponding diagrams and literature references. The findings revealed consistent anatomical correlations for each long-axis view, including the identification of cardiac chambers, valves, and major vessels. These correlations provide a valuable reference for accurate interpretation of TEE images and enhance the diagnostic capabilities of this imaging technique in clinical practice.",1
"Acute gastroenteritis in infants under 6 months old. Acute gastroenteritis is a common illness in infants under 6 months old, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. This review aims to provide an overview of the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of acute gastroenteritis in this vulnerable population. Infants with acute gastroenteritis often present with symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and dehydration. The diagnosis is usually clinical, based on the presence of these symptoms and a thorough physical examination. Laboratory tests, such as stool analysis, may be performed to identify the causative pathogen. Management of acute gastroenteritis in infants focuses on adequate fluid and electrolyte replacement, as well as supportive care. Oral rehydration therapy is the preferred method of fluid replacement, while intravenous fluids are reserved for severe dehydration or failure of oral rehydration. With appropriate management, the prognosis of acute gastroenteritis in infants is generally favorable. Future research should focus on preventive strategies, such as vaccines, to reduce the burden of this disease in this vulnerable population.",1
"Therapeutic options in acute diverticulitis. Acute diverticulitis is a common gastrointestinal condition characterized by inflammation and infection of the diverticula, which are small pouches that develop along the colon wall. The management of acute diverticulitis has evolved over time. Initial treatment typically involves conservative measures such as bowel rest, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and analgesics. In cases of uncomplicated diverticulitis, conservative management is successful in the majority of patients, leading to resolution of symptoms and inflammation. However, in patients with complicated diverticulitis, such as those with abscess formation, perforation, or peritonitis, more aggressive interventions are necessary. These may include percutaneous drainage of abscesses, surgical resection of involved segments of the colon, or colon diversion procedures like colostomy or ileostomy. The optimal approach depends on the severity of the disease, presence of complications, patient comorbidities, and individualized risk-benefit assessment. Close monitoring and follow-up are important to ensure appropriate response to treatment and prevent recurrence of acute diverticulitis.",1
"Celiac disease, brain atrophy, and dementia. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder characterized by an immune reaction to dietary gluten. It is known to cause gastrointestinal symptoms, but its association with neurological manifestations, such as brain atrophy and dementia, is a topic of increasing interest. Several studies have reported a higher prevalence of brain atrophy and cognitive impairment in patients with celiac disease, suggesting a potential link between the two conditions. Mechanisms underlying this association may include direct autoimmune-mediated damage, nutrient deficiencies, or systemic inflammation. Early recognition and management of celiac disease in patients presenting with neurological symptoms may help prevent or mitigate the progression of brain atrophy and cognitive decline. Further research is needed to elucidate the pathophysiology and optimize the management of this intriguing connection between celiac disease, brain atrophy, and dementia.",1
"Progression of peripheral occlusive arterial disease in diabetes mellitus. Peripheral occlusive arterial disease (POAD) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus (DM) and can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. This prospective cohort study aimed to investigate the progression of POAD in patients with DM over a two-year period. 

A total of 200 patients with DM and established POAD were followed up for two years. All participants received standard medical therapy and were regularly monitored for disease progression using ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurements and duplex ultrasonography. 

At the end of the study period, 60% of patients showed progression of POAD, as evidenced by a decrease in ABI or the development of new arterial lesions on duplex ultrasonography. Factors associated with disease progression included older age, longer duration of DM, and higher HbA1c levels. 

Patients who progressed had a significantly higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including myocardial infarction and stroke, compared to those who did not progress (p<0.001). 

In conclusion, this study highlights the high rate of disease progression in patients with DM and POAD over a two-year period.

"The case for porous-coated hip implants.  The femoral side. Porous-coated hip implants have gained popularity in recent years due to their potential to enhance osseointegration and long-term implant stability. This article focuses specifically on the femoral side and presents the case for using porous-coated hip implants in femoral components.

The femoral side of hip implants has traditionally been anchored using cemented or uncemented techniques. However, porous-coated hip implants provide an attractive alternative, as they promote biological fixation by allowing bony ingrowth into the implant surface. This leads to improved implant stability and reduced risk of implant loosening and revision surgery.

Multiple studies have shown favorable outcomes with the use of porous-coated femoral components, including lower rates of aseptic loosening and improved patient satisfaction compared to traditional implants. In addition, modular designs of porous-coated implants allow for customization and potentially better sizing and positioning of the implant components.

While porous-coated hip implants have shown promising results, further research is needed to understand the long-term outcomes and potential complications associated with their use. Nonetheless, the evidence presented in this article supports the use of porous-coated femoral implants as a viable option in hip arthroplasty.",1
"Propranolol and the morning increase in sudden cardiac death: (the beta-blocker heart attack trial experience).  To provide insight into the protective effect of propranolol on mortality after myocardial infarction observed in the beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial, the time of occurrence of sudden cardiac death was examined in this population. The beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial investigated the protective effect of propranolol on mortality following myocardial infarction. To gain further understanding of this effect, the timing of sudden cardiac death was analyzed in the study population. A total of 458 patients who experienced sudden cardiac death were included in the analysis. It was found that the majority of sudden cardiac deaths occurred in the morning between 6:00 am and 10:00 am. This observation suggests that propranolol may have a beneficial effect on preventing sudden cardiac death during this vulnerable time period. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying this protective effect.",1
"Bacterial endocarditis presenting as acute myocardial infarction: a cautionary note for the era of reperfusion. Bacterial endocarditis (BE) is a rare but serious infection of the heart valves, which can lead to complications such as acute myocardial infarction (AMI). With the advent of reperfusion therapies, the presentation of BE as AMI has become even more challenging to diagnose. This case report highlights a cautionary note for physicians in the era of reperfusion.

A 45-year-old male with a history of intravenous drug use presented with chest pain and ST-segment elevation on electrocardiogram. He was initially diagnosed with AMI and treated promptly with primary percutaneous coronary intervention. However, further investigation revealed a new-onset heart murmur, elevated inflammatory markers, and positive blood cultures for Streptococcus viridans. Transesophageal echocardiography confirmed the diagnosis of BE affecting the aortic valve.

This case emphasizes the importance of considering alternative diagnoses in patients presenting with features of AMI, especially in high-risk individuals such as intravenous drug users. Immediate initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy and early involvement of cardiac surgeons are crucial for optimal outcomes in these challenging cases.",1

"Hyperplastic polyps seen at sigmoidoscopy are markers for additional adenomas seen at colonoscopy.  Asymptomatic individuals undergoing screening flexible sigmoidoscopy were prospectively studied. Hyperplastic polyps detected during sigmoidoscopy are often considered benign and of no clinical significance. However, recent studies have highlighted their association with the presence of additional adenomas. In this prospective study, asymptomatic individuals undergoing screening flexible sigmoidoscopy were evaluated to determine the relationship between hyperplastic polyps and the presence of colorectal adenomas detected during subsequent colonoscopy.

A total of 500 participants with a mean age of 55 years were included in the analysis. Sigmoidoscopy revealed the presence of hyperplastic polyps in 25% of individuals, while colonoscopy identified additional adenomas in 40% of these cases. Notably, only 20% of individuals without hyperplastic polyps had adenomas on colonoscopy. The presence of hyperplastic polyps was significantly associated with an increased risk of detecting additional adenomas during colonoscopy (OR=2.5, 95% CI: 1.7-3.8, p<0.001).

These findings suggest that hyperplastic polyps detected during sigmoidoscopy should be considered potential markers for the presence of additional adenomas. Further research is needed to determine the underlying mechanisms and implications for colorectal cancer screening strategies.",1

"Mechanism of intermittent preexcitation in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a cardiac condition characterized by the presence of an additional electrical pathway called an accessory pathway, which causes intermittent preexcitation of the ventricles. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism underlying intermittent preexcitation in WPW syndrome. 

Electrocardiograms (ECGs) of 75 patients with WPW syndrome were analyzed. The presence of intermittent preexcitation was confirmed in 48 patients. During sinus rhythm, intermittent preexcitation was observed as episodes of a short PR interval, slurred upstroke of the QRS complex (delta wave), and widened QRS complex. The accessory pathway demonstrated intermittent conduction, resulting in a variable degree of preexcitation. 

Further electrophysiological studies were performed in a subset of patients to evaluate the electrophysiological properties of the accessory pathway during intermittent preexcitation. These studies revealed varying rates of anterograde conduction through the accessory pathway during episodes of intermittent preexcitation. In some cases, anterograde conduction was completely blocked during intermittent preexcitation, resulting in complete normalization of the QRS complex. 

In conclusion, the mechanism of intermittent preexcitation in WPW syndrome involves varying rates of anterograde conduction through the accessory pathway. The findings suggest that intermittent preexcitation is related to the dynamic behavior of the accessory pathway, emphasizing the importance of careful evaluation and management of patients with WPW syndrome.",1
"Multimodality cisplatin treatment in nonresectable alpha-fetoprotein-positive hepatoma.  Twenty-eight patients with alpha-fetoprotein-positive (AFP+) nonresectable hepatoma have been enrolled in a new multimodality Phase I, II program. The treatment consisted of cisplatin given in combination with other modalities, including surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this multimodality approach in patients with AFP+ nonresectable hepatoma.

The dose was escalated in subsequent cycles based on individual patient tolerance and response. Other treatment modalities, such as radiation therapy and surgery, were tailored to the specific needs of each patient.

Preliminary results showed promising response rates, with a significant reduction in tumor size and stabilization of disease in a substantial number of patients. Adverse events were manageable, with the most common being hematological toxicity and renal impairment. Overall, the multimodality cisplatin treatment showed potential as a therapeutic option for AFP+ nonresectable hepatoma, warranting further investigation in larger clinical trials.",1
"Prevention and changing demographics. Prevention is a key aspect in addressing the changing demographics of disease burden, especially in the context of an aging population. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of implementing a prophylactic regimen for uric acid stones using alternate day doses of alkaline potassium salts. Uric acid stone formation is typically prevented by an increase in urinary pH postprandially, a process that is compromised in patients with such calculi.

The proposed regimen involves the administration of a single dose of alkaline potassium salt every other day, thereby simulating the physiological mechanism seen in individuals with normal postprandial alkaline tide. Patient self-monitoring is an integral part of this regimen, ensuring that urinary pH levels increase to above 6.8 within 1 1/2 to 2 hours after medication intake.

In a cohort of 17 patients, including 7 with recurrent gravel/colic syndrome and 10 with prior stones, this prophylactic approach effectively eliminated calculus formation over an average follow-up period of 2 1/2 years. Notably, this alternate day regimen demonstrated better tolerance and compliance compared to multiple daily doses.

While these preliminary findings are promising, further studies are warranted to establish the efficacy and safety of this regimen before it can be recommended as the standard therapy for uric acid stone prophylaxis. Addressing preventive measures in the face of changing demographics is essential in mitigating disease burden and improving patient outcomes.",1
"Sclerotherapy for esophageal varices.  Endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) frequently is used for patients with esophageal varices, both for controlling acute hemorrhage and for prophylaxis. The effectiveness and safety of endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) in the management of esophageal varices were evaluated. A total of 78 patients with esophageal varices were included in the study. Acute hemorrhage was successfully controlled in 94% of cases, with a rebleeding rate of only 8%. Prophylactic EIS significantly reduced the incidence of variceal hemorrhage, with only 4% of patients experiencing bleeding during the follow-up period. Complications such as esophageal ulceration, strictures, and perforation were rare, occurring in less than 5% of patients. Overall, EIS was found to be a safe and effective treatment option for esophageal varices, both in terms of acute hemorrhage control and prophylaxis.

"Radiology for cochlear implants. Cochlear implants have revolutionized the treatment of severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss. However, the radiological assessment of cochlear implant recipients remains a critical component in determining candidacy, surgical planning, and postoperative evaluation. This review aims to provide an overview of the radiological imaging techniques used in assessing cochlear implant patients. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the two main modalities employed in this population. CT is particularly useful in visualizing the temporal bone anatomy and assessing electrode array position within the cochlea. MRI, on the other hand, provides detailed soft tissue contrast and is valuable in evaluating the neural elements, such as the cochlear nerve, brainstem, and central auditory pathways. Additionally, MRI can aid in the identification of any abnormalities or pathology that may preclude implantation or affect implant outcomes. Understanding the strengths and limitations of these imaging techniques is vital for otolaryngologists, radiologists, and other healthcare professionals involved in the management of cochlear implant patients. Further advancements in imaging technology may continue to enhance our ability to accurately assess cochlear implant recipients and optimize overall patient outcomes.",1

"Immunohistochemical study of erythropoietin in cerebellar hemangioblastomas associated with secondary polycythemia.  Although cerebellar hemangioblastomas are known to be associated with secondary polycythemia, the cellular derivation of erythropoietin (EPO) in hemangioblastomas still remains obscure. In this immunohistochemical study, we investigated the presence and cellular localization of erythropoietin in cerebellar hemangioblastomas associated with secondary polycythemia. The study included five cases of cerebellar hemangioblastomas, all of which exhibited increased erythropoietin expression. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that erythropoietin was primarily localized to the cytoplasm of tumor cells with variable reactivity in blood vessels. Interestingly, erythropoietin expression was more pronounced in areas of increased vascularity within the tumor. These findings suggest that cerebellar hemangioblastomas can produce erythropoietin, which may contribute to the development of secondary polycythemia in these patients. The cellular source of erythropoietin in hemangioblastomas is likely the tumor cells themselves, rather than the surrounding vasculature. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic implications of erythropoietin production in cerebellar hemangioblastomas.",1

"Predicting treatment outcome in nocturnal enuresis. Nocturnal enuresis is a common childhood disorder characterized by involuntary nighttime bedwetting beyond the age of 5 years. Various treatment options have been utilized, including behavioral and pharmacological interventions, with varying degrees of success. However, predicting treatment outcome in individual patients remains a challenge. This review aims to summarize the current literature on factors associated with treatment response in nocturnal enuresis.
Multiple factors have been proposed as potential predictors of treatment outcome. Demographic factors such as age, gender, and family history of enuresis have shown inconsistent associations with treatment response. Comorbid conditions, such as constipation and sleep disorders, have also been explored as potential predictors but have yielded conflicting results. Additionally, the severity and frequency of bedwetting episodes at baseline have been shown to correlate with treatment response in some studies.
Psychosocial factors, such as the child's motivation and parental involvement in treatment, have been identified as important predictors of success. Furthermore, the presence of functional bladder capacity and the ability to awaken in response to a full bladder have been suggested as indicators of treatment efficacy.
In conclusion, while several potential predictors of treatment outcome in nocturnal enuresis have been identified, further research is needed to establish their validity and utility in clinical practice. A better understanding of these predictors may allow for personalized treatment approaches and improve treatment success rates in this common childhood disorder.",1

"Homeobox gene expression plus autocrine growth factor production elicits myeloid leukemia.  In the murine myelomonocytic leukemia WEHI-3B, proviral insertions have induced expression of the Hox-2. This study investigated the role of homeobox gene expression and autocrine growth factor production in the development of myeloid leukemia. The murine myelomonocytic leukemia cell line, WEHI-3B, was used as a model. The results show that proviral insertions induced the expression of the Hox-2 homeobox genes in WEHI-3B cells. Furthermore, these cells also exhibited autocrine growth factor production. Specifically, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was found to be secreted by the WEHI-3B cells and acted as an autocrine growth factor. This autocrine loop of homeobox gene expression and GM-CSF production contributed to the development of myeloid leukemia in this cell line. These findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of myeloid leukemia and may have implications for the development of targeted therapies.",1

"Death and functional outcome after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating form of stroke with high morbidity and mortality rates. However, there is limited data on the long-term functional outcomes and factors associated with death following spontaneous ICH. In this retrospective study, we evaluated 150 patients with spontaneous ICH to assess their functional outcomes and survival rates. We found that the majority of patients (62%) experienced poor functional outcome, defined as a Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 4-6, indicating severe disability or death, at one-year follow-up. Older age, higher baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, larger hematoma volume, presence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and elevated systolic blood pressure at admission were independently associated with poor functional outcome. Additionally, older age, higher baseline NIHSS score, presence of IVH, and larger hematoma volume were identified as independent predictors of increased mortality. These findings highlight the need for early identification and aggressive management of these high-risk factors in order to improve outcomes and reduce mortality rates in patients with spontaneous ICH.",1

"Cholesterol cysts of the temporal bone: diagnosis and treatment.  Cholesterol cyst (or granuloma) of the temporal bone, a recognized clinical entity distinct from cholesteatoma, is more common than previously thought. Cholesterol cysts (or granulomas) of the temporal bone are increasingly being recognized as a distinct clinical entity, separate from cholesteatoma. This study aims to explore the diagnosis and treatment approaches for cholesterol cysts in the temporal bone. A retrospective analysis of patients with cholesterol cysts presenting at our institution was conducted, and demographic data, presenting symptoms, radiographic findings, histopathological characteristics, and treatment outcomes were assessed.

Results showed that cholesterol cysts in the temporal bone are more common than previously thought, with a higher prevalence in males. The most common presenting symptom was hearing loss, followed by tinnitus and vertigo. Radiographically, cholesterol cysts appeared as well-demarcated expansile lesions with low attenuation values on computed tomography scans. Histopathological evaluation exhibited cholesterol crystals surrounded by giant cell reactions.

Surgical management, including cystectomy with simultaneous mastoid obliteration, was found to be the optimal treatment strategy for these cysts, resulting in improved hearing outcomes and lower recurrence rates. In conclusion, cholesterol cysts of the temporal bone should be considered in the differential diagnosis of temporal bone lesions, and surgical intervention is recommended for their successful management.",1
"Acute porphyria presenting with hyperamylasemia. We present a case series of four patients who presented with acute porphyria and hyperamylasemia, highlighting the importance of considering this rare condition in the differential diagnosis of patients with elevated serum amylase levels. All patients had abdominal pain, neurological symptoms, and elevated serum amylase levels, which initially led to a misdiagnosis of acute pancreatitis.

We have studied the effect of extradural analgesia on postoperative venous thrombosis in patients undergoing knee arthroplasty. Postoperative venous thrombosis is a common complication following knee arthroplasty. The use of continuous extradural analgesia has been suggested as a potential method for reducing the incidence of thrombotic events in these patients. In this study, we evaluated the antithrombotic efficacy of continuous extradural analgesia in a cohort of patients undergoing knee replacement surgery. A total of 100 patients were randomized to receive either standard postoperative analgesia or continuous extradural analgesia. The incidence of venous thrombosis was assessed using Doppler ultrasonography at regular intervals postoperatively. Our results showed a significantly lower incidence of venous thrombosis in the extradural analgesia group compared to the control group (p < 0.05). This suggests that continuous extradural analgesia may be an effective strategy for reducing the risk of venous thrombosis following knee replacement surgery. Further studies are warranted to confirm these findings and investigate the underlying mechanisms involved.",1
"Brainstem auditory evoked response and subcortical abnormalities in autism. This study aimed to investigate brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER) and subcortical abnormalities in individuals with autism. A total of 60 participants, including 30 autistic individuals and 30 age-matched controls, were recruited. The BAER was recorded in response to click stimuli, and latencies of waves I, III, and V were measured. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was also performed to examine subcortical abnormalities. The results showed significantly prolonged latencies of waves I and V in the autistic group compared to controls (p<0.05). Furthermore, the MRI analysis revealed that autistic individuals had significantly smaller volumes of the thalamus and hippocampus compared to controls (p<0.05). Additionally, a significant negative correlation was found between thalamic volume and BAER wave V latency in the autistic group (r=-0.42, p<0.05). These findings suggest that individuals with autism exhibit abnormal BAER responses and structural abnormalities in subcortical regions, which may contribute to auditory processing deficits observed in this population.",1

The median time between the initial and repeat hepatic resection was 19.5 months. The overall survival rate at 3 years was 59.7% for patients with primary carcinoma and 45.2% for patients with metastatic carcinoma. The median progression-free survival was 15.4 months for patients with primary carcinoma and 12.6 months for patients with metastatic carcinoma. Repeat hepatic resection is a feasible and effective treatment option for selected patients with primary and metastatic carcinoma of the liver.,1
"Extrahepatic metabolism of morphine occurs in humans.  The pharmacokinetics of morphine was studied in six patients in whom a radiologic localization of an insulinoma was to be performed under general anesthesia. The aim of this study was to investigate the extrahepatic metabolism of morphine in humans. Six patients undergoing radiologic localization of an insulinoma under general anesthesia were administered a single intravenous dose of morphine (0.1 mg/kg). Blood samples were collected at regular intervals up to 6 hours post-administration and analyzed for morphine and its metabolites. The pharmacokinetic parameters of morphine were determined using non-compartmental analysis. The results showed that the metabolism of morphine occurred predominantly in extrahepatic tissues, as evidenced by the rapid decline in plasma morphine levels and the appearance of metabolites in systemic circulation. The mean clearance of morphine was found to be significantly higher than the hepatic blood flow, supporting the notion of extrahepatic metabolism. These findings contribute to our understanding of the pharmacokinetics of morphine and its metabolism in humans, which may have implications for individualized dosing regimens and therapeutic monitoring.",1
"Inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm: an indication for the retroperitoneal approach. Inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm (IAAA) is a rare and potentially life-threatening condition characterized by the presence of inflammation within the wall of the abdominal aorta. The typical clinical presentation includes severe abdominal or back pain, fever, and leukocytosis. The standard treatment approach for IAAA involves open repair via a transperitoneal or retroperitoneal approach. However, retroperitoneal repair may be preferred in certain cases. We present a case of a 68-year-old male with symptomatic IAAA who underwent successful retroperitoneal repair. The patient presented with abdominal pain and an elevated inflammatory marker. Computed tomography angiography revealed an abdominal aortic aneurysm with surrounding inflammatory changes. Due to the presence of severe adhesions from previous surgeries, a retroperitoneal approach was chosen to minimize the risk of injury to the peritoneal structures. This case highlights the importance of considering the retroperitoneal approach in patients with IAAA and significant adhesions, as it can offer a safe and effective alternative to the transperitoneal approach.",1
"Bilateral vocal cord teflon injection. Bilateral vocal cord teflon injection is a procedure commonly used to treat vocal cord paralysis or weakness. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 50 patients who underwent this procedure between 2010 and 2015. The majority of patients were female (78%) and presented with symptoms of hoarseness and voice fatigue. Patient age ranged from 25 to 85 years, with a mean age of 57 years. The procedure resulted in significant improvement in voice quality and stability in 82% of patients. Complications were rare and included temporary hoarseness, aspiration, and infection.

"Prostacyclin-to-thromboxane A2 ratio in arteriogenic impotence. Arteriogenic impotence is a condition characterized by the inability to achieve or maintain an erection due to insufficient blood flow to the penis. This study aimed to investigate the role of the prostacyclin-to-thromboxane A2 (PGI2/TXA2) ratio in arteriogenic impotence. Blood samples were collected from 50 impotent men and 50 age-matched control subjects. The PGI2/TXA2 ratio was significantly lower in impotent men compared to controls, suggesting decreased prostacyclin and increased thromboxane A2 activity. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation was found between the PGI2/TXA2 ratio and penile blood flow. These findings suggest that alterations in the PGI2/TXA2 ratio may contribute to the pathogenesis of arteriogenic impotence. Further research is needed to explore the potential therapeutic implications of targeting the PGI2/TXA2 pathway in the treatment of this condition.",1
"Cerebral venography with MR.  The authors describe a two-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance (MR) angiography technique to create projection venograms of the head. The authors present a novel application of two-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance (MR) angiography technique for the creation of projection venograms of the head. Cerebral venography is an important diagnostic tool for evaluating venous abnormalities, such as venous thrombosis or arteriovenous malformations. Traditional methods of cerebral venography involve invasive procedures with contrast agents, which may pose risks to patients. The proposed technique utilizes MR angiography with projection images to visualize the cerebral veins non-invasively. The authors describe the imaging technique and provide examples of the utility of this method in identifying cerebral venous abnormalities. Preliminary results indicate that this technique offers a promising alternative to traditional cerebral venography, with comparable diagnostic accuracy and improved patient safety. Further studies are warranted to validate this novel approach and explore its potential applications in clinical practice.",1
"Hemodynamic effects of partial correction of chronic anemia by recombinant human erythropoietin in patients on dialysis.  Eighteen patients on chronic hemodialysis with renal anemia were treated with recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO). This study aimed to evaluate the hemodynamic effects of partial correction of chronic anemia using recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) in patients on dialysis. Eighteen patients with renal anemia undergoing chronic hemodialysis were included in the study. Following treatment with r-HuEPO, there was a significant increase in hemoglobin levels, with a mean increase of 2.5 g/dL. Concurrently, there was a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure. The reduction in blood pressure was proportional to the increase in hemoglobin. These findings suggest that partial correction of chronic anemia with r-HuEPO in patients on dialysis has favorable hemodynamic effects, potentially offering therapeutic benefits in the management of hypertension in this population.",1

"Mastalgia refractory to drug treatment. Mastalgia, or breast pain, is a common complaint among women, and it can significantly impact quality of life. While most cases of mastalgia can be managed effectively with conservative measures and pharmacological treatments, there are some cases that are refractory to drug treatment. This case report presents the clinical characteristics and management of a patient with mastalgia that did not respond to conventional drug therapy.

The patient, a 42-year-old woman, presented with bilateral mastalgia that persisted despite treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and topical lidocaine gel. Physical examination and imaging studies, including mammography and breast ultrasonography, did not reveal any significant abnormalities. The patient's medical history was unremarkable, and she had no family history of breast cancer or other breast conditions.

Given the persistence of symptoms and the lack of response to conventional treatment, alternative interventions were explored. These included acupuncture, cognitive behavioral therapy, and dietary modifications. While these interventions provided some relief, the patient still experienced intermittent episodes of significant mastalgia.

This case highlights the challenges in managing refractory mastalgia and suggests the need for further research to identify optimal treatment strategies for this subset of patients.",1

"Secondary femoral-distal bypass.  Thirty-nine secondary femoral-distal (femorotibial and femoroperoneal) bypasses were reviewed and compared to 89 primary femoral-distal bypasses (done during the same time period) to investigate the efficacy of secondary femoral-distal bypass. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of secondary femoral-distal bypass compared to primary femoral-distal bypass. A total of 39 secondary femoral-distal bypass cases were reviewed and compared to 89 primary femoral-distal bypass cases, all performed during the same time period. The primary outcome measures included graft patency, limb salvage, and overall patient survival. The secondary femoral-distal bypasses were found to have similar rates of graft patency compared to the primary procedures. However, limb salvage rates were lower in the secondary bypass group, with a higher incidence of limb loss observed. Patient survival was comparable between the two groups. These findings suggest that while secondary femoral-distal bypass can achieve satisfactory graft patency, it may be associated with a higher risk of limb loss compared to primary bypass procedures. Further research is needed to identify factors contributing to this difference in limb salvage outcomes.",1

This case emphasizes the importance of early recognition, accurate diagnosis, and timely surgical intervention in treating bowel perforation associated with EDS IV.",1
"Emerging techniques in the diagnosis of sinusitis. Sinusitis is a common condition with a wide range of etiologies and clinical presentations. Traditional diagnostic methods such as history taking, physical examination, and imaging are often inconclusive and may not accurately determine the underlying cause of sinusitis. In recent years, emerging techniques have provided new insights into the diagnosis of sinusitis.

One such technique is nasal endoscopy, which allows direct visualization of the nasal cavity and sinuses. This can aid in the identification of anatomical abnormalities, mucosal changes, and presence of polyps or pus. Additionally, nasal endoscopy can facilitate targeted sampling of nasal secretions or tissue for microbiological analysis.

Another emerging technique is molecular diagnostics, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. PCR assays can detect and identify specific pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, with high sensitivity and specificity. This can help differentiate between infectious and non-infectious causes of sinusitis, guide appropriate antibiotic therapy, and potentially reduce unnecessary antibiotic use.

Furthermore, imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have undergone advancements, allowing for better visualization of the sinuses and surrounding structures. These imaging modalities can aid in the detection of sinus inflammation, mucosal thickening, and complications of sinusitis, such as abscess formation or involvement of adjacent structures.

In conclusion, emerging techniques in the diagnosis of sinusitis, including nasal endoscopy, molecular diagnostics, and advanced imaging, hold promise for improving the accuracy and specificity of diagnosing sinusitis. These advancements may lead to more targeted and effective management strategies for patients with sinusitis.",1
"Variceal rebleeding after portosystemic shunting. This retrospective study aimed to determine the incidence and risk factors associated with variceal rebleeding after portosystemic shunting for the management of portal hypertension. The medical records of 328 patients who underwent portosystemic shunting were reviewed, and the occurrence of variceal rebleeding was analyzed. The overall incidence of variceal rebleeding after portosystemic shunting was found to be 15% (49/328). The mean time to rebleeding was 18 months after the shunting procedure. Multivariate analysis identified several risk factors for variceal rebleeding, including advanced liver disease (Child-Pugh class B/C), previous variceal bleeding, a small shunt diameter, incomplete shunt occlusion, and thrombosis of the shunt. The presence of two or more of these risk factors significantly increased the risk of variceal rebleeding. These findings highlight the importance of careful patient selection and shunt maintenance in order to minimize the occurrence of variceal rebleeding after portosystemic shunting. Further studies are needed to identify additional risk factors and optimize treatment strategies for this complication.",1

"Extrageniculate vision in hemianopic humans: saccade inhibition by signals in the blind field. Hemianopia, or visual field loss in half of the visual field, is a common consequence of cerebral lesions. However, recent studies have shown that some hemianopic individuals possess the ability to process visual information in their blind visual field, a phenomenon known as extrageniculate vision. In this study, we investigate the role of saccade inhibition by signals in the blind field in three hemianopic individuals. We found that these individuals demonstrated a significant reduction in saccade frequency towards stimuli presented in their blind visual field compared to stimuli in their intact visual field. Our results suggest that extrageniculate vision may be a compensatory mechanism for preserving visual function in hemianopic individuals.",1
"The relation of serum cholesterol to risk of coronary heart disease: implications for the elderly. This study examines the relation between serum cholesterol levels and the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in the elderly population. A cohort of individuals aged 65 and older was followed for a period of 10 years, during which incident cases of CHD were recorded. Baseline serum cholesterol levels were measured and participants were categorized into four groups based on their cholesterol levels. The results showed a significant positive association between higher serum cholesterol levels and an increased risk of CHD. Furthermore, this association was found to be particularly strong in individuals over the age of 75. These findings have important implications for the elderly population, suggesting that maintaining low serum cholesterol levels may be crucial for preventing CHD in this age group. Further research is needed to explore the mechanisms underlying this association and to determine optimal cholesterol management strategies for the elderly.",1
"Detection of loss of heterozygosity in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor specimens by the polymerase chain reaction. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is a common genetic alteration in various types of tumors and is associated with the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. In this study, we evaluated the utility of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detecting LOH in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor specimens. A total of 50 FFPE tumor samples were analyzed for LOH at three microsatellite markers linked to well-known tumor suppressor genes. PCR analysis revealed LOH in 70% of the samples, indicating the presence of allelic imbalances. These findings were further confirmed by sequencing analysis. Importantly, LOH was detected in samples with different tumor types, suggesting that this approach is applicable across a range of malignancies. Our results demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of PCR-based LOH analysis in FFPE tumor specimens, providing a valuable tool for molecular characterization and prognostic assessment of various cancers.",1
"Association of Escherichia coli HEp-2 adherence patterns with type and duration of diarrhoea. We conducted a study to investigate the association between Escherichia coli (E. coli) HEp-2 adherence patterns and the type and duration of diarrhoea in patients. Stool samples were collected from patients presenting with acute or persistent diarrhoea. Adherence patterns of E. coli isolates were determined using the HEp-2 cell adherence assay. The results showed that diffuse adherence (DA) was the most common pattern observed in both acute and persistent diarrhoea cases, followed by localized adherence (LA) and aggregative adherence (AA). Interestingly, DA was significantly associated with acute diarrhoea, while LA was more prevalent in persistent diarrhoea cases. Furthermore, we found that longer duration of diarrhoea was associated with increased prevalence of both DA and AA patterns. These findings suggest that E. coli HEp-2 adherence patterns may serve as a potential indicator for the type and duration of diarrhoea, aiding in the diagnosis and treatment of E. coli-associated diarrhoeal illnesses.",1
"Vertical partial laryngectomy on demand. Vertical partial laryngectomy (VPL) is a surgical procedure commonly used for the treatment of laryngeal cancer. This study assessed the feasibility and outcomes of performing VPL on demand, as compared to scheduled surgeries. A total of 45 patients with laryngeal cancer were enrolled, with 23 undergoing VPL on demand and 22 receiving scheduled VPL. The two groups were comparable in terms of age, tumor characteristics, and preoperative vocal function. The on-demand group had significantly shorter waiting times for surgery.

"Effects of medical and surgical treatment on cerebral perfusion and cognition in patients with chronic cerebral ischemia. Chronic cerebral ischemia is a condition characterized by inadequate blood supply to the brain, leading to cognitive impairment and decreased cerebral perfusion. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of medical and surgical treatment on cerebral perfusion and cognition in patients with this condition. A total of 57 patients were included in the study and divided into two groups: medical treatment (n=33) and surgical treatment (n=24). Cerebral perfusion was assessed using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) before and after treatment. Cognitive function was evaluated using neuropsychological tests. 

Results showed that both medical and surgical treatment significantly improved cerebral perfusion in patients with chronic cerebral ischemia. However, surgical treatment resulted in a more pronounced improvement compared to medical treatment (p<0.05). Additionally, the surgical treatment group showed greater improvements in cognitive function compared to the medical treatment group (p<0.05). These findings suggest that surgical intervention may be more effective in restoring cerebral perfusion and improving cognition in patients with chronic cerebral ischemia.

"Lipolytic factors associated with murine and human cancer cachexia. Cachexia is a common and debilitating syndrome often seen in cancer patients, characterized by weight loss, muscle wasting, and metabolic abnormalities. Lipolytic factors, responsible for the breakdown of fat stores, have been implicated in the development of cancer cachexia. In this study, we investigated the association between lipolytic factors and cancer cachexia in both murine and human models.

In a murine model of cancer cachexia, we analyzed the expression of lipolytic factors in adipose tissue during tumor progression. We found that levels of lipolytic factors, such as adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), were significantly increased in cachectic mice compared to controls. Furthermore, inhibition of ATGL and HSL attenuated weight loss and muscle wasting in cachectic mice.

In human cancer patients, we measured circulating levels of lipolytic factors and correlated them with clinical parameters of cachexia. We observed elevated levels of ATGL and HSL in cachectic patients compared to non-cachectic individuals. Moreover, higher levels of these lipolytic factors were associated with greater weight loss and muscle wasting in cancer patients.

Our findings suggest that lipolytic factors play a critical role in the development of cancer cachexia. Targeting these factors may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for managing cachexia and improving patient outcomes. Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and develop targeted interventions for this devastating syndrome.",1

Analysis of risk factors included age, sex, attendance at day-care center, presence of siblings, breastfeeding history, and exposure to passive smoking.

The overall incidence of otitis media in the study population was 45%, with a higher prevalence in children aged less than 2 years (60%). Attendance at day-care centers was found to be a significant risk factor, with children spending more hours in day-care exhibiting a higher incidence of otitis media. Presence of siblings and exposure to passive smoking also significantly increased the risk.

These findings suggest that day-care attendance, presence of siblings, and exposure to passive smoking are important risk factors for otitis media in young children. Early identification and intervention strategies targeting these factors may help reduce the burden of otitis media in day-care settings.",1
"Micromotion of cemented and uncemented femoral components. Micromotion of femoral components in total hip arthroplasty is a common concern that may lead to implant loosening and failure. This study aimed to compare the micromotion of cemented and uncemented femoral components in a cohort of patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty. A total of 50 patients were included in the study, with 25 receiving a cemented femoral component and 25 receiving an uncemented femoral component. Micromotion of the femoral component was measured using radiostereometric analysis at various time points postoperatively. The results showed significantly higher micromotion in the uncemented group compared to the cemented group at all time points. This finding suggests that cemented femoral components provide more stability and reduce micromotion in total hip arthroplasty. Further research is needed to investigate the long-term clinical implications of these findings.",1
"Posterior transfer of the adductors in children who have cerebral palsy.  A long-term study. Cerebral palsy (CP) is a neurological disorder characterized by abnormal muscle tone, posture, and movement. The adductor muscles of the hip are commonly affected, leading to scissoring gait and difficulty with ambulation. Surgical intervention, such as posterior transfer of the adductors, may be considered to improve functional outcomes in these patients. This long-term study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of posterior adductor transfer in children with CP. A total of 50 patients who underwent the procedure were followed for an average of 10 years. The study assessed changes in gait, muscle tone, and range of motion postoperatively. Overall, the results demonstrated significant improvements in gait pattern, reduction in muscle tone, and increased range of motion in the hip joint. These findings suggest that posterior adductor transfer is an effective surgical intervention for children with CP, providing long-term functional benefits. Further research is needed to explore additional factors influencing outcomes and refine surgical techniques.",1
"Amebic meningoencephalitis in a patient with AIDS caused by a newly recognized opportunistic pathogen.  Leptomyxid ameba. We present a case report of amebic meningoencephalitis in a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) caused by a newly recognized opportunistic pathogen, Leptomyxid ameba. The patient, a 45-year-old male with a history of intravenous drug use and unprotected sexual activity, presented with symptoms of headache, confusion, and seizures. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed an elevated white blood cell count and protein level, and magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple enhancing lesions in the brain. A cerebrospinal fluid culture grew an organism identified as Leptomyxid ameba, a rare and poorly understood pathogen. The patient was started on antimicrobial therapy including amphotericin B, but unfortunately, his condition rapidly deteriorated and he succumbed to the disease within a week of presentation. This case highlights the importance of considering opportunistic infections in patients with AIDS who present with neurological symptoms, especially when conventional pathogens are not identified. Further research is needed to better understand the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and treatment options for Leptomyxid ameba infections.",1

Patients with multiple noncontiguous fractures had a higher injury severity score and longer hospital stays compared to those with a single fracture. This study highlights the importance of recognizing and appropriately managing multiple noncontiguous spine fractures to optimize patient outcomes.",1
"Sequential esophageal motility studies after endoscopic injection sclerotherapy: a prospective investigation.  To assess prospectively the effects of endoscopic intravariceal sclerosis (EIS) on esophageal function, we performed esophageal manometry on 13 cirrhotic patients before EIS, 24 h after the second session and 4 wk after the fourth session. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of endoscopic intravariceal sclerosis (EIS) on esophageal motility through sequential esophageal motility studies. Thirteen cirrhotic patients were included in this prospective investigation. Esophageal manometry was performed prior to EIS, 24 hours after the second session, and 4 weeks after the fourth session. The study revealed that EIS had a significant effect on esophageal function. There was a noticeable decrease in esophageal peristalsis and lower esophageal sphincter tone after EIS administration. These changes were observed immediately after the second session and persisted even after 4 weeks. These findings suggest that EIS can impact esophageal motility, potentially leading to functional impairments. Further research should be conducted to evaluate the long-term effects of EIS on esophageal function and to identify appropriate management strategies for such complications.",1

"Massive allografts in salvage revisions of failed total knee arthroplasties.  Ten patients with failed total knee arthroplasties and severe bone loss were treated with massive whole distal femur and proximal tibial allografts in combination with prosthetic implants. Massive bone loss is a challenging issue in revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and can compromise the stability and longevity of prosthetic implants. To address this problem, we present a case series of ten patients who underwent salvage revisions of failed TKA using massive allografts combined with prosthetic implants. The allografts consisted of whole distal femur and proximal tibia, addressing both bone loss and structural defects. All patients were followed up for at least two years, and clinical, radiographic, and functional outcomes were evaluated. Our results demonstrate that the use of massive allografts in combination with prosthetic implants can provide satisfactory stability and functional outcomes in patients with severe bone loss. Further studies are warranted to establish the long-term efficacy and safety of this procedure.",1
"Controlled trial of antimycobacterial therapy in Crohn's disease.  Clofazimine versus placebo. Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease characterized by transmural inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Recent studies have suggested a potential association between Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) and Crohn's disease. This controlled trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy of antimycobacterial therapy in the management of Crohn's disease.

A total of 80 patients with active Crohn's disease were randomly assigned to receive either clofazimine, an antimycobacterial agent, or placebo for a duration of 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the clinical response, defined as a reduction in Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score of ≥70 points or remission, at week 12.

The results showed that patients receiving clofazimine had a significantly higher clinical response rate compared to those receiving placebo (62.5% vs. 32.5%, p=0.029). Moreover, the proportion of patients achieving remission was also higher in the clofazimine group (37.5% vs. 17.5%, p=0.046).

In conclusion, this controlled trial provides evidence for the efficacy of antimycobacterial therapy, specifically clofazimine, in the management of active Crohn's disease. Further research is needed to elucidate the exact mechanism of action and long-term effects of antimycobacterial therapy in this patient population.",1
"Blue breath holding is benign. Blue breath holding is a benign phenomenon commonly observed in young children. It is characterized by a sudden, involuntary breath holding episode that is often preceded by a minor emotional or physical stimuli, such as frustration, pain, or startle. During these episodes, the child's face turns blue or pale, they lose consciousness, and may experience muscle stiffness or jerking. However, the child spontaneously recovers within a minute without any long-term sequelae. The underlying mechanism of blue breath holding involves an involuntary reflexive apnea followed by a Valsalva maneuver. Although frightening for parents and caregivers, blue breath holding is generally harmless and does not require specific intervention or treatment. Education and reassurance are essential in managing and alleviating parental anxiety associated with this phenomenon.",1
"Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction presenting as ascites: the importance of clinically assessing central venous pressure. Diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle is a common finding in patients with heart failure. However, the presentation of ascites as the initial manifestation of diastolic dysfunction is not well documented in the literature. We present a case of a 62-year-old female who presented with progressive abdominal distension and dyspnea on exertion. Physical examination revealed ascites, but no other signs of heart failure. Further evaluation, including echocardiography, demonstrated preserved systolic function but severe diastolic dysfunction. The measurement of central venous pressure, which was markedly elevated, was crucial in making the diagnosis. This case highlights the importance of considering diastolic dysfunction as a potential cause of ascites and the utility of clinically assessing central venous pressure in these patients.",1
"Excitatory amino acids in the developing brain: ontogeny, plasticity, and excitotoxicity. Excitatory amino acids play a crucial role in the developing brain, influencing neurodevelopment, plasticity, and excitotoxicity. This article provides an overview of the ontogeny of excitatory amino acids, focusing on the changes that occur during different stages of brain development. Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, and its receptors undergo significant developmental changes, leading to dynamic alterations in synaptic plasticity and neuronal excitability. However, excessive activation of excitatory amino acid receptors can lead to excitotoxicity, a pathological process associated with various neurological disorders.

"Perianal appearances associated with constipation.  The perianal appearances were studied prospectively of 136 constipated children (mean age 3. The perianal appearances of 136 constipated children (mean age 3.8 years) were studied prospectively to investigate their association with constipation. The majority of children (85%) presented with perianal findings, such as perianal erythema (67%), maceration (41%), and fissures (24%). These findings were significantly more prevalent in children with chronic constipation compared to those with intermittent constipation. Furthermore, the severity of perianal erythema and maceration was found to be positively correlated with the duration and severity of constipation. There was also a positive association between the presence of fissures and the frequency of constipation episodes per week. These findings suggest that perianal appearances, specifically perianal erythema, maceration, and fissures, are common in constipated children and may serve as indicators of the severity and chronicity of constipation. Therefore, the identification and management of these perianal findings should be an integral part of the evaluation and treatment of children with constipation.",1

"Intravenous but not intracolonic epidermal growth factor maintains colonocyte proliferation in defunctioned rat colorectum. To investigate the effect of intravenous (IV) and intracolonic (IC) epidermal growth factor (EGF) on colonocyte proliferation in the defunctioned rat colorectum, a study was conducted on 20 male rats. The rats were divided into four groups: control, IV EGF, IC EGF, and IC phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The rats in the IV EGF and IC EGF groups received 50 μg/kg of EGF while the control and IC PBS groups received equivalent volumes of PBS. After 14 days, colon tissue biopsy specimens were obtained and analyzed for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Ki-67 expression. The results showed that IV EGF significantly increased PCNA and Ki-67 expression, indicating increased colonocyte proliferation, compared to the control and IC PBS groups. However, IC EGF did not show a significant effect on colonocyte proliferation. Therefore, it was concluded that IV, but not IC, administration of EGF maintains colonocyte proliferation in the defunctioned rat colorectum.",1
"Endoscopic ventricular fenestration using a ""saline torch"".  The fiberoptic endoscope has never gained popularity among neurosurgeons although it is ideally suited for navigating within the cerebral ventricles. Endoscopic ventricular fenestration is a procedure that is commonly performed in cases of hydrocephalus. However, the use of a fiberoptic endoscope for this purpose has met with limited acceptance among neurosurgeons. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of endoscopic ventricular fenestration using a novel technique called the ""saline torch"". 

A total of 30 patients with hydrocephalus were included in this study. The procedure was performed under general anesthesia using a fiberoptic endoscope equipped with the saline torch. The saline torch consisted of a saline-filled catheter with an attached light source. The endoscope was inserted into the cerebral ventricles through a burr hole, and the saline torch was used to create a fenestration in the ventricular wall.

The results showed that endoscopic ventricular fenestration using the saline torch was successful in all cases. The procedure was associated with minimal intraoperative bleeding and no major complications were reported. Postoperative imaging confirmed the patency of the fenestration and demonstrated a significant reduction in ventricular size.

In conclusion, endoscopic ventricular fenestration using the saline torch is a safe and effective technique for the treatment of hydrocephalus. Further studies are warranted to evaluate its long-term outcomes and compare it to conventional surgical methods.",1
"Wound infection following early repeat sternotomy for postoperative bleeding. This abstract presents a case of wound infection following early repeat sternotomy for postoperative bleeding. The patient underwent cardiac surgery and developed postoperative bleeding requiring a repeat sternotomy within 48 hours. The patient initially had an uneventful recovery but subsequently developed a wound infection at the incision site, manifesting as erythema, swelling, and purulent discharge. The wound cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus, indicating a healthcare-associated infection. Treatment involved surgical debridement, empiric antibiotic therapy, and wound care. Risk factors for infection in this case included the repeat sternotomy, prolonged operative time, the close proximity of the initial incision to the sternum, potential contamination during surgery, and the presence of a foreign body (surgical hardware).

"Spontaneous perinephric hemorrhage: imaging and management. Spontaneous perinephric hemorrhage is a rare condition that can have potentially life-threatening consequences. Prompt diagnosis and effective management are crucial in order to prevent further complications and improve patient outcomes. This abstract aims to review the imaging modalities and management strategies for spontaneous perinephric hemorrhage.

Various imaging techniques such as ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) play a pivotal role in the diagnosis of spontaneous perinephric hemorrhage. Ultrasound is often the initial imaging modality of choice due to its accessibility and ability to detect free fluid in the perinephric space. CT scan provides more detailed information about the extent and location of the hemorrhage, aiding in surgical planning. MRI, although less commonly used, can provide valuable information regarding the presence of active bleeding and help identify underlying causes.

Management options for spontaneous perinephric hemorrhage range from conservative approaches such as observation and bed rest to more invasive interventions such as embolization or surgical exploration. Factors such as the severity of bleeding, stability of the patient, and underlying etiology should be considered when determining the optimal management strategy.

In conclusion, spontaneous perinephric hemorrhage requires prompt and accurate diagnosis using imaging modalities. Appropriate management strategies should be tailored to individual patients based on the extent of the hemorrhage and underlying etiology.",1

"Disruption of the human SCL locus by ""illegitimate"" V-(D)-J recombinase activity. The SCL locus plays a critical role in the development and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. In this study, we investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the disruption of the SCL locus in patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). We demonstrate that this disruption is due to ""illegitimate"" V-(D)-J recombinase activity, leading to the aberrant recombination of the T-cell receptor (TCR) genes with the SCL locus. Specifically, we identify a novel rearrangement involving the TCR alpha/delta locus and the SCL locus in a subset of T-ALL patients. This rearrangement results in the deletion of important regulatory elements within the SCL locus, leading to the dysregulation of SCL expression and the development of T-ALL. Our findings provide insights into the molecular pathogenesis of T-ALL and highlight the potential role of V-(D)-J recombinase activity in driving oncogenic rearrangements.",1

Overall, embolization with particles was found to be a safe and effective treatment modality for thoracic intramedullary AVMs, offering long-term angiographic obliteration and clinical improvement in the majority of cases. Further studies are warranted to validate these findings and optimize treatment strategies for intramedullary AVMs.",1
"Mucogenic secondary open-angle glaucoma in diffuse epithelial ingrowth treated by block-excision. Diffuse epithelial ingrowth leading to secondary open-angle glaucoma is a rare complication following ocular surgery. We present a case report of a 45-year-old woman who developed mucogenic secondary open-angle glaucoma secondary to diffuse epithelial ingrowth after cataract surgery. The patient presented with elevated intraocular pressure, optic nerve cupping, and visual field defects. Treatment with topical glaucoma medications failed to adequately control her intraocular pressure. Block-excision of the fibrovascular mass was performed, resulting in a significant reduction in intraocular pressure and improvement in optic nerve appearance and visual field defects. This case highlights the importance of considering diffuse epithelial ingrowth as a potential cause of secondary open-angle glaucoma, and the efficacy of block-excision in its management.",1
"Persistent uptake of indium-111-antimyosin monoclonal antibody in patients with myocardial infarction. In this study, we investigated the persistence of indium-111-antimyosin monoclonal antibody (IMMA) uptake in patients with myocardial infarction (MI). Twenty-five patients who had recently experienced MI were enrolled in the study. Each patient underwent single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging using IMMA at multiple time points: 24 hours, 5 days, 1 month, and 3 months after the initial MI. The SPECT images were analyzed for IMMA uptake in various myocardial regions. Our results demonstrated that all patients showed persistent IMMA uptake at all time points during the study period. The uptake was most pronounced at 24 hours, gradually decreased over time, but remained detectable even at 3 months. These findings suggest that IMMA uptake can persist in patients with MI and may serve as a valuable tool for the early detection and assessment of myocardial damage in this population.",1
"Functional outcomes following selective posterior rhizotomy in children with cerebral palsy. Selective posterior rhizotomy (SPR) is a surgical procedure commonly performed in children with cerebral palsy (CP) to alleviate spasticity. This study aimed to evaluate functional outcomes following SPR in a cohort of children with CP. Fifty-seven children with CP who underwent SPR were included in the study. Functional assessment was carried out using the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) and the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI). The results showed significant improvements in GMFCS levels and PEDI scores postoperatively. The majority of children showed a decrease in spasticity and improved gait patterns. However, a small proportion of children experienced complications, including postoperative pain and weakness. Additionally, older age at the time of surgery was associated with poorer functional outcomes. These findings suggest that SPR can be an effective treatment option for children with CP, but careful patient selection and postoperative management are necessary for optimizing functional outcomes.",1

"Postinduction repression of the beta-interferon gene is mediated through two positive regulatory domains. The beta-interferon gene (IFNB1) is a crucial component of the immune response against viral infections. Its expression is tightly regulated, and postinduction repression plays a critical role in preventing prolonged activation of the immune system. However, the mechanism underlying the repression of IFNB1 gene after its initial induction remains poorly understood. In this study, we identify two positive regulatory domains (PRDs) located within the IFNB1 gene that contribute to its postinduction repression. Using various molecular techniques, we demonstrate that the PRDs act as binding sites for transcriptional repressors, which inhibit IFNB1 gene expression. Furthermore, we show that mutation or deletion of these PRDs leads to prolonged expression of IFNB1 and dysregulated immune response. These findings provide valuable insights into the regulatory mechanisms governing the postinduction repression of the IFNB1 gene and may have implications for the development of therapeutic interventions targeting viral infections and autoimmune diseases.",1

The technique involves utilizing the ileocolonic segment to construct the reservoir, which is then anastomosed to the urethra or an artificial outlet created using the ileocecal valve or appendix. The reservoir can be lined using various techniques, including ureteroileal anastomosis or direct ureteral implantation. Long-term follow-up studies have shown satisfactory outcomes with low complication rates, making continent ileocolonic urinary reservoirs a promising solution for patients undergoing pelvic exenteration.",1
"Exercise capability in heart failure: is cardiac output important after all? The exercise capability of 39 patients with severe chronic heart failure was assessed in several ways and compared with measurements of cardiac output.  The relation between cardiac index and exercise tolerance measured on a treadmill was poor (r = 0. This study aimed to determine the significance of cardiac output in the exercise capability of patients with severe chronic heart failure. The exercise capacity of 39 patients was evaluated through various assessments, and these results were then compared with measurements of cardiac output. Surprisingly, the correlation between cardiac index and exercise tolerance, measured on a treadmill, was found to be poor (r = 0.21). These findings suggest that other factors may play a more crucial role in determining exercise capability in heart failure patients. Further research is needed to explore these alternative factors and improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying exercise intolerance in this population.",1
"Routes and incidence of communication of lumbar discs with surrounding neural structures. The aim of this study was to investigate the routes and incidence of communication between lumbar discs and surrounding neural structures. A total of 50 patients with lumbar disc herniation were included in the study. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to determine the presence and location of communication between the discs and neural structures. The results showed that communication between the discs and neural structures occurred in 90% of the cases. The most common route of communication was through the intradiscal space, followed by the intervertebral foramen and the epidural space. The incidence of communication was higher in patients with recurrent disc herniation and in those with larger herniated discs. These findings provide valuable insights into the potential pathways through which lumbar disc herniations can affect neural structures. Understanding these communication routes can aid in the diagnosis and management of patients with lumbar disc herniations.",1
"Rapid control of refractory atrial tachyarrhythmias with high-dose oral amiodarone.  To shorten the delay in the onset of antiarrhythmic effect when using amiodarone for the conversion of refractory atrial tachyarrhythmias to sinus rhythm, 19 patients were given oral amiodarone according to a high-dose loading protocol. Atrial tachyarrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation, can be challenging to manage, especially when refractory to standard antiarrhythmic agents. Amiodarone is a commonly used drug for the conversion of atrial tachyarrhythmias to sinus rhythm, but its slow onset of action may delay achieving therapeutic effect. In this study, we aimed to assess the efficacy of high-dose oral amiodarone in rapidly controlling refractory atrial tachyarrhythmias. Nineteen patients with persistent or recurrent atrial tachyarrhythmias resistant to other antiarrhythmic medications were administered oral amiodarone in a high-dose loading protocol. The results demonstrated a significant reduction in the duration and frequency of atrial tachyarrhythmias within a short period, with 84% of patients achieving sinus rhythm within 24 hours. Adverse events were generally mild and manageable. These findings suggest that high-dose oral amiodarone may be an effective and well-tolerated strategy for the rapid control of refractory atrial tachyarrhythmias. Further studies are warranted to confirm these results and evaluate long-term outcomes.",1

"Reversed lateralization of cognitive functions in right handers. Recent neuroimaging studies have shown that cognitive functions are not strictly lateralized to the left hemisphere in right-handed individuals. In this study, we aimed to investigate the phenomenon of reversed lateralization of cognitive functions in right-handers. We recruited a cohort of right-handed participants and performed a battery of cognitive tests, including language, visuospatial, and executive function tasks. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to measure brain activity during task performance. The results revealed that a subset of right-handed individuals exhibited reversed lateralization patterns, with language functions predominantly located in the right hemisphere and visuospatial and executive functions primarily localized to the left hemisphere. Furthermore, these individuals showed similar patterns of brain activation as typically left-handed individuals. Our findings suggest that the traditional model of cognitive lateralization may not be applicable to all right-handed individuals and emphasize the importance of considering individual differences in future studies of cognitive function.",1
"Ichthyosis, mental retardation, and asymptomatic spasticity. Ichthyosis, mental retardation, and asymptomatic spasticity (IMARSA) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the presence of ichthyosis, intellectual disability, and spasticity without any accompanying symptoms. This condition has been reported in only a few cases globally, with the exact prevalence remaining uncertain. The clinical presentation of IMARSA is variable, with individuals displaying varying degrees of ichthyosis, ranging from mild dry skin to severe scaling and thickening of the skin. Additionally, affected individuals typically exhibit intellectual disability, ranging from mild to severe, and may also present with spasticity in the absence of any other neurological abnormalities. The genetic basis of IMARSA is currently unknown, with no specific gene or mutation identified. Diagnosis relies on clinical presentation and exclusion of other known genetic disorders presenting with similar symptoms. Management is mainly supportive, focusing on symptom relief and interventions to optimize quality of life for affected individuals. Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying genetic mechanisms and develop specific targeted treatments for IMARSA.",1

"Spontaneous perinephric hemorrhage: imaging and management. Spontaneous perinephric hemorrhage is a rare condition characterized by the spontaneous rupture of blood vessels in the perinephric space. This condition can lead to significant morbidity and mortality if not promptly diagnosed and managed. We present a retrospective analysis of 25 cases of spontaneous perinephric hemorrhage, diagnosed and managed at our institution between 2005 and 2019.

Clinical presentation included acute flank pain, hematuria, and hypovolemic shock in the majority of patients. Imaging played a crucial role in the diagnosis, with contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) being the most commonly utilized modality. CT scan revealed perinephric hematoma with active extravasation of contrast material in the majority of cases. In cases where a CT scan was contraindicated, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging provided valuable diagnostic information.

Management strategies varied based on the severity of hemorrhage and hemodynamic stability of the patient. Conservative management with close monitoring and blood transfusion was successful in the majority of cases. However, some patients required more aggressive intervention, including embolization or surgical exploration.

"Endoscopic ventricular fenestration using a ""saline torch"".  The fiberoptic endoscope has never gained popularity among neurosurgeons although it is ideally suited for navigating within the cerebral ventricles. Endoscopic ventricular fenestration is a minimally invasive procedure used in the treatment of hydrocephalus. However, current techniques have limitations and are associated with certain complications. This study introduces a novel technique called ""saline torch"" for endoscopic ventricular fenestration using a fiberoptic endoscope. 

A total of 25 patients with symptomatic hydrocephalus were included in this study. The saline torch technique involves the introduction of a fiberoptic endoscope into the cerebral ventricles under general anesthesia. A saline solution is then injected through the endoscope, creating a clear line of vision. Using this technique, fenestration of the ventricular wall was successfully performed in all patients, providing immediate improvement in symptoms.

The saline torch technique offers several advantages over traditional techniques, including improved visualization and increased precision. Additionally, it minimizes the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage and other complications associated with mechanical fenestration techniques.

In conclusion, the saline torch technique for endoscopic ventricular fenestration using a fiberoptic endoscope is a safe and effective alternative for the treatment of hydrocephalus. Further studies are warranted to validate these findings and explore the long-term outcomes.",1

"Infarct of the conus medullaris simulating a spinal cord tumor: case report. We present the case of a 42-year-old male patient who presented with symptoms suggestive of a spinal cord tumor. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a mass lesion involving the conus medullaris. Considering the high suspicion of a tumor, the patient underwent surgical resection of the lesion. However, intraoperatively, the lesion was found to be consistent with an infarct rather than a tumor. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of infarct. The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery and showed improvement in his symptoms. Infarct of the conus medullaris is a rare condition that can mimic a spinal cord tumor on imaging. Awareness of this diagnostic dilemma is crucial to prevent unnecessary interventions and guide appropriate management strategies.",1
"Unusual aspects of aortovenous fistulas associated with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms. Aortovenous fistulas (AVFs) are rare complications associated with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). In this retrospective study, we describe the unusual aspects of AVFs observed in 19 patients presenting with ruptured AAA. Our analysis revealed that all patients with AVFs presented with significant hemodynamic instability and hemorrhagic shock. Additionally, a delay in the diagnosis of AVFs was noted, with the majority of cases initially misdiagnosed as simpler arterial injuries. Surgical repair of the aneurysm and AVF was performed in all patients, with a mortality rate of 47%. We also observed distinct anatomical features of the AVFs, including multiple fistulous connections and the presence of venous pseudoaneurysms. Furthermore, certain clinical factors, such as larger aneurysm size and advanced age, were associated with a higher likelihood of AVF occurrence. Our findings highlight the importance of considering AVFs as a potential complication in patients with ruptured AAA and underscore the need for prompt diagnosis and surgical intervention to improve patient outcomes.",1

"Epstein-Barr virus associated oesophageal ulcers in AIDS. Oesophageal ulcers are a common manifestation of advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, typically caused by opportunistic infections such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) or herpes simplex virus (HSV). However, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has also been reported as a causative agent in some cases. This report describes two cases of oesophageal ulcers in patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) where EBV was identified as the underlying etiology. The first patient presented with dysphagia and was found to have multiple ulcers in the distal oesophagus, with histological examination confirming the presence of EBV. The second patient presented with odynophagia and endoscopy revealed a single ulcer, also positive for EBV on histopathology. These cases highlight the importance of considering EBV as a potential cause of oesophageal ulcers in patients with advanced HIV infection, especially when other common etiologies have been ruled out. Further research is needed to better understand the pathogenesis and optimal management of EBV-associated oesophageal ulcers in this population.",1
"Recurrence rate after discontinuation of long-term mebendazole therapy in alveolar echinococcosis (preliminary results).  The recurrence rate was investigated in 19 patients with non-resectable alveolar echinococcosis after discontinuation of a long-term therapy with mebendazole (average treatment 4. 6 years). The patients were followed for a mean duration of 36 months after discontinuation of therapy. Recurrence of alveolar echinococcosis was detected in 5 out of the 19 patients (26%), with an average time to recurrence of 18 months. Four of the recurring patients required reinitiation of mebendazole therapy, while one patient opted for surgical intervention. The remaining 14 patients remained recurrence-free during the follow-up period. Our preliminary results suggest that discontinuation of long-term mebendazole therapy in non-resectable alveolar echinococcosis may result in recurrence in a substantial proportion of patients. Further research is needed to identify factors associated with recurrence and optimize treatment strategies for this challenging disease.",1

"Cumulative load as a risk factor for back pain.  The association between cumulative load (biomechanic load and exposure time integral over the entire work experience) and back pain was investigated in a group of institutional aides with physically stressful jobs. A total of 150 institutional aides with physically demanding jobs were included in this study to investigate the association between cumulative load and back pain. Cumulative load was assessed as a combination of biomechanic load, derived from ergonomic analysis, and exposure time integral over the entire work experience. Back pain was assessed using standardized questionnaires and clinical examinations. 

Results showed a significant positive correlation between cumulative load and the prevalence of back pain in institutional aides. Higher levels of cumulative load were associated with increased odds of experiencing back pain. Additionally, the duration of employment and the number of high-risk tasks performed were found to be significant predictors of back pain.

"The effect of chemotherapy on growth in the skeletally immature individual.  One hundred twenty-two children with nonmetastatic osteogenic or Ewing's sarcoma were studied to assess the effect of multiagent adjuvant chemotherapy on skeletal growth and final stature. The study aimed to evaluate the impact of multiagent adjuvant chemotherapy on skeletal growth and final height in skeletally immature individuals with nonmetastatic osteogenic or Ewing's sarcoma. One hundred twenty-two children were included in the study. Growth parameters were assessed at regular intervals during and after chemotherapy using standing height, sitting height, and lower limb length measurements. Final stature was determined by measuring standing height at skeletal maturity. 

Results showed that chemotherapy had a significant effect on growth in these children. A decrease in growth velocity was observed during treatment, with a subsequent recovery period after the completion of chemotherapy. However, there was a reduction in final stature compared to expected height based on bone age at diagnosis. The reduction in final stature was more pronounced in children who received higher cumulative doses of chemotherapy. These findings suggest that multiagent adjuvant chemotherapy negatively affects skeletal growth and final stature in skeletally immature individuals with nonmetastatic osteogenic or Ewing's sarcoma. Further research is necessary to explore potential interventions to mitigate these effects and improve the overall quality of life for these patients.",1

Surgeons performing PPV should be aware of the potential risk of MSCH and take precautions to minimize its occurrence.",1
"Human cerebral malaria: association with erythrocyte rosetting and lack of anti-rosetting antibodies. Cerebral malaria (CM) is a severe complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection, primarily affecting children in sub-Saharan Africa. The pathogenesis of CM is complex and remains poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the association between CM and erythrocyte rosetting, as well as the presence of anti-rosetting antibodies. 

In a case-control study, 50 children with CM and 50 age-matched controls were enrolled. Peripheral blood samples were collected and analyzed for rosetting, defined as the adherence of infected erythrocytes to uninfected erythrocytes. In addition, sera were tested for the presence of anti-rosetting antibodies using a rosette disruption assay.

The results showed a significantly higher prevalence of rosetting in children with CM compared to controls (p<0.001). However, there was no significant difference in the levels of anti-rosetting antibodies between the two groups.

These findings suggest that erythrocyte rosetting may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of CM.

"Questionable role of CNS radioprophylaxis in the therapeutic management of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma with meningeal extension. The use of central nervous system (CNS) radioprophylaxis in the therapeutic management of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) with meningeal extension remains controversial. Meningeal involvement in RMS is associated with poor prognosis and increased risk of distant metastasis. Historically, CNS radioprophylaxis was implemented based on the assumption that it would reduce the risk of CNS relapse. However, recent studies have questioned its efficacy and raised concerns regarding potential long-term detrimental effects on neurocognitive function. Here, we present a case series of three pediatric patients with RMS and meningeal extension who received CNS radioprophylaxis. Although no CNS relapse was observed in these patients, two of them developed significant neurocognitive impairment. These findings raise concerns about the benefit-risk balance of CNS radioprophylaxis in this patient population. Further research is warranted to determine the optimal therapeutic approach for childhood RMS with meningeal extension and to assess the long-term neurocognitive sequelae associated with CNS radioprophylaxis in this context.",1
"Natural killer cell activity in patients with liver cirrhosis relative to severity of liver damage. Liver cirrhosis is associated with impaired immune function, including altered natural killer (NK) cell activity. However, the relationship between NK cell activity and the severity of liver damage in cirrhotic patients remains unclear. In this study, we examined NK cell activity in patients with liver cirrhosis and assessed its correlation with liver damage severity. A total of 60 cirrhotic patients were divided into three groups based on the Child-Pugh score: mild (n=20), moderate (n=20), and severe (n=20). NK cell activity was determined using a standard chromium-51 release assay. Our results showed that NK cell activity was significantly decreased in cirrhotic patients compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, NK cell activity was inversely correlated with the severity of liver damage, with lower activity observed in patients with higher Child-Pugh scores. These findings indicate that NK cell dysfunction is associated with the progression of liver cirrhosis and suggest that assessing NK cell activity may serve as a valuable marker for monitoring disease severity and guiding therapeutic interventions in cirrhotic patients.",1
"The neuroradiology of visual disturbances.  The neuroradiology of visual deficits has advanced dramatically in recent years. This review article focuses on the neuroradiology of visual disturbances, specifically the advancements in understanding and diagnosing visual deficits using neuroimaging techniques. Visual disturbances can result from a wide range of neurological conditions, including stroke, tumors, trauma, and degenerative diseases. Traditionally, visual deficits were evaluated through clinical examination and imaging modalities, such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, these conventional techniques often provided limited information about the underlying pathology and mechanisms of visual disturbances.

Recent advancements in neuroimaging have revolutionized the field of neuroradiology, allowing for more precise and detailed evaluation of visual deficits. Techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), functional MRI (fMRI), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) have provided insights into the structural and functional changes associated with different visual disturbances. Additionally, specialized imaging protocols, such as visual field testing and retinal imaging, have contributed to the understanding of specific visual deficits, including hemianopia and optic neuropathy.

Understanding the neuroradiology of visual disturbances is crucial for accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning. By elucidating the underlying neurological changes and mechanisms, neuroimaging techniques can aid in differentiating between various etiologies of visual deficits, guiding therapeutic interventions, and monitoring treatment response. Continued advancements in neuroradiology will further enhance our understanding of visual disturbances and improve patient care in the field of ophthalmology and neurology.",1

"Management of renovascular disease. Renovascular disease, also known as renal artery stenosis, is a condition characterized by the narrowing of the renal arteries, leading to impaired blood flow to the kidneys. This can result in hypertension and renal dysfunction. The management of renovascular disease aims to restore renal blood flow and control blood pressure, thereby preventing further kidney damage. 

Treatment options include medical therapy, percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA), and surgical revascularization. Medical therapy involves the use of antihypertensive medications to control blood pressure and manage associated conditions such as diabetes and high cholesterol. PTRA is a minimally invasive procedure that involves the inflation of a small balloon within the narrowed artery, expanding the lumen and improving blood flow. In cases where PTRA is not feasible or unsuccessful, surgical revascularization may be considered. This involves bypassing the blocked or narrowed artery with a graft to restore normal blood flow to the kidneys.

The choice of treatment depends on various factors including the severity of the disease, presence of comorbidities, and patient preference. Close monitoring and regular follow-up are crucial to assess treatment efficacy and optimize long-term renal function.",1

"Microstaging of squamous cell carcinomas. Microstaging is a critical component in the management of squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). It provides detailed information about the depth of invasion, tumor thickness, and involvement of adjacent structures, which are crucial for appropriate treatment planning and prognosis determination. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the utility of microstaging in a cohort of 100 patients with SCCs.

The results showed that microstaging significantly correlated with the risk of lymph node metastasis (p < 0.001) and disease progression (p = 0.003). Patients with deeper invasion and thicker tumors had a higher likelihood of lymph node involvement and poorer prognosis. Additionally, the involvement of adjacent structures was associated with a significantly higher risk of local recurrence (p = 0.012).

Furthermore, microstaging was found to be a valuable tool in guiding treatment decisions. Patients with early-stage disease (microstaging T1) had excellent outcomes with surgery alone, while those with more advanced disease (microstaging T2-T4) benefited from multimodal approaches, including surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

In conclusion, microstaging provides crucial information for risk stratification, treatment planning, and prognostication in SCCs. Its incorporation into routine clinical practice is recommended to optimize patient management and improve outcomes.",1
"An autosomal recessive gene that delays expression of lupus in BXSB mice. The BXSB mouse strain is a well-known model for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, a subline of BXSB mice has been identified that shows a significant delay in the onset and severity of lupus-like disease.

"Progressive coma after the transsphenoidal decompression of a pituitary adenoma with marked suprasellar extension: report of two cases. We report the cases of two patients who developed progressive coma after transsphenoidal decompression surgery for pituitary adenomas with marked suprasellar extension. Both patients initially presented with symptoms of pituitary dysfunction and underwent surgical intervention. However, postoperatively, they experienced a rapid deterioration in consciousness, eventually leading to coma. Imaging studies revealed significant expansion of the suprasellar component of the tumor, causing compression of the optic chiasm and hypothalamus. Despite aggressive medical management and interventions, both patients succumbed to their condition. This highlights the potential complications associated with transsphenoidal decompression in cases of pituitary adenomas with extensive suprasellar involvement. Surgeons should exercise caution and consider alternative treatment strategies in such cases to minimize the risk of postoperative coma and its associated morbidity and mortality.

"Cytologic features of poorly differentiated 'insular' carcinoma of the thyroid, as revealed by fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Poorly differentiated 'insular' carcinoma of the thyroid (PDICT) is a rare subtype of thyroid carcinoma characterized by aggressive behavior and poor prognosis. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is a minimally invasive diagnostic tool routinely used to evaluate thyroid nodules. However, little is known about the cytologic features of PDICT on FNAB, and this knowledge gap hinders accurate pre-operative diagnosis. In this study, we aim to describe the cytologic features of PDICT on FNAB and evaluate their diagnostic utility. A retrospective analysis was performed on FNAB specimens from 25 patients with surgically confirmed PDICT. Cytologic features including cellularity, tumor cell clusters, nuclear morphology, chromatin pattern, and presence of necrosis were assessed. Our results demonstrate that PDICT on FNAB is characterized by high cellularity, small cohesive clusters of tumor cells, marked nuclear pleomorphism, coarse chromatin pattern, and frequent presence of necrosis. These findings can aid in the pre-operative diagnosis of PDICT, thus providing valuable information for treatment planning and prognostic assessment. Further studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to validate these findings and improve the diagnostic accuracy of FNAB for PDICT.",1
"Differences between florid osseous dysplasia and chronic diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis.  Florid osseous dysplasia (FOD) is confused in the literature with chronic diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis. Florid osseous dysplasia (FOD) and chronic diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis (CDSO) are both rare entities presenting as radiopaque lesions in the jaws. FOD is characterized by multiple bilateral radiopaque masses that involve the mandible and maxilla, while CDSO is a chronic inflammatory condition typically affecting the mandible. Despite their similar radiographic appearance, these conditions have distinct clinical and histopathological features. FOD is typically asymptomatic, while CDSO is associated with pain, swelling, and fistula formation. Histologically, FOD is characterized by fibrous tissue with osseous metaplasia and dystrophic calcifications, whereas CDSO shows chronic inflammation with fibrosis and osteomyelitis.

Additionally, neuronal loss and glial cell activation were observed in the gray matter of the affected spinal cord segments. This is the first study to establish an isohistogenic rat upper-half-body transplantation model for investigating spinal cord ischemia, providing valuable insights into its pathogenesis and potential therapeutic strategies.",1
"The incidence of deep vein thrombosis after cementless and cemented knee replacement. The incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) varies depending on the type of fixation method used. This study aimed to compare the incidence of DVT after cementless and cemented knee replacement surgeries. A total of 200 patients who underwent TKA were included in the study. Fifty percent of the patients received cementless implants while the other fifty percent received cemented implants. Doppler ultrasound was performed on all patients within 24 hours postoperatively to screen for DVT. The incidence of DVT was found to be 10% in the cementless group and 20% in the cemented group. There was a statistically significant difference in the incidence of DVT between the two groups (p < 0.05), with the cementless group having a lower risk of DVT. These findings suggest that the use of cementless fixation in TKA may decrease the incidence of DVT compared to cemented fixation. Further studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to confirm these results.",1
"Reduction in bleeding after heart-lung transplantation.  The importance of posterior mediastinal hemostasis. Bleeding is a common complication after heart-lung transplantation, often leading to increased morbidity and mortality rates. In this study, the authors aimed to investigate the impact of posterior mediastinal hemostasis on reducing bleeding in heart-lung transplant recipients. The study included 60 patients who underwent heart-lung transplantation and were divided into two groups based on the surgical technique employed for posterior mediastinal hemostasis.

Group A underwent conventional hemostasis techniques, while Group B received additional efforts to achieve meticulous posterior mediastinal hemostasis. The primary outcome measure was postoperative bleeding volume assessed over the first 48 hours.

"Preferential mitogenic activity for myoblast-like cells can be extracted from uterine leiomyoma tissues. Uterine leiomyoma, also known as fibroids, is a common benign tumor of the uterus. In this study, we investigated the presence of mitogenic activity in uterine leiomyoma tissues and its potential effects on myoblast-like cells. Tissue extracts obtained from leiomyoma specimens were tested for their ability to induce cell proliferation in vitro. Our results showed that these extracts exhibited preferential mitogenic activity for myoblast-like cells compared to normal uterine smooth muscle cells. Furthermore, we observed an increased expression of growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) in the leiomyoma tissues. These findings suggest that uterine leiomyoma tissues possess mitogenic factors that may contribute to the growth and development of these tumors. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the specific mechanisms underlying this preferential mitogenic activity and its implications in leiomyoma pathogenesis.",1
"Levels of mRNA for a putative kainate receptor are affected by seizures. Seizures have been shown to alter the expression of various genes and their corresponding proteins in the brain. One such gene is the putative kainate receptor gene, which is believed to play a role in excitatory neurotransmission. In this study, levels of mRNA coding for the putative kainate receptor were examined in an animal model of seizures. Rats were subjected to induced seizures, and brain tissue samples were collected at various time points following the seizure event. Analysis revealed a significant increase in mRNA levels for the putative kainate receptor in the hippocampus and cortex of seizure-exposed animals compared to controls. These findings suggest that seizures can modulate the expression of the putative kainate receptor, potentially contributing to the pathophysiology of epilepsy and offering a potential target for therapeutic intervention. Further studies are needed to elucidate the functional implications of these changes and explore the therapeutic potential of targeting the putative kainate receptor in the treatment of seizures.",1
"Evaluating oxygen delivery and oxygen utilization with mixed venous oxygen saturation monitoring: a case study approach. This case study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of monitoring mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) in assessing oxygen delivery and utilization in critically ill patients. Ten patients admitted to the intensive care unit were included in this study. SvO2 was continuously monitored using a pulmonary artery catheter, and additional hemodynamic parameters were recorded. The results showed that SvO2 was significantly decreased in patients with impaired oxygen delivery, as indicated by low cardiac output or decreased hemoglobin levels. Furthermore, patients with septic shock exhibited a persistent decrease in SvO2, suggesting impaired oxygen utilization. In contrast, patients with normal cardiac function or those who responded well to treatment showed stable or improved SvO2 levels. These findings suggest that SvO2 monitoring can provide valuable information about oxygen delivery and utilization in critically ill patients, allowing for timely interventions to optimize oxygenation and improve patient outcomes. Further studies are warranted to confirm these findings and establish the clinical utility of SvO2 monitoring.",1
"Association of Escherichia coli HEp-2 adherence patterns with type and duration of diarrhoea. In this study, we investigated the association between Escherichia coli (E. coli) adherence patterns on HEp-2 cells and the type and duration of diarrhoea in patients. Stool samples were collected from 150 patients with acute gastroenteritis. E. coli strains were isolated and subjected to HEp-2 adherence assay. Adherence patterns were classified as localized, aggregative, diffuse, or non-adherent. The type and duration of diarrhoea were recorded for each patient. We found that patients with localized adherence pattern had a higher incidence of watery diarrhoea compared to other adherence patterns (p<0.05). Similarly, patients with aggregative adherence pattern had a longer duration of diarrhoea compared to other patterns (p<0.05). No significant association was observed between diffuse or non-adherent patterns and diarrhoea type or duration. Our findings suggest that E. coli adherence patterns on HEp-2 cells may be associated with the clinical presentation and duration of diarrhoea, providing valuable insights for understanding the pathogenesis of E. coli-induced gastroenteritis.",1

"Oral contraceptives, lipoproteins, and atherosclerosis. Oral contraceptives have been widely used by women as a reliable method of birth control. However, there have been concerns regarding the potential association between oral contraceptive use and the development of atherosclerosis.

This review aims to summarize the available evidence and evaluate the relationship between oral contraceptives, lipoproteins, and atherosclerosis. Several studies have reported an increase in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels among oral contraceptive users, particularly among those using higher doses of estrogen. Furthermore, alterations in lipoprotein metabolism, such as increased levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and decreased levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, have been observed in users of oral contraceptives.

The impact of these lipid changes on the development of atherosclerosis is still controversial. Some studies have linked oral contraceptive use to an increased risk of cardiovascular events, whereas others have found no significant association.

Further research is required to better understand the mechanisms behind these lipid alterations and to determine the overall cardiovascular risk associated with oral contraceptive use. In the meantime, clinicians should carefully consider the potential cardiovascular effects when prescribing oral contraceptives, particularly among women with underlying cardiovascular risk factors.",1
"Clinical observation on the association of gallstones and colorectal cancer.  A possible association between gallstones, colorectal cancer, and gastric cancer was investigated. A total of 500 patients diagnosed with colorectal or gastric cancer were enrolled for this clinical observation study. Among them, 200 patients had gallstones detected during routine preoperative imaging or surgery. The presence of gallstones was significantly associated with an increased occurrence of colorectal cancer, with 58% of patients with colorectal cancer having concurrent gallstones. In contrast, only 22% of gastric cancer patients had gallstones. Furthermore, patients with both colorectal cancer and gallstones were more likely to present with advanced stage disease compared to those without gallstones. This association remained significant after adjusting for potential confounding factors such as age, sex, and BMI. These findings suggest a possible link between gallstones and colorectal cancer development, indicating that gallstones may serve as a risk factor or contributor to the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer.

"Toward a rational therapeutic strategy for arachnoiditis. Arachnoiditis is a debilitating condition characterized by inflammation of the arachnoid membrane surrounding the spinal cord. Despite its significant impact on patients' quality of life, there is currently no consensus on optimal treatment strategies for arachnoiditis. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing literature on arachnoiditis treatment and propose a rational therapeutic strategy for this condition.

A thorough literature search was conducted to identify relevant studies on arachnoiditis treatment. The results suggest that a multidisciplinary approach, involving pharmacological, interventional, and rehabilitative therapies, holds promise in managing arachnoiditis symptoms effectively. While no single treatment option has demonstrated definitive efficacy, there is evidence supporting the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, corticosteroids, and physical therapy as part of a multimodal treatment approach.

Based on the available evidence, we propose a rational therapeutic strategy for arachnoiditis that considers individual patient characteristics, symptom severity, and treatment response. This strategy emphasizes the importance of a personalized approach, targeting both pain relief and functional improvement, while minimizing the risk of adverse effects. Further research is warranted to validate the proposed therapeutic strategy and explore innovative treatment modalities for arachnoiditis.",1

"Patient-controlled analgesia in children.  We report our experience in introducing patient-controlled analgesia at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow.  Twenty-five children used the technique after orthopaedic or general surgery using the Graseby system. Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) has been widely used in adult populations to provide effective pain management. However, its application in children has been limited due to concerns about safety and efficacy. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the implementation and outcomes of PCA in children at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow. 

A total of 25 children, who underwent orthopaedic or general surgery, were included in the study and utilized the Graseby PCA system for pain management. The system allowed the children to self-administer analgesic medication within predetermined safety limits, providing them with increased control over their pain relief. 

Preliminary results showed that PCA was well-tolerated and effective in managing postoperative pain in children. Pain scores were significantly reduced, and the need for rescue analgesia was minimal. Furthermore, the incidence of opioid-related adverse events was low, indicating the safety of the PCA approach in children. These findings suggest that PCA can be a valuable tool in pediatric pain management, providing tailored analgesia while minimizing the side effects associated with traditional analgesic approaches. Further research is warranted to optimize the technique and evaluate long-term outcomes.",1

"Chronic pain in primary care.  Identification and management of psychosocial factors. Chronic pain is a prevalent condition that often presents in primary care settings. While there is extensive research on the physiological and biomechanical aspects of pain, the role of psychosocial factors in chronic pain management remains underexplored. This review aims to identify and discuss the psychosocial factors that contribute to the experience and perpetuation of chronic pain. 
Various psychosocial factors, such as depression, anxiety, catastrophizing, and social support, have been found to play a significant role in the development and maintenance of chronic pain. It is crucial for primary care providers to recognize and address these factors as part of a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach to pain management. The implementation of evidence-based interventions, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and psychosocial education, can effectively target and modify these factors, leading to improved pain outcomes and enhanced quality of life for patients with chronic pain. Primary care providers should prioritize the identification and management of psychosocial factors in the care of patients with chronic pain to optimize treatment outcomes.",1
"Transoesophageal echocardiogram may fail to diagnose perioperative myocardial infarction.  We report a case in which a 55-yr-old man undergoing aortocoronary bypass was monitored with electrocardiogram and transoesophageal echocardiogram. Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) is a commonly used imaging modality for the detection of perioperative myocardial infarction (MI). However, there are occasional instances where TOE may fail to diagnose this serious complication. In this case report, we present the experience of a 55-year-old male patient who underwent aortocoronary bypass surgery and was monitored with both electrocardiogram (ECG) and TOE. Despite continuous monitoring during the procedure, TOE failed to detect a perioperative MI, while ECG showed significant changes indicative of myocardial ischemia. This highlights the limitations of TOE in detecting myocardial infarction and emphasizes the importance of combining multiple modalities, such as ECG, troponin levels, and clinical assessment, for accurate diagnosis. Further research is warranted to explore alternative or adjunctive imaging techniques that can improve the sensitivity and specificity of perioperative MI detection. Healthcare providers should be aware of the limitations of TOE in order to ensure timely diagnosis and appropriate management of this potentially life-threatening condition.",1

"Photochemotherapy improves chronic cutaneous graft-versus-host disease.  We have used oral psoralen photochemotherapy (PUVA) to treat four patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease of the skin, oral mucosa, and liver, who had responded only partially to long-term immunosuppressive therapy (prednisolone, cyclosporine, azathioprine). Chronic cutaneous graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a common complication following allogeneic stem cell transplantation, associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Standard immunosuppressive therapy is often ineffective in achieving complete remission. This study evaluates the efficacy of oral psoralen photochemotherapy (PUVA) in four patients with chronic cGVHD who had previously shown partial response to long-term immunosuppressive therapy. PUVA involves administration of oral psoralen, followed by exposure to UVA light. All four patients demonstrated marked improvement in cutaneous symptoms, including erythema, sclerosis, and ulceration, following PUVA treatment. The therapy was well-tolerated with minimal adverse effects. This suggests that PUVA may be a valuable therapeutic option for patients with chronic cGVHD who have not responded adequately to conventional immunosuppressive therapies. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the optimal treatment protocol and long-term outcomes.",1

"Aneuploidy in pancreatic insulinomas does not predict malignancy. Insulinomas are rare neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas that secrete excessive amounts of insulin. The presence of aneuploidy, an abnormal number of chromosomes, in these tumors has been suggested as a potential indicator of malignancy. However, the prognostic value of aneuploidy in insulinomas remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between aneuploidy and malignancy in pancreatic insulinomas. A total of 45 patients with surgically resected insulinomas were included in the analysis. Chromosome analysis by karyotyping was performed on tumor samples to determine the presence of aneuploidy. The results showed that 13 out of 45 insulinomas exhibited aneuploidy. However, there was no statistically significant difference in clinical characteristics or tumor behavior between insulinomas with or without aneuploidy. Therefore, the presence of aneuploidy in pancreatic insulinomas does not appear to predict malignancy or influence their clinical behavior. Further research is needed to identify other prognostic markers for insulinoma malignancy.",1
"Structural and ultrastructural study of the ovary in childhood leukemia after successful treatment. The ovaries of childhood leukemia survivors can be affected by the chemotherapy treatments used to manage the disease. In this study, the structural and ultrastructural changes in the ovaries of 15 female patients who had successfully completed leukemia treatment were examined. The patients ranged in age from 3 to 15 years at the time of diagnosis and had undergone chemotherapy for a period of 1 to 7 years. The ovaries were analyzed using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and immunohistochemistry. The results showed that the treated ovaries exhibited significant changes in the structure and ultrastructure of the ovarian follicles and stroma compared to control ovaries. Additionally, there was a decrease in the number of primordial follicles and an increase in fibrosis in the treated ovaries. These findings suggest that chemotherapy treatment for childhood leukemia may have long-term effects on the structure and function of the ovaries, potentially leading to reproductive complications in the future.",1
"The management of postoperative chylous ascites. Chylous ascites is a rare complication following abdominal surgery. This study aimed to evaluate the management of postoperative chylous ascites and its associated outcomes. A retrospective analysis of 35 patients diagnosed with postoperative chylous ascites was conducted. The majority of cases (68.6%) were due to oncologic surgeries, particularly in the gastric and colorectal regions. Conservative management was attempted initially in 21 patients, including dietary modifications and total parenteral nutrition. However, 7 patients required additional interventions such as percutaneous drainage or surgical exploration due to persistent or worsening symptoms. Among the surgically managed cases, 4 patients required lymphatic ligation and pleurodesis, resulting in successful resolution of chylous ascites. Overall, the management of postoperative chylous ascites should be individualized based on clinical presentation and response to conservative measures. Surgical interventions should be considered in cases of refractory or severe symptoms.",1
"Effects of supplemental oxygen administration in an infant with pulmonary artery hypertension. OBJECTIVES: Pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) is a life-threatening condition in infants, and administration of supplemental oxygen is a commonly used intervention.

"Tissue changes around loose prostheses. Loose prostheses, whether joint replacements or other implantable devices, can lead to significant tissue changes in the surrounding area. These changes include necrosis, fibrosis, inflammation, and bone resorption. The extent and severity of these changes may depend on various factors, including the type and location of the prosthesis, the duration of implantation, and the individual patient's immune response.

Necrosis of the surrounding soft tissues can occur due to compromised blood supply caused by mechanical pressure or infection. Fibrosis, characterized by the excessive deposition of collagen fibers, can lead to tissue contracture and loss of function. Inflammation is a common response to the presence of a foreign body, and it can further contribute to tissue damage. Bone resorption is another important consequence of loose prostheses, often resulting from the migration or instability of the implant.

Understanding these tissue changes is crucial for diagnosing and managing complications associated with loose prostheses. Early detection and prompt intervention, such as revision surgery or antimicrobial therapy, may be necessary to prevent further deterioration and improve patient outcomes.

"Movement disorders--limb movement and the basal ganglia. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between limb movement and the basal ganglia in movement disorders. A total of 100 patients with movement disorders were included in this study. Detailed clinical evaluations, including medical history, physical and neurological examinations, and neuroimaging studies, were performed. The patients were divided into two groups: those with abnormal limb movements (n=50) and those without abnormal limb movements (n=50). The results showed that all patients with abnormal limb movements had abnormalities in the basal ganglia on neuroimaging studies. In contrast, only 20% of patients without abnormal limb movements had basal ganglia abnormalities. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between the severity of limb movement abnormalities and the extent of basal ganglia involvement. These findings suggest that the basal ganglia play a crucial role in the generation of abnormal limb movements in movement disorders. Further research is needed to elucidate the specific mechanisms underlying this relationship and to develop targeted therapeutic interventions for patients with movement disorders.",1

"Florid refractory schizophrenias that turn out to be treatable variants of HLA-associated narcolepsy. We present two cases of refractory schizophrenias that were ultimately diagnosed as treatable variants of HLA-associated narcolepsy. Both patients initially presented with severe psychosis and treatment-resistant schizophrenia symptoms. However, further evaluation revealed abnormal sleep patterns and excessive daytime sleepiness, prompting a suspicion for an underlying sleep disorder. Subsequent genetic testing confirmed the presence of HLA-DQB1*06:02, a known risk allele for narcolepsy. Treatment with narcolepsy-specific medications, such as stimulants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, resulted in significant improvement in psychosis and sleep disturbances in both cases. These cases highlight the importance of considering narcolepsy as a potential differential diagnosis in refractory cases of schizophrenia and the potential for targeted treatment to improve outcomes. Further research is warranted to explore the neurobiological mechanisms underlying this association.",1

"Hyponatraemia in patients with cirrhosis. Hyponatraemia, the condition of low sodium levels in the blood, is a common complication observed in patients with cirrhosis. This medical abstract aims to review the causes, consequences, and management of hyponatraemia in this patient population. The main etiology of hyponatraemia in cirrhosis is believed to be the impaired renal water excretion due to the presence of vasopressin, a hormone that regulates water balance. This hormone is upregulated in cirrhosis, leading to increased water absorption and dilutional hyponatraemia. The consequences of hyponatraemia in cirrhosis can be severe and include neurological symptoms such as confusion, seizures, and coma. The management of hyponatraemia in these patients should be focused on addressing the underlying cause, such as excessive fluid intake or diuretic use. Various treatment options, including fluid restriction, diuretic adjustment, and administration of vaptans, have been explored. However, the optimal approach is still a topic of debate, and further research is needed to establish evidence-based guidelines for the management of hyponatraemia in patients with cirrhosis.",1

"A randomized trial of the effect of three non-steroid anti-inflammatory agents in ameliorating cancer-induced fever.  Paraneoplastic fever is well known, and is not an uncommon problem in daily practice. Cancer-induced fever is a common manifestation in patients with malignancies and often causes significant morbidity. Despite its clinical importance, there is limited data on the effectiveness of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in managing cancer-induced fever. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of three different NSAIDs on ameliorating cancer-induced fever. 

A randomized trial was conducted among 60 cancer patients with documented cancer-induced fever. These patients were divided into three groups, each receiving a different NSAID: Group A received ibuprofen, Group B received diclofenac, and Group C received naproxen. Fever parameters including temperature, duration, and recurrence were monitored for seven days. 

The results indicated that all three NSAIDs effectively reduced fever in cancer patients. However, Group A, receiving ibuprofen, demonstrated the greatest reduction in fever parameters compared to the other groups. No major adverse events were reported in any of the groups. 

In conclusion, among the studied NSAIDs, ibuprofen showed the most promising efficacy in ameliorating cancer-induced fever. Further research is warranted to establish the optimal dosing and long-term safety profile of NSAIDs in this patient population.",1
"Reproducibility of growth hormone testing procedures: a comparison between 24-hour integrated concentration and pharmacological stimulation.  The purpose of this study was to compare the reproducibility of two approaches to the evaluation of GH secretion: the integrated concentration of GH (IC-GH), a physiological test of GH secretion, and pharmacological stimulation tests. A total of 32 adults deemed to have impaired GH secretion were enrolled in the study. Each participant underwent two separate testing sessions, with a minimum interval of one month between sessions. The IC-GH was measured by collecting blood samples every 20 minutes over a 24-hour period. Pharmacological stimulation was done using two different agents, clonidine and arginine, on separate days. GH secretion was evaluated by the quantification of peak GH levels. 

Statistical analysis revealed that the IC-GH demonstrated higher reproducibility compared to the pharmacological stimulation tests. The coefficient of variation for IC-GH was 8.2%, whereas for the pharmacological tests it ranged from 14.5% to 18.9%. Interclass correlation coefficient analysis also favored the IC-GH, with a value of 0.92 compared to 0.79 and 0.68 for the clonidine and arginine tests, respectively.

In conclusion, the 24-hour IC-GH test showed better reproducibility compared to pharmacological stimulation tests in evaluating GH secretion. This suggests that the IC-GH may be a more reliable and practical method for assessing GH secretion in clinical practice.",1

"Translocation (9;22) is associated with extremely poor prognosis in intensively treated children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Translocation (9;22), also known as the Philadelphia chromosome, is a chromosomal abnormality that is associated with a poor prognosis in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This study aimed to evaluate the outcome of intensive treatment in children with this specific translocation. Forty-five children with ALL and translocation (9;22) were included in the study, and they received aggressive chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation. Despite the intensive treatment, the overall survival rate in this cohort was found to be extremely poor, with only 20% of patients surviving more than two years. Additionally, these patients had a higher risk of relapse and a shorter event-free survival compared to children without this translocation. Therefore, alternative treatment strategies should be investigated for this high-risk subgroup of ALL patients to improve their prognosis.",1
"Endoscopic placement of a Foley catheter across a stricture and rectovaginal fistula to perform a barium enema.  Evaluation of enteric fistulas is often best performed with barium contrast studies. Enteric fistulas, including rectovaginal fistulas, can cause significant morbidity and require accurate evaluation for appropriate management. Barium contrast studies, such as barium enema, are commonly used to assess the anatomy and function of the gastrointestinal tract in these cases. However, in the presence of strictures or fistulas, traditional administration of barium can be challenging. We report a case where an endoscopic technique was employed to overcome these limitations. A Foley catheter was placed across the stricture and rectovaginal fistula under direct endoscopic visualization. This facilitated the administration of barium through the catheter, allowing for thorough evaluation of the enteric fistula. This technique proved to be safe and effective, providing valuable diagnostic information for guiding further management decisions. Endoscopic placement of a Foley catheter across strictures and fistulas presents a feasible approach in situations where conventional barium studies are hindered by anatomical abnormalities.",1
"The risk of large bowel cancer after partial gastrectomy for benign ulcer disease.  The relative risk (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] for colorectal cancer after partial gastrectomy for ulcer disease was examined in a population-based cohort comprising 6459 patients operated during 1950 to 1958.  Follow-up through 1983 revealed 131 cases of colorectal cancer versus 150. The study aimed to investigate the risk of large bowel cancer following partial gastrectomy for benign ulcer disease. A population-based cohort consisting of 6459 patients who underwent partial gastrectomy between 1950 and 1958 was examined. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was used to determine the relative risk of colorectal cancer after surgery. Follow-up was conducted until 1983, and during this period, 131 cases of colorectal cancer were observed, compared to an expected number of 150 cases. The findings suggest that there is a slightly decreased risk of developing colorectal cancer following partial gastrectomy for benign ulcer disease. However, further research is required to fully understand the underlying mechanisms and long-term implications.",1
"Amyloidosis of the small intestine: findings on double-contrast radiographs. Amyloidosis is a rare disorder characterized by the deposition of amyloid protein in various organs, including the small intestine. Double-contrast radiography has been suggested as a useful imaging technique for detecting small intestinal amyloidosis. We present the findings of double-contrast radiographs in five patients with confirmed small intestinal amyloidosis. The radiographs demonstrated characteristic findings, including multiple nodular mucosal irregularities, thickening of the folds, and luminal narrowing. These findings were more pronounced in the distal small intestine. In addition, luminal ulcerations and strictures were seen in some patients. Double-contrast radiography was able to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the small bowel in patients with amyloidosis. It can aid in the diagnosis and assessment of the extent and severity of small intestinal involvement in amyloidosis.",1
"Hemolytic transfusion reaction following transfusion of frozen and washed autologous red cells A case of hemolytic transfusion reaction, accompanied by hypotension and followed by transient renal failure, occurred after the transfusion of 1 unit of previously frozen autologous red cells. In this case report, we describe a rare instance of a hemolytic transfusion reaction following the transfusion of frozen and washed autologous red cells. The patient experienced hypotension and subsequently developed transient renal failure. This adverse event highlights the importance of carefully monitoring patients during transfusions, even when using autologous blood products. Healthcare providers should be aware of the potential risks associated with frozen and washed red cell transfusions to prevent such reactions and ensure patient safety.",1
