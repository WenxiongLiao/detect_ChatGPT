There is also an increase in interstitial marking seen at the right lung, indicating interstitial pulmonary edema. Cardiac size appears to be within normal limits. No pneumothorax or significant pleural effusions are identified. Biapical pleural thickening and scarring as well as elevation of the right minor fissure remain unchanged. This imaging study is being compared to a prior study performed earlier in the morning. Overall, there is progressive left lung consolidation and new interstitial abnormality most evident in the right lung. Given the patient's history of tricuspid valve replacement and right thoracotomy, further evaluation and management are recommended.

"There are no prior studies available for comparison.  
TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast head CT. Nondistended loops of small and large bowel are observed in the abdomen and pelvis, accompanied by a moderate amount of stool in the colon. Scattered air-fluid levels are identified within these nondistended loops, but no free intraperitoneal air is detected. The stomach exhibits prominence of the gastric folds, potentially attributed to incomplete distention or gastritis. The impression of the examination reveals a nonspecific, nonobstructed bowel gas pattern. Furthermore, there is a questionable thickening of the gastric folds, which may be due to incomplete distention or could be indicative of gastritis. No prior studies are available for comparison. The technique employed for this examination is a noncontrast head CT.",1
