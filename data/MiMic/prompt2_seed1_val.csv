"PA AND LATERAL CHEST, [**2102-4-16**] 
OMPARISON:  [**2102-4-14**]. 
FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Airspace consolidation in the left lower lobe has worsened and is concerning for an evolving pneumonia.  Subtle hazy ground-glass opacity lateral to right hilum could reflect an additional site of infection.  Bronchial wall thickening is mild and suggest coexisting airways infection or inflammation.  Small pleural effusions are present bilaterally, left greater than right. 
IMPRESSION:  Evolving pneumonia in left lower lobe as well as possible new site of infection in right perihilar region.  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 35223**] was telephoned with these findings on [**2102-4-16**] at 10 a.m.",0

The liver is diffusely heterogeneous in echotexture, consistent with end-stage liver disease. The portal vein appears patent without evidence of thrombosis. There is dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts, suggestive of biliary obstruction. No focal liver lesions are identified. The gallbladder appears normal. The pancreas is poorly visualized due to overlying bowel gas. No peripancreatic fluid collections are seen. There is moderate ascites present. The spleen is enlarged, measuring [measurement]. No splenic or renal masses are identified. The kidneys appear normal in size and echotexture. No evidence of hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis. Overall, findings are consistent with end-stage liver disease with dilated intrahepatic bile ducts and moderate ascites. No acute findings noted.",1
"INDICATION:  Hypoxia, assess for acute process.  
TECHNIQUE:  Single AP upright radiograph of the chest. CHEST, PA: The heart size is within normal limits. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unremarkable. There is a moderate-sized left pleural effusion present. A retrocardiac opacity is seen, which is obscuring the left hemidiaphragm. The right lung appears clear. Soft tissue calcification is noted in the right axilla, unchanged from previous imaging. No significant bony abnormalities are seen. 

IMPRESSION: Moderate-sized left pleural effusion with associated retrocardiac opacity. Differential diagnosis includes pneumonia or atelectasis of the left lower lobe. Clinical correlation is recommended. 

INDICATION: Hypoxia evaluation for acute process. 

TECHNIQUE: Single AP upright chest radiograph was performed.",1
"HISTORY:  57-year-old male with subarachnoid hemorrhage, now intubated, referred for assessment of endotracheal tube position.  
COMPARISON:  Prior study from 1 hour and 50 minutes ago. FINDINGS: The endotracheal tube is positioned within the trachea at an appropriate level, unchanged from prior study. No signs of endobronchial intubation or complications related to the tube position. Lung fields are clear without evidence of pneumothorax or pulmonary infiltrates. Mediastinal structures are within normal limits. No acute findings. 
IMPRESSION: Endotracheal tube in appropriate position without complications. No acute abnormalities identified.",1
"MRI OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT AND WITH GADOLINIUM 
Comparison is made with 5/22/08/ 
HISTORY:  Metastatic brain tumors.  
There is a postoperative cavity in the right frontal lobe with mild marginal enhancement. MRI of the brain without and with gadolinium was performed to evaluate metastatic brain tumors. A postoperative cavity is present in the right frontal lobe with mild marginal enhancement. No other significant abnormalities are identified. 
Impression: Postoperative cavity in the right frontal lobe with mild marginal enhancement, consistent with the surgical resection. No evidence of new or recurrent metastatic brain tumors. 
Comparison is made with the previous MRI from 5/22/08.",1
"INDICATIONS:  59-year-old man status post fall down the stairs, unresponsive and intubated.   Status post ET tube placement. Compared to previous study of earlier the same date, there has been an advancement of the nasogastric tube, which now terminates in the distal stomach. Other lines and tubes remain unchanged in position. The lung volumes have slightly increased, which may contribute to the apparent improvement in multifocal bilateral pulmonary opacities. However, when compared to an earlier study of the same date with similar lung volumes, there is no significant change in the appearance of the lungs. 

The patient, a 59-year-old man, had a history of falling down the stairs and was found unresponsive. He underwent intubation and is currently post ET tube placement. This recent chest radiograph was performed to confirm the position of the nasogastric tube.  

In summary, there has been an advancement of the nasogastric tube and slight increase in lung volumes, but no significant change in the appearance of the lungs compared to an earlier study.",1
"INDICATION:  Labile blood pressure and rising creatinine.  
RENAL ULTRASOUND:  Both kidneys are small with the right kidney measuring 9. FINDINGS: Renal ultrasound demonstrates small kidneys with the right kidney measuring 9 cm. No hydronephrosis or renal masses are identified. The renal parenchymal echogenicity appears normal bilaterally. The renal vasculature is not fully evaluated due to limited visualization. No significant abnormalities are identified in the perinephric spaces. 

IMPRESSION: Small kidneys, with the right kidney measuring 9 cm, in a patient with labile blood pressure and rising creatinine. Further evaluation may be warranted to assess for underlying renal pathology.",1
